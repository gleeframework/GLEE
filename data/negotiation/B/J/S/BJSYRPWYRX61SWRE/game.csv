,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your potential gains and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see it in your capable hands.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
