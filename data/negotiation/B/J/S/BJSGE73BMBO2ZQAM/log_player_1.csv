{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  This should hopefully pique Bob's interest while also giving me some wiggle room if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance by meeting Bob halfway.  $140 is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go that low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one last counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to do $135.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer that's just above my minimum. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's the highest I can go. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll take it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell to John for $150. It's a better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer."
