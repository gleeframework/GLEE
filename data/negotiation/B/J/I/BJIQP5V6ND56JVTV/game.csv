"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That way we both come out a little ahead.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
