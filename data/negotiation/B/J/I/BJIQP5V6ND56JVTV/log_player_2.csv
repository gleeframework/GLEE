Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired price point. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. There are still several rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way we both come out a little ahead."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd love to get it for even less, at $11,250 I'm saving a good amount compared to the $12,000 John is selling it for.  It's also worth noting that we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
