"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
