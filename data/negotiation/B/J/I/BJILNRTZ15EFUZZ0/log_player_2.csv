"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. This product has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it is worth $1,200,000. We hope this offer aligns well with your valuation and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value of the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This amount still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more flexible within your budget constraints.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget, and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject another counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the current offer is a good balance between getting a good deal and minimizing risk."
