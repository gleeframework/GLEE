"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good middle ground between my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still leaving a profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum of $80, and it's close enough to my initial offer that it's worth accepting.  There's a good chance that I might be able to get a better price in the next rounds, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away or that I won't be able to close a deal before I have to sell to John. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing out altogether."
