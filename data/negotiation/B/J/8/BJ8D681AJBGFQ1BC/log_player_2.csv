"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Bob is willing to pay up to $100, rejecting Alice's offer keeps the door open for a potential lower price from another seller (in this case, John)."
