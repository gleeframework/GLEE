"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $7500 is below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This price still gives you a good value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal at this price!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a lower price. While I appreciate your persistence,  $7750 still falls short of my minimum.  Let's split the difference: I'll accept $8250. It's a good compromise and allows us to move forward with the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $8250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $7875. Can you consider this offer?",7875.0,Bob,6,
