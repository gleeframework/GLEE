"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds:**  There's time to try and get a better price. 
* **Counteroffering is the best strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $95 is still a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum price of $120.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $95 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** There's still space for both of you to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a reduction from her previous offer, $102 is still higher than your desired price.
* **There's room for further negotiation:** You're still within your budget and have multiple rounds left to get a better deal.
* **Counteroffering allows for better control:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can send a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $102 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your target:**  $98 is a small increase from your previous offer but still leaves room for a slight compromise from Alice.
* **Showing commitment:** A small increase demonstrates you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Leaving room for potential agreement:**  The gap between $98 and Alice's $102 is smaller, increasing the likelihood of a compromise."
