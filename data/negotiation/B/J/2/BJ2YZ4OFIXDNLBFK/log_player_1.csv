Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start too low. There's room for negotiation, and a higher initial offer leaves space for that. 
* **Staying below John's offer:** We know John will buy the product for $150, so there's no reason to offer it to Bob for less than that.
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter:** A price of $140 gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he wants to haggle a bit, potentially reaching a price that's beneficial for both of us."
