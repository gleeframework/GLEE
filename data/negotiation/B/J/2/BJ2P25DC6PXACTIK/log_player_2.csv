"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial price of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  He has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price from John, but wants to see if he can get a slightly better deal from Alice. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  as it's closer to Alice's desired price than John's offer, but still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $8,000, but getting closer to his goal. It's a better deal than buying from John, but not significantly better.  There is a risk that rejecting this offer might lead to a stalemate or Alice refusing to negotiate further.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice in this situation."
