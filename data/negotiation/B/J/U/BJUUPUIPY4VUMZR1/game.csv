"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. However, $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1050000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $1025000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1037500. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1037500.0,Alice,5,
