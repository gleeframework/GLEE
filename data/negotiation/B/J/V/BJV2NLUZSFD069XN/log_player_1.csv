Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm sticking with $9,000. I've lowered my price several times and I'm confident that Bob will eventually accept. With fewer rounds remaining, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially having to sell to John for less than I want."
