"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit further to $11,250. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're tough! I'm trying to be reasonable here.  How about we make this the final offer - $11,000, and we have a deal?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $11,375. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11375.0,Alice,7,
