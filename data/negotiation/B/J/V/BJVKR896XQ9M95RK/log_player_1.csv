Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my absolute minimum gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves me a tiny bit of wiggle room if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it might be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if he doesn't want to miss out."
