{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to accept.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate downward if Bob counters.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give you an indication of how much he values the product. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Having a backup buyer (John) provides you with the option to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  By refusing Bob's offer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Continue negotiating:** You can now counter with a price closer to your desired range, potentially securing a higher price. 
* **Keep John as an option:** The possibility of selling to John at $8,000 remains if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Starts closer to your minimum:**  $8,500 is still above your minimum of $8,000, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterates the value:**  Mentioning the product's value reminds Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Uses positive language:**  ""Let's make this happen"" creates a more collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  By offering a price closer to your target, you increase the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You are still above your minimum, allowing for further negotiations if necessary. 
* **Show flexibility:**  While not accepting Bob's offer, you demonstrate that you are willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,250 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired range and would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  You're showing that you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Continue negotiating:** You can counter again, potentially securing a higher price closer to your desired range. 
* **Keep John as a backup:** You can still choose to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By continuing to negotiate, you can potentially get a higher price than $7,250.
* **Show determination:**  Consistently rejecting offers below your minimum demonstrates your commitment to achieving a fair price.
* **Avoid settling for less:**  While $7,250 is better than nothing, selling to John for $8,000 is a more advantageous outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7,750, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. It's a fair price that reflects both our positions, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Offers a compromise:** $7,750 is the midpoint between your previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's offer of $7,250.
* **Reiterates fairness:** You emphasize the ""fair price"" and ""happy with this product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value.
* **Uses a positive tone:**  ""What do you say?"" encourages a response and shows a willingness to move forward.

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  The compromise offer signals a desire to finalize the deal.
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:** $7,750 is closer to your minimum than Bob's offer, but still allows for some profit. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  This offer is a strong attempt to secure a deal and avoid further rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,500 is a better offer than previous ones, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. You've already tried to reach a compromise, and Bob's counteroffer indicates that he's unlikely to go higher.  

Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees you your minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  It's the most reliable way to ensure a profitable outcome at this point."
