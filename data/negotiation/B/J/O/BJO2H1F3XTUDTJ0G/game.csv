"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's try to make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7750, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. It's a fair price that reflects both our positions, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at this price. What do you say?",7750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $7500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
