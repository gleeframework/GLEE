Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate if he feels the price is too high, but it also shows you're confident in the product's worth.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** If Bob counteroffers, you can adjust your price accordingly while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I think the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to $120."

I'm raising the price slightly from $100 to $110. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on the value of the product. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us."
