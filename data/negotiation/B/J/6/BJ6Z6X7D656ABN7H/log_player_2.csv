Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

Alice is clearly trying to inch her way to a higher price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $155, and at this point, buying from John for $150 is the most financially sound decision."
