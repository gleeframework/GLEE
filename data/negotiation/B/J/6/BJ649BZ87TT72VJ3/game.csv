"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000, which is a compromise between your budget and the value I believe the product holds. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value to me. If you're open to it, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
