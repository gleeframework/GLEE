"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. Considering the market value you mentioned, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's quality and uniqueness, but also takes into account my budget constraints. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,2,
