Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $14,000, there's a chance Bob might negotiate down, but you're still likely to end up with a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out on the base value of $10,000.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
