Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $100.

{""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $80. Since $80 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll accept Bob's offer.
