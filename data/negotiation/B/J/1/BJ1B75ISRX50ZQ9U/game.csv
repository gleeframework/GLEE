"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  let's settle on $1,275,000. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
