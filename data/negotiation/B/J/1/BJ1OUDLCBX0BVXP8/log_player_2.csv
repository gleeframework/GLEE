"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $100 limit. While $110 is better than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows another counteroffer to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $108?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $108 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference -  $109.  This way, we can both be happy with the transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $109 is very close to Bob's target price of $100.
* **Potential for Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John. 
* **Time Constraint:**  There are only 5 rounds left. 

Accepting the offer at $109 ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to John's price, without risking further negotiation delays."
