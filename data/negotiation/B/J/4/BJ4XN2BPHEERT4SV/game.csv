"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $12000, so I can offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit below your new offer of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9800, which would be $10150. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your latest offer of $10150. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9500. If you're willing to accept this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made a concession to $11000 and you're now offering $9500, which is even lower than your initial offer. I'm afraid I won't be able to accept this counteroffer. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $11000. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Thank you for considering my offer.",9500.0,Bob,8,
