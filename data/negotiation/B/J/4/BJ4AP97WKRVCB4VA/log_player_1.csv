This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate down. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal you're offering, I'm looking to spend no more than $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $17,500?  This would still give you a great price, and it would ensure I get a fair value for my product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $16250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum value of $15,000 and closer to your desired price than his previous offer. Accepting this offer maximizes your profit while still ensuring a successful sale."
