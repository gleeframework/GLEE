"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $11,000, a price that I think is fair considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product for $11,000.
* This is cheaper than John's offer of $12,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, you risk her increasing the price or you missing out on the deal entirely."
