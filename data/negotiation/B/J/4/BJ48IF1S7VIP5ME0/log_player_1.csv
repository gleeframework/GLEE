I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's very close to my minimum, I'm going to keep negotiating for one more round. I have a strong feeling I can get a better price, and it's worth the risk to see if I can push for that extra $500."

I'm going to sell the product to John. 

Although Bob's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.  I've had 10 rounds of negotiation, and while I've been able to get closer to my goal, I don't think there's enough time left to get a better offer from Bob.  John's offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement."
