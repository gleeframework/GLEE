"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and allows me to reach my minimum price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion. However, $13,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's try $14,000. This would represent a significant savings for you and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",14000.0,Alice,5,
