Round 2

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below your $1,000,000 minimum. At this point, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is small enough that it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John provides a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum, making it the safer and more profitable option."
