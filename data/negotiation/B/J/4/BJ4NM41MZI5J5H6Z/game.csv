"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price. This product is valuable, but not *that* valuable. How about we bring it down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but we're still a ways off. I can go up to $900,000, but that's pushing my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I can tell this is important to you, so I'm willing to offer $975,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
