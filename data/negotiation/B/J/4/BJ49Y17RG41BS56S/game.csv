"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in this product, but that price is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is my best compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is getting close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to do $825,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $900,000 is too low for me, so I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering $950,000. This is the last compromise I can make, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,7,
