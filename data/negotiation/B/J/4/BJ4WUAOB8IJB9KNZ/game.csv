"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
