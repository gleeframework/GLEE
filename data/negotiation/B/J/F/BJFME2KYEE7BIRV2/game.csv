"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do like the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's much closer to what I'm looking to spend.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $157.50. That's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",157.5,Alice,5,
