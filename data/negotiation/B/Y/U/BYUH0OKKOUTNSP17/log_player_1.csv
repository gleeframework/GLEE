Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Knowing my backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows that there's still room for us to find a middle ground.  
* **John's offer as leverage:** I have John's offer as a safety net, giving me confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to meet halfway by offering a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain pressure:**  The message remains polite but assertive, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **John as a fallback:** I still have John's offer as a backup, allowing me to be more confident in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing John, who is willing to pay significantly more.
* **No guarantee of higher offer:**  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob in future rounds.

This is a calculated risk, but given the proximity to my minimum and the potential for losing John, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point."
