Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's a clear margin between my offer and John's offer of $1,000,000. This allows for potential counteroffers and gives me flexibility to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly tone in the message helps create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer, I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not capitulation:** I'm dropping my price from $900,000 to $850,000, showing flexibility. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, reinforcing the reason for a higher price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, suggesting that we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.

**Next Steps:** 

I will carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to consider my options â€“ whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $825,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can shake on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is just $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a relatively small difference, especially considering the potential for continued negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dragging out the process, potentially causing me to miss out on other opportunities or even lose John as a buyer.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, this could potentially lead to future business with him if he's satisfied with the purchase and our negotiations.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation.  It also allows me to explore potential future collaborations with Bob."
