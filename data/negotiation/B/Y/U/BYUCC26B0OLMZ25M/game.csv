"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $825,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can shake on it.",825000.0,Bob,4,
