"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a way from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still beyond my comfortable range. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $14,000. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product while remaining within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
