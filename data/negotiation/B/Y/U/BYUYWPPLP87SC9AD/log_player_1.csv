"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to establish a starting point and gauge his interest.  It also leaves room for negotiation without immediately going to my floor price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. Hopefully, we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident we can reach a deal closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,200.  This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price than Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and Bob refusing to budge on his price, I'm going to sell to John. It's a better deal than Bob's offer and ensures I get my minimum desired price.  I'm confident I'll be able to find another buyer if I need to sell a similar product in the future."
