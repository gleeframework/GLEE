{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:**  This leaves room for potential counteroffers and still allows you to make a profit. 

This strategy focuses on finding a middle ground while ensuring you don't give away too much value upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price. There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's find a way to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  A $50,000 drop shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $950,000 is still within my acceptable range.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There's still some room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  If I reject, I can try to convince Bob to go higher or  explore selling to John as a backup option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $937,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
