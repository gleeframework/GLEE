"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the right hands.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product.** This means there is room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice** or explore other options.
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario, costing you the most.** 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you retain more leverage and avoid overpaying."
