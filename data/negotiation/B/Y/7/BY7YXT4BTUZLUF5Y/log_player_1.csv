Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $140 tempts Bob with a significant discount while still securing a profit above the minimum. 

**Why not higher?**  While we could try a price closer to $150, it risks Bob rejecting the offer. 

**Why not lower?** Offering it for less than $140 significantly reduces the potential profit, especially since there's a guaranteed buyer at $150."
