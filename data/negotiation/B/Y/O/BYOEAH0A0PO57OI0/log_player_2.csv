Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $1200000? This price still allows me some room to profit and should be within your budget. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and $700000 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would be a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can agree on this.

While it's tempting, it's worth seeing if we can push further and secure a lower price from Alice.  We're only a few rounds away from having to purchase from John, so it's worth trying for a better deal."
