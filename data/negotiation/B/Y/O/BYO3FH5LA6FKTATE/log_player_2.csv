"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, so $20,000 is unacceptable.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you open the door to counteroffers and potentially a lower price.
* **John is always an option.**  You have the safety net of buying from John for $15,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but not so low as to seem unreasonable. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still remaining within your budget.
* **Sets the tone:**  This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate seriously, but it also establishes your budget limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $18,000 is still higher than your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's still room to lower the price further through counteroffers.
* **John is always an option:**  You can always secure the product from John for $15,000, so there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your limit:** This counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget of $15,000, showing you are willing to compromise.
* **Testing Alice's willingness:**  It allows you to gauge how serious Alice is about selling at a lower price. 
* **Still room for negotiation:**  While this is a relatively strong counteroffer, it doesn't completely close the gap, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your budget:**  While Alice has come down considerably, $16,500 is still above your maximum of $15,000.
* **Close, but not close enough:** The price is close, but it's worth pushing for a better deal since John is a reliable alternative.
* **Possibility of further negotiation:**  There's still room for Alice to come down further, especially since you've shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your maximum budget, so you're demonstrating that you're serious about buying the product at this price.
* **Testing Alice's limits:**  This forces Alice to make a decision â€“ either accept your final offer or risk losing the sale.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Alice rejects, you can safely move to John for $15,000, ensuring you don't overspend."
