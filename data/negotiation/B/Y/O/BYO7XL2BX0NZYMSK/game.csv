"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $600,000 is quite low, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle somewhere around $700,000? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $700,000 is still too far below my acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
