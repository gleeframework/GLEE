# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on a truly unique item, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You have room to save $100,000 by getting a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $750000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower than $825,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. I'll sell it to you for $820000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

While you could try to negotiate further, the difference between Alice's offer of $820,000 and your maximum budget of $1,000,000 is significant.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you much lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a good price."
