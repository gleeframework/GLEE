Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $900000 is a bit outside my initial price range. I'm willing to consider purchasing it for $600000.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and hopefully make this deal work for both of us.
