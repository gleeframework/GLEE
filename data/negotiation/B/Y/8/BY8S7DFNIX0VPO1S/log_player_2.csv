"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and counteroffer to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and still leaves you with a profit.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and the deal could fall through.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at his limit, saving time and potential further negotiation."
