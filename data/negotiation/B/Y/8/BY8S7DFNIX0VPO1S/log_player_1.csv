Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and still leaves you with a profit.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
