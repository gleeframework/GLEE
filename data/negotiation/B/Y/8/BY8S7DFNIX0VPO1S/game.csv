"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that's within my budget and still leaves you with a profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
