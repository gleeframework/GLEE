{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate but doesn't make the offer too aggressive, potentially making him walk away.
* **It's below my minimum:**  It leaves me some wiggle room to accept a lower counteroffer if necessary without going below my minimum. 
* **It's a clear message:** This message is direct and invites a response, keeping the negotiation moving forward."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can you consider this price?

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I've made several concessions and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. At this point, it's better to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price."
