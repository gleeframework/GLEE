Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?

I will reject Bob's offer. While I would like to close the deal,  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,100,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.
