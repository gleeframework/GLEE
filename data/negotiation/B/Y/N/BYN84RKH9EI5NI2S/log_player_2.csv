"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. My starting price is $950,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While I can't go as low as $850,000, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still be a very fair price for both of us, given the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. He should continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a great deal, and I respect that. Let's split the difference: I'll come down to $887,500.  This is a good compromise that acknowledges your needs while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  At $887,500, Alice is only $37,500 above Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more savings.**  While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or rejecting his offer is high. 
* **The price is still significantly lower than buying from John.**  At $887,500, Bob saves $112,500 compared to buying from John.

It's a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure a decent deal while minimizing risk."
