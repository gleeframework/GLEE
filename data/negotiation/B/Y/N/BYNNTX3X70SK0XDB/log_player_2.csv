"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential compromise. This aggressive approach might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Although Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can make a counteroffer that is closer to his desired price and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. If Alice rejects, Bob can still purchase from John, so there's no risk in continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is just above Alice's minimum selling point.  A counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise, leaving only a small margin of profit for Alice while still being significantly lower than Bob's initial budget. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is only $20,000 higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away from the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price close to his goal and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
