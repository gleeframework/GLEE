I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950000? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
