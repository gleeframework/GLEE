"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I do want to start with a fair price of $1200000. This is a competitive offer considering the product's worth to you is $800000, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $950000? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $950000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. This is still higher than my initial willingness to pay, but it's the best I can offer given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering the product's value to you is $800000 and my minimum selling price is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I propose a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
