"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still allows for a decent profit for me, while being within your budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
