"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal for $1,450,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1,100,000 is a considerable sum, it's unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,250,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe. ",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and represents a significant discount from my initial offer.
