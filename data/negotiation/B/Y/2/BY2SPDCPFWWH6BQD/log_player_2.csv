Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $1,100,000 is a considerable sum, it's unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,250,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and represents a significant discount from my initial offer.

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, but that's the same price John is offering. There's no point in negotiating further with Alice at this stage.  It's time to buy from John."
