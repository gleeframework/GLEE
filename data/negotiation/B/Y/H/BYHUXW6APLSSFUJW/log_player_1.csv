Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $15,000. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $15,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offers are more likely to be closer to my desired range.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($12,000), so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($8,000), it's still significantly below my minimum ($12,000). I have a good alternative with John, so there's no need to settle for a low price. By rejecting and countering, I can gauge how much Bob is willing to budge and move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob.  However, the value of this product is quite high.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving down from $15,000 to $13,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and signaling that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Encourage Counter:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to respond with his own counter, potentially moving closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) after considering the opportunity cost of continuing negotiations. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from Bob. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
