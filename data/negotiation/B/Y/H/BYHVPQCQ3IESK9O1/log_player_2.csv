"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves room for you to get a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to $120, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than what John is offering.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price without further negotiation."
