Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has already stated $8,000 is his absolute limit. While Alice is close, Bob isn't willing to pay more than his maximum. He's better off buying from John for $8,000 and saving the time and effort of further negotiation."
