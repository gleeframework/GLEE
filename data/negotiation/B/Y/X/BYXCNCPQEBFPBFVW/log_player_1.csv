{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is closer to my value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and considering both our values  can make the offer feel more reasonable. 
* **Open to discussion:**  Encouraging Bob to respond gives me an opportunity to see if there's room for compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether his counteroffer is acceptable. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer to try and reach a compromise.
* If the negotiation drags on, I'll have to weigh the risk of selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my price, his offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Not desperate:**  I'm not in a hurry to sell and have a guaranteed backup option with John. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'll keep in mind the value gap between my minimum and John's offer as I negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This would be a win-win, allowing you to get the product at a good price and me to still earn a respectable amount. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $880,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages further negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" scenario, highlighting that this deal is beneficial for both of us.
* **Direct call to action:** I'm explicitly asking Bob to meet in the middle, putting the ball back in his court.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider whether his counteroffer is closer to my minimum or if I should sell to John.
* I'll continue to weigh the risks and potential rewards of further negotiation versus selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am comfortable with an offer of $865000. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness and practicality for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $865,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is not progressing rapidly:**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and the difference in our offers is still significant. 
* **John's offer is more attractive:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 offers a guaranteed and higher return compared to accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be more cautious this time. 
* I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of further negotiation with Bob might not be worth the potential gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $865,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. If you're not able to meet me there, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, but still above my minimum:** I'm offering $875,000, which is a slight move down from my previous offer but still above my minimum of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility without being overly accommodating.
* **Emphasize fair compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Hint at alternatives:** I'm subtly suggesting that I may consider selling to John if Bob doesn't meet my offer. This creates a sense of pressure and motivates Bob to act.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll strongly consider selling to John. 
*  I'll assess the likelihood of Bob coming closer to my desired price and weigh that against the potential loss of the higher guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered our previous discussions, and I am willing to offer $870000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:** Bob's offer of $870,000 is very close to my desired price, but it still falls short of my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** We've been negotiating for several rounds now, and the progress has been slow and incremental. 
* **Guaranteed offer from John:** The guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John is far more attractive than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of getting stuck in a stalemate or him walking away altogether, leaving me with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. 
* This ensures I achieve my desired minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
