"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my valuation. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
