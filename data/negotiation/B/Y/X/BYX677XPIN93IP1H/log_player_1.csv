Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my valuation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
