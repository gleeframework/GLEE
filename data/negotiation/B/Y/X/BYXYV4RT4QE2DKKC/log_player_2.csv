It's a great deal at $500,000, but we can try to get it for even less.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is great, but I'm going to try to see if she'll come down a bit more.  Let's see if $300,000 is a reasonable starting point."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000

$400,000 is a good price. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and likely a fair price for Alice. Let's accept and close the deal."
