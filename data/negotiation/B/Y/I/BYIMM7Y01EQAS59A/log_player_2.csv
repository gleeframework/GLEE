Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $11,750 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and close to Bob's desired price point. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price, so accepting the offer is the best choice for maximizing savings."
