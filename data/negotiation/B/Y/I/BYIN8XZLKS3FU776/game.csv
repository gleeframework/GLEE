"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $6,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
