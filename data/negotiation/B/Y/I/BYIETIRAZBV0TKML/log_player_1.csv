Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a competitive price given the value and unique features of this product.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $2,000,000 gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm giving Bob a reason to consider the price by mentioning the product's value and features.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob to ""discuss further"" if he's interested. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,600,000 is too low:** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount.
* **No urgency:**  I can afford to negotiate further since I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to make this deal work. This is still a fair price considering the product's value and features. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Maintain Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by suggesting a search for ""common ground."" 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1800000, but I'm still not sure I can meet that price. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. While it's not ideal to get my absolute minimum, there's no guarantee I can get more from Bob.
* **No More Negotiation:**  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price from Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum price, avoiding the risk of a further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate."
