"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to go down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $80, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $85, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $92. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",92.0,Alice,5,
