"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profits. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm willing to come down from my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $15,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation. I'd rather secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and potentially getting a lower offer from John."
