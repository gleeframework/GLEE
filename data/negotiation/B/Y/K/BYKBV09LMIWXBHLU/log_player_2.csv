"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to meet roughly in the middle of the current price gap. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $105 is still too high. We can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a significant step up from my last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference from the previous round while emphasizing that it's a significant move on my part. It maintains a steady negotiation pace and aims to land a price below $100."
