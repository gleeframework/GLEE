"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

``` 
This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $11,000 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away. There's a chance he might walk away entirely, leaving you with John's lower offer.  

While you could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal likely outweighs the potential reward.
