Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, even exceeding the benefits you might find elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value"" and comparing it to alternatives, you're aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth closer to your asking price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, securing a deal with Bob above that price is the goal. This opening offer leaves space to potentially negotiate down without going below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is still above his perceived value of $10,000, suggesting there's room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $11,500 would mean selling below your $12,000 minimum and losing out on potential profit. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer. This allows you to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position on saving money.  While I can't go as low as $11,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,750?"", ""product_price"": 12750}

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial price and Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Above Minimum, Encouraging Agreement:** The $12,750 price point is still comfortably above your minimum and leaves room for Bob to potentially accept or offer a counter closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Can you consider $12,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,200 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and you risk him walking away entirely.
* **Secure a Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
