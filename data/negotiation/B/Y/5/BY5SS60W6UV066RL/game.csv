"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough.  The product's value to you is much higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we agree on $750,000? I feel this is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I can't go lower than $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the final price I'm willing to consider.  Think about the long-term value and potential this product holds for your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I am too. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair resolution to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
