Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $700,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not enough.  The product's value to you is much higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we agree on $750,000? I feel this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I can't go lower than $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the final price I'm willing to consider.  Think about the long-term value and potential this product holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I am too. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair resolution to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's clear we're at an impasse.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
