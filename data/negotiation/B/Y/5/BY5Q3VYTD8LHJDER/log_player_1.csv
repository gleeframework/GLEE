{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $14,000 as my initial offer. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product and inviting Bob to respond. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by:

* **Starting high:** A higher initial offer allows for more potential negotiation room.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** The chosen price is still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm prepared to counter-offer or accept Bob's offer if necessary.
* **Having a backup:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I believe I can push for a better price, especially since I know I have a backup buyer willing to pay more.
* **Reasoning:**  Negotiation is a process.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to achieving a price closer to my value.  This also keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his offer.
* **Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'd like to offer you the product for $13,500.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've increased my offer from $14,000 to $13,500, demonstrating willingness to compromise. This amount is still within my acceptable range, but it's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations while emphasizing the product's value and the opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement.  The message is positive and encouraging, promoting continued negotiation.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Find a middle ground:** The price is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
    * **Maintain leverage:**  It's still above Bob's initial offer, indicating I'm not desperate to sell. 
    * **Show flexibility:**  My willingness to counter-offer shows a commitment to reaching an agreement.

This approach should encourage Bob to accept the offer or counter with a price closer to $13,500, leading to a successful sale for a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $12,800 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have a backup buyer.
* **Reasoning:**  I've already shown flexibility by lowering my offer twice. However, rejecting this offer reinforces my commitment to achieving a price closer to my value. It also keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his offer.
* **Next Steps:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to secure a price between $13,000 and $13,500.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and keep the negotiations moving towards a more favorable outcome for me.  This approach demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum acceptable value."
