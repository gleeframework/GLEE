"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range, considering the product's worth to him. This allows Bob to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. He is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, so accepting this offer means saving $2,500.  While further negotiation might be possible, it is not guaranteed and could risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
