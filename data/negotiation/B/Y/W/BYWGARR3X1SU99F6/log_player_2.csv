"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. Considering the product's unique features and long-term value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and presents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try to get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. Considering your previous offer and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
