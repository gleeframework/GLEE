"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous that Bob would immediately walk away. This leaves us the option to negotiate or still accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Seriousness:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 suggests he's seriously interested in the product. He's moved significantly from his perceived value ($1,000,000), indicating room for further negotiation.
* **Above John's Price:** While Bob's offer is below our initial ask, it's still more than John's guaranteed $1,200,000. We have the leverage to push for a better deal.
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2.  Rejecting now allows us to explore if Bob is willing to go higher without jeopardizing the negotiation significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. Considering the product's unique features and long-term value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and presents a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a substantial step down from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and John's price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the ""unique features and long-term value,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception closer to our desired price point.
* **Compromise Language:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. Considering your previous offer and the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches John's guaranteed price. There's no longer a financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob, as we risk him lowering his offer or walking away altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation introduces uncertainty and delays receiving payment. Accepting Bob's offer secures the deal now at a price equal to our alternative option. 
* **Potential for Complications:** While we could try to push Bob slightly higher, there's always a risk of jeopardizing the deal. It's often better to secure a good offer than to risk losing it for a marginally better one."
