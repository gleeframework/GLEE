"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but within a reasonable margin. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. 
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message is positive, highlighting the value to Bob and setting a collaborative tone. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I clearly express willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to secure a price as close as possible to my desired $1,750,000, while leaving space for negotiation and preventing an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I am confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

* **Reasoning:**  Selling to John would give me my minimum, but I have a chance to earn more with Bob.
* **Next steps:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and proposing a compromise that meets him halfway. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and emphasizing that my counteroffer is still fair.
* **Positive and Collaborative:** The message maintains a positive tone and encourages a mutually beneficial outcome. 

By offering a compromise that is closer to my desired price, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about $1,520,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,520,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to recognize that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Factor:** We're already on round 4, and it's important to secure a deal within a reasonable time frame.
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of a lower offer or rejection in later rounds. 

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision."
