"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet in the middle.",16500.0,Bob,4,
