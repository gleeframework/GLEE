Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,500, and you can buy the product from John for $8,000."
