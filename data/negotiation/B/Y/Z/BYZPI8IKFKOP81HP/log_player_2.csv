"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,200,000 for the product, that's $400,000 more than its value to me. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal from someone else.
