"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than our minimum acceptable price and even further from our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this is a fair and competitive offer considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're coming down in increments to signal flexibility but also holding firm above our $1,200,000 floor.  The message emphasizes the product's value proposition to justify the price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price. We'll continue negotiating strategically to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,675,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're making a smaller concession this round to signal we're getting closer to our bottom line. The message emphasizes this is a significant move on our part to encourage Bob to reciprocate. We're still aiming for above our $1,200,000 floor but recognizing the need to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on my assessment and budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $1,650,000. I hope this offer will be acceptable and allow us to proceed with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's latest offer of $1,650,000 is a substantial amount and significantly exceeds our fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000. While it's still below our initial ask, continuing to push for a higher price risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer represents a strong return and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
