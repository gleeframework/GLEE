I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1500000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you can work with.

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm not sure if we can reach an agreement.  If this fails, I'll be forced to buy from John."
