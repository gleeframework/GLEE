Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating your minimum, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the price is based on what you believe the product is worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob."
