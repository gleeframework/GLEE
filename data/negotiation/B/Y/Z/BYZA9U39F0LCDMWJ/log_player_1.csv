Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $1,500,000 because that's my minimum value for the product.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a significant difference between my minimum and Bob's maximum, allowing for negotiation.
* **Initial Offer:** By offering $1,750,000, I start with a high price, leaving room for compromise. I'm still well above my minimum and potentially within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations.
* I'll keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not enough:** While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting allows me to control the negotiations and potentially get closer to my desired price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my minimum, aiming for a price that is acceptable to both of us. 
* I'll be mindful of the fact that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob offered $1,400,000.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer of $1,550,000 is a compromise that splits the difference between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By offering a price slightly above my minimum, I show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal, while still keeping some room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I've successfully reached a compromise.
* If he rejects, I'll need to weigh my options. I can make another counteroffer, or accept his previous offer, or sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  There's very little room for negotiation left. Bob is unlikely to increase his offer much further.
* **Secure alternative:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is higher than anything Bob is willing to offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll sell the product to John and secure the best possible price for myself. 
* This maximizes my profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
