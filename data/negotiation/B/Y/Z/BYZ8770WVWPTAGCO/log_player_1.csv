"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit.  I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price he might be willing to negotiate down from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a higher price.  $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not giving up yet.  I'll try to negotiate a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is still a bit above what Bob initially offered, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will make him more likely to accept, but I'm also keeping my profit margin in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I'd ideally like to sell for closer to $100,  $95 is a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's always a chance Bob could get more stubborn, and with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth the gamble."
