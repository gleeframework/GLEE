"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $718000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can consider it.",718000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're making a final compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $718000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value to you warrants a higher price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $725000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to reconsider selling to you.",725000.0,Alice,7,
