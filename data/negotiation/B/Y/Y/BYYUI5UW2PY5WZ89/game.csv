"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go up to $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
