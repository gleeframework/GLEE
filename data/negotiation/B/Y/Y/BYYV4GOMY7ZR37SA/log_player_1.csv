"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for some give-and-take in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**  I aim to maximize my profit while also being open to negotiations. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Not giving up on Bob:**  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**  I'm playing a strategic game. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also showing that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $12,000 offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that even at $11,500, he's getting a good deal.
* **Setting a firm but fair price:**  $11,500 is a more reasonable price for both of us. It's closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed. 

**Strategy:** I'm taking a step towards Bob but not compromising too much. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's more advantageous for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product highly.

**Strategy:**  I'm taking a calculated risk.  Selling to John is always an option, but I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort in finding a solution.  $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,250?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small but significant increase:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm still holding firm but open to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" aspect of this price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using an encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept this offer and close the deal.

**Strategy:**  I'm inching closer to Bob's offer while still staying within my minimum range. The small increase shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal."
