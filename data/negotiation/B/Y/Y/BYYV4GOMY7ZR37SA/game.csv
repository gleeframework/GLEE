"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort in finding a solution.  $11000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11250?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,5,
