"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $11500? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $12250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
