"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $85 is still too low.  Let's try $95.  This is closer to your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about we try $87.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",87.5,Bob,6,
