Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120).
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm using the word ""fair"" to try to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Counter-offer with compromise:**  I'm proposing a price in the middle of our positions, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing finding a ""mutually agreeable price,""  making the deal seem like a win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I want to see if I can push for a bit more in the next round.  While selling to John is an option, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $85 is still too low.  Let's try $95.  This is closer to your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Understanding:** I acknowledge Bob's attempt to find a good deal, demonstrating empathy.
* **Counter with Gradual Increase:** I increase the price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Compromise Language:** I use phrases like ""meet you halfway"" to make the offer seem like a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about we try $87.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are approaching the end of our 10 rounds.  While Bob has moved a bit closer to my price, $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I don't want to risk losing out on a sure deal with John for a potential, but uncertain, gain from Bob. Therefore, I will sell to John for $120."
