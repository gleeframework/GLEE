"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This gives you a great deal and allows me to earn a bit more than selling it elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product and save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
