"I understand you're interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still trying to stay within your budget, but $13500 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal.

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $14500. It's a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're interested, let's do it.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really sorry, but I've already considered buying the product from another seller for $10000. I think that's the best deal I can get. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at $12500, or is that not possible?",12500.0,Bob,8,
