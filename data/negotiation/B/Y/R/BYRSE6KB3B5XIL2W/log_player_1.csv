Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and direct, stating the price clearly and indicating that I believe it's fair.  
* **John as a backup:**  Remembering that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence to negotiate confidently and potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm not going to accept his offer at this point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer.  While John is a backup, I'm still aiming to get closer to $1,200,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still below my desired price point. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,100,000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a good profit.
* **Message:**  I'm again being friendly and direct, acknowledging Bob's position while also restating my own. I'm framing this as a ""win-win"" situation. 
* **Still aiming higher:**  I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,050,000, but I'm also recognizing that a deal is more likely at this point compared to holding out for $1,150,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's latest offer is $1,075,000. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it's getting harder to negotiate further. 
* **Considering John:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 would only be a slightly better deal than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Making a deal:**  Since further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and may not yield a significantly higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision to secure a sale."
