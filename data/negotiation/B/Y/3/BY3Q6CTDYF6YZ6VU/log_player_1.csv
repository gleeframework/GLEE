Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always wise to aim higher initially. Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,500,000 allows space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. This increases the chances of securing a deal above the guaranteed price.
* **Confident and positive language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the investment. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes a certain level of risk tolerance. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice will still make a profitable sale to John, but she might miss out on a potentially higher profit."
