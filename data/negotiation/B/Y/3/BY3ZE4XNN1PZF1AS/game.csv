"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $18000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a fair price considering the product's unique value.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
