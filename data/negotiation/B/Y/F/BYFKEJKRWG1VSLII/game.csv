"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the product's true value is considerably higher. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
