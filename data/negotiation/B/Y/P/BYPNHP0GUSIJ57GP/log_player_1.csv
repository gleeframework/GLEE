"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I want to see if he's seriously interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $925,000 is a good price, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, we might get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers without reaching an agreement.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
