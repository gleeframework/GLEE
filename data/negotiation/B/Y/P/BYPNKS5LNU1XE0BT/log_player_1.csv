"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me and still leaves a good amount of value for Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from this starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counter with a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept it."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,080,000 is still a good amount, I'm hoping to get closer to $1,150,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,120,000.  This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still confident it's a fair price given Bob's value for the product. I believe this offer will be close enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,120,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, but if he continues to refuse, I'll have to start considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm reducing my offer to $1,100,000. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to the point where the potential gains are not worth the risk of further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging, and we're getting closer to the end of the rounds. My goal is to maximize my profit, and while $1,040,000 is still a decent amount, it's not worth risking another rejection with only a few rounds left. John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed sale, and I'm going to take it."
