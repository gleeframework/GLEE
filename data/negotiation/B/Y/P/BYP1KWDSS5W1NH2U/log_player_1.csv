"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, giving you room to lower it if needed. It also establishes a clear value proposition for Bob and encourages him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise and a fair price considering my minimum selling price.  Accepting this offer is better than selling to John for $10,000."
