"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and exploring possibilities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's clear that negotiation is needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to close this deal, but this is my maximum offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you've proposed doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,800,000 is still outside his budget. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
