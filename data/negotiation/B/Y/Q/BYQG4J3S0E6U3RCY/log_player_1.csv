Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is a significant way off from my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer. It's best to accept and secure the deal."
