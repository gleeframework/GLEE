"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Even if Alice is willing to sell at $150, there's a chance we can get it for less. Since we have 10 rounds, there's time to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're going for a significant discount (20%) right away. This shows Alice we're serious about saving money and might motivate her to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Counteroffer Explanation:**  We provide a reason for our counteroffer to make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's my final price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down to $130, which is a significant discount from her initial price of $150.  
* **Limited Time:** We have a limited number of rounds, and there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing her offer.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $150 is still an option, accepting Alice's offer at $130 saves us $20."
