"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, ideally under $120. Alice's initial offer of $180 is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob offers $130, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows he's serious about buying but also sets a clear lower limit.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but politely expresses that it's too high. It also highlights Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $155 is still above Bob's $120 limit.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob another chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob increases his offer slightly, showing that he is still interested, but staying within his budget constraints. He also encourages Alice to find a compromise.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes Bob's commitment to negotiation and suggests a middle ground."
