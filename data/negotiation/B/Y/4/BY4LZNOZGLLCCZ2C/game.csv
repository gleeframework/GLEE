"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer to my target. I'm willing to offer $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on, and it's a good compromise considering the value of the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,250? That's a fair price for me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. Let's close this deal! ",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once again.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to go up to $10,350. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll agree to it.  Let's close this deal!",10350.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300, which is a fair price that I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10300.0,Alice,9,
