"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great value considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and keeps us both reasonably happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target.  To avoid risking further negotiation and potential losses, I'll sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds with Bob."
