Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm still not quite getting to my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,055,000.

You can save $145,000 by accepting Alice's offer.  While you could make another counteroffer, Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  It's unlikely she will drop her price further, and there's a risk she will reject your counteroffer again.  Accepting her offer is the best strategy to maximize your savings and secure the product."
