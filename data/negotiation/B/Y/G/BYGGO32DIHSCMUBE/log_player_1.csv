"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but  I believe my initial offer is closer to reflecting the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for your specific needs.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. It seems we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers? I'd be willing to sell for $875,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $862,500. However, I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is attempting to anchor the price lower. However, his counteroffer suggests he's willing to move significantly. We're still well above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure we reach a deal that works well for both of us. Let's try this - $850,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and Bob is getting closer to our minimum price. Offering $850,000 keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving room for a final concession from Bob if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now at our absolute minimum price, and he's even threatening to go to our backup buyer.  While there's a small chance he might go slightly higher in the last two rounds, it's too risky to continue. We're guaranteed the same amount from John without further negotiation or risk of Bob walking away."
