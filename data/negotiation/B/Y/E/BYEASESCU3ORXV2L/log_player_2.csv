"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to purchase directly from John and save a considerable amount."
