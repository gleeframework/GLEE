{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product at.  You only know your minimum and that you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale ($15,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land in a profitable range. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he can get a deal while still leaving room for you to potentially secure a price above your minimum."
