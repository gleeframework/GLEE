"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
