"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe your product is of good quality, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
