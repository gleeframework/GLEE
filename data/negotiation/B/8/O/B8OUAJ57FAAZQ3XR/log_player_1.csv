Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 if you can sell to Bob above his valuation.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit. Here's the strategy:

1. **Start High, But Be Realistic:** Don't start at $1,500,000.  Begin with a price slightly below John's offer to create a sense of negotiation.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Anticipate that Bob might try to negotiate the price down.

**The Offer**

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss it further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It's below your guaranteed price from John.
