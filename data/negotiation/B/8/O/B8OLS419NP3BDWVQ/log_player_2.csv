"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for cheaper than $14,000 since Alice values it at $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

``` 
At $13,000, you're saving $2,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the full $15,000 to John. It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
