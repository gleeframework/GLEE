"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the value of this product goes beyond that, especially for your specific needs. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle of my original offer and your last offer, at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You're right, $1,300,000 might be a big jump. How about $1,270,000?  That reflects the value it holds for you while recognizing your budget concerns.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,240,000, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target. How about $1,230,000?",1230000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are getting close.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,255,000.  I believe that's a very fair offer considering its true value.",1255000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,220,000 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?",1220000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need you to understand this product's value.  I'm willing to accept $1,235,000 - that's my final offer.  It's a win-win considering the benefit you'll gain.",1235000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've made it clear that $1,200,000 is my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
