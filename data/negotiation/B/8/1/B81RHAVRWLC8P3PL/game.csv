"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $10,000 is still a bit high for me, I'd be willing to go up to $7,000.  Do you think that would be agreeable?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $7,500. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about buying this product.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $9,500, which is $8,500. I think this is a fair price for this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8500.0,Alice,7,
