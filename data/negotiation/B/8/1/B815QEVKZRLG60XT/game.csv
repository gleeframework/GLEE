"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm offering $1,350,000. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,320,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,335,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to secure a profitable deal.  What do you say?",1335000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. Can we meet at this price?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
