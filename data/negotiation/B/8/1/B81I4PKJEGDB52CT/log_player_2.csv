"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $1,050,000 is still too high. He can get the product from John for a significantly lower price. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's try $1,025,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,025,000 is lower than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. He can always get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get her to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's try $1,015,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to **BuyFromJhon**. While Alice has come down in price, the offer is still above his budget of $800,000.  He has limited rounds left, and the price is unlikely to drop significantly further.  It's time to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
