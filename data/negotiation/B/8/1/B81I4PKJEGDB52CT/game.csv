"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is still above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's try $1,025,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. Let's try $1,015,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
