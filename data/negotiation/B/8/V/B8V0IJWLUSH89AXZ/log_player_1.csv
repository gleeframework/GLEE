{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  I know you're interested in this product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer sets the bar high, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than my minimum:** $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Shows confidence:**  Offering a high price demonstrates that I believe in the value of my product and that I'm not desperate to sell it."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I want to try to get closer to my target of $950,000.  I will counter Bob's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both parties. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet at $900,000. I would like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum price of $800,000 and only $75,000 less than my initial offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I want to close the deal."
