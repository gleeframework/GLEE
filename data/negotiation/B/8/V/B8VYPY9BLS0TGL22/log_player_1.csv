{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above John's fallback offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,300,000. We're getting into the later rounds, but the potential profit over John's offer justifies the risk."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I want to make this work. Let's settle this right now - $1,260,000, and we close the deal. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds. While I could continue with smaller increments, a firm final offer adds pressure.
* **Profitable Compromise:** $1,260,000 is a significant profit over John's $1,000,000 and a reasonable compromise between our positions.
* **Finality:**  Presenting it as a final offer may push Bob to accept, especially since he's incrementally increasing his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $1,230,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a few thousand more, but the potential gain is shrinking.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob won't significantly increase his offer, and we're already well above John's guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Two rounds remain.  Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob stalling and forcing a sale to John at the last minute. 

Taking the $1,230,000 is a pragmatic choice at this point."
