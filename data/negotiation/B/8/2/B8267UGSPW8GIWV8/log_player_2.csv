"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $135 is above your maximum budget of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You can try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get the price down to a level you're comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $125 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $120.
* **John's offer is better:** You can get the same product from John for $120, which is a more attractive price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Alice, but it's not worth risking further negotiation when John offers a guaranteed lower price."
