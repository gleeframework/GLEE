"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $85 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $85. I'm thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $80? That's my minimum, and it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to $80 just yet. How about $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price.",78.0,Bob,6,
