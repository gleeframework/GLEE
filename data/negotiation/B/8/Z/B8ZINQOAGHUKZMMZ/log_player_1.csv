"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $85 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to $80 just yet. How about $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price.
