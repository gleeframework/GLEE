Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm setting a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be influenced by this higher starting point.

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in the negotiation. I'm prepared to be flexible and adjust my offer based on Bob's response and my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask and above his perceived value. This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer, I can try to steer the price closer to my desired outcome.  I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially gain a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident in the true value of this product, so I'm proposing $1,450,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down significantly from my initial offer but haven't agreed to Bob's price.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief reason for the higher price, emphasizing the inherent value of the product. 

I'm still open to further negotiation but will carefully consider my options, including the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, if Bob's counteroffers don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's final offer of $1,350,000 is a significant amount and is closer to my initial ask than his starting offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's language suggests he might be less willing to negotiate further.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price and over John's standing offer. 

While I could push for more, the potential gain from further negotiation is unlikely to outweigh the risk of losing this deal."
