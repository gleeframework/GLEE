Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $150 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.
*  Maximize my profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.
*  Leave room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
*  Have a safety net by being able to sell to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
