{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price of $150, giving you some room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's good to be flexible, accepting $80 would be a significant loss for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to be closer to $175.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  Even though it's a slight increase, it's still not in my range of acceptability.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's try $125.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough for me. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, which is a much better deal than what Bob is offering.  I'll sell to John."
