"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to be closer to $175.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's try $125.  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
