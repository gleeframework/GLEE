"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
