"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is a valuable asset for your business. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects its worth and provides you with a significant advantage. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still offers you a considerable benefit and is closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's still room to lower the price closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and is also closer to Bob's target price. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could continue negotiating, the difference between Alice's offer and his target is relatively small.  
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
