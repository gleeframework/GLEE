"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are trying to get the best deal possible, and $140 is still above your maximum price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget and a good deal. You're saving $15 compared to buying from John, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
