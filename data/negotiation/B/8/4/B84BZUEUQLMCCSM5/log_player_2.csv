{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and forces Alice to consider a lower price. It's unlikely she'll accept this offer immediately, but it's a good starting point to gauge her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for a better deal, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a more realistic price point that still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still $100,000 higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more time to negotiate a lower price. If I can't get closer to my target, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm increasing my offer to $1,400,000, which is only $100,000 less than Alice's last offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still pushing for a better deal. If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,550,000, it's still $50,000 over my budget.  I'm not willing to go any higher, and John offers the product at my maximum budget. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
