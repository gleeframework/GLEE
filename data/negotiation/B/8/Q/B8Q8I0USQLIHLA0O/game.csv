"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I see the value in this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about we settle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair price considering we both see the value in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, the product's worth is firmly above $1,150,000.  My final offer is $1,187,500. This reflects my best attempt to bridge the gap while respecting the product's value. ",1187500.0,Alice,5,
