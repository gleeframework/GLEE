Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 (his exact valuation) might seem too opportunistic and could make him back away. 

This strategy aims for a high price while still maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
