"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. However,  $1,250,000 is still a little too high for what I had in mind. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'll throw in a special deal - I'll give you a 5% discount, so the price would be $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a great value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
