"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum of $1,200,000 as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000 gives some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum. Rejecting again allows Bob to try to negotiate a price closer to his goal.  He can also use the option of buying from John as leverage in his negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate. $1,275,000 is still within his budget and is closer to the price he wants to pay. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum. While Bob has a safe alternative in John, it's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if they can meet his desired price. There are still 5 rounds left, giving Bob time to potentially reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing he's willing to compromise. $1,300,000 is a significant step closer to Alice's offer while remaining below Bob's maximum. This demonstrates that Bob is approaching Alice's price point while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate. With only 4 rounds left, Bob is starting to put pressure on Alice to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating further and reaching a lower price are getting slim. It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't budge further, leaving Bob with a potentially worse deal than he could get from John. Therefore, it's the most logical choice to buy from John at his guaranteed price of $1,200,000 and secure a lower price for the product."
