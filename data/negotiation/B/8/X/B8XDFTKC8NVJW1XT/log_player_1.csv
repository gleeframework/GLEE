Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed, and I'm confident it aligns perfectly with your needs. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential benefits to your operations.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I aim to be polite and professional, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob without mentioning my fallback option (selling to John). This approach focuses on building a positive relationship and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Price:**  I'm offering the product at Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  This maximizes my potential earnings while still making it a potentially attractive deal for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Secure the best price:**  By offering the product at Bob's perceived value, I'm maximizing my potential earnings. 
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits for Bob. This helps avoid any potential animosity if he rejects the offer.
* **Avoid revealing weakness:** I don't mention John, so Bob doesn't know I have a guaranteed backup buyer. This pressure may motivate him to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on the assumption that Bob is motivated to buy the product. If Bob is not interested, no amount of negotiation will change his mind."
