"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value we each place on it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $12,000 either. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement without compromising too much.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
