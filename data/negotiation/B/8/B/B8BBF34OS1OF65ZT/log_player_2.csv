Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is certainly a number we can discuss, it's significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects the value proposition and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
