"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm confident this price is fair considering the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the significant value this product brings.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
