"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have this valuable product for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $15,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John as a last resort."
