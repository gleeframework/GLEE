"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $90? It's a great product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",87.5,Bob,4,
