"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $975,000 is still a bit low for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
