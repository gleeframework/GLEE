"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
