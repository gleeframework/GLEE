"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for a negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $1,500,000 before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum and hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds, I'm still not desperate enough to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my price further to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above Bob's last offer and within my minimum acceptable range. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might finally convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is now well below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed offer from John. It's not ideal, but it's the best option given the circumstances."
