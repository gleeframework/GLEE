"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
