Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,250,000 is a good price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
