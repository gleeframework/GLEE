Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  Would you be willing to do $15,500? That's a significant reduction on my part."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  What if we split the difference between our last two offers and landed at $14,250?
