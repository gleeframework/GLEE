"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,300,000? It's a competitive offer that reflects the true worth of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
