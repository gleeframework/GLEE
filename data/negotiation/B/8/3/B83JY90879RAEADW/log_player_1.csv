Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get concerned about whether we'll be able to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go any lower than $8,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
