"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go any lower than $8,000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
