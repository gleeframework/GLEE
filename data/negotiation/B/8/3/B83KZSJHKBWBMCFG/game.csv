"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While I agree the product is unique, $750,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
