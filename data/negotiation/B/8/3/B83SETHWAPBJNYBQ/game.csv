"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire it at a lower price than its true worth. Let's talk!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a great deal on a product that will be valuable to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
