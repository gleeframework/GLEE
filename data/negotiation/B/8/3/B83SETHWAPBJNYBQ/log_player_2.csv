# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire it at a lower price than its true worth. Let's talk!
