"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't let it go for less than $9,000. This product is of exceptional quality and will bring you a lot of value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining with Alice and potentially get a better price."
