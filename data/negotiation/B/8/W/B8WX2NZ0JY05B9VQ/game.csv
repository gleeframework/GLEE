"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
