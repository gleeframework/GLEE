Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to either accept a slightly lower price or make a counteroffer of your own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to my desired outcome than John's offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not sure if he's willing to negotiate further. To avoid risking a further decrease in price, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a guaranteed sale and more than my minimum acceptable price."
