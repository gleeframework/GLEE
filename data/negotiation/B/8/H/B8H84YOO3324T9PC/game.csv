"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $20,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is way too high for me. I think a more reasonable offer would be closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $10,000 is a more reasonable price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $13,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $14,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's the best I can do.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford. I can go up to $12,000.  Take it or leave it.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product.",14000.0,Alice,7,
