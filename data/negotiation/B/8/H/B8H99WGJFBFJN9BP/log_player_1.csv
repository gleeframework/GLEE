"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm also being open to Bob's feedback. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a high initial price to maximize my profit potential.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to avoid immediately pushing Bob away. 
* I'm also keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John at that price guarantees me a profit.  

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  I need to push for a higher price.  Rejection allows me to counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John is always a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I need to get closer to my asking price to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but is closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product.  I'm framing this as a compromise that benefits both of us. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $1,400,000 is still a good price for me, and I'm not giving in too quickly. 
* **Avoiding John:**  If Bob accepts, I can avoid selling to John and potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose an additional condition: if you can throw in some additional support or services with the product, I'd be willing to meet you at $1,250,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hesitant to agree to his condition of additional support or services. Offering extra services could be costly or time-consuming, potentially impacting my overall profit. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price without adding extra commitments.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Control:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and avoid being pressured into unwanted concessions.
* **Focusing on Price:** I want to prioritize maximizing the purchase price and avoid introducing unnecessary complexities.
* **Maintaining John Option:** Selling to John remains a secure backup option if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the willingness to move closer on the price. However, I'm not comfortable adding additional support or services at this point.  I understand your perspective on the value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a fair agreement without requiring extra commitments."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,325,000, which is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,250,000.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and his desire for additional support but firmly stating my position of not wanting to add extra services. I'm framing this as a fair compromise that addresses both of our needs. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** By offering a compromise price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a price that is closer to my desired range.
* **Staying Firm on Services:** I'm avoiding unnecessary commitments and maintaining control over the negotiation.
* **Maintaining John Option:**  Selling to John is still a viable option if the deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, I've reached a stalemate in the negotiation.  To guarantee my desired profit, I'll choose to sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John secures my desired profit of $1,500,000, ensuring a positive outcome.
* **Limited Time:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and further negotiation with Bob may not yield a better result.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of further price reductions or potential complications with Bob."
