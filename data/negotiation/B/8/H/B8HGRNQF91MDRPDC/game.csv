"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $1,210,000.  This is my final offer.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
