"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! I have another buyer lined up if you decline, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and he has the option to buy it from John for the same price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with another seller or wait for a better opportunity."
