"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000. Considering the exceptional quality and unique features of this product, I am offering it to you for $14,000. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, aiming to provide you with the best possible value while ensuring a fair transaction for us. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
