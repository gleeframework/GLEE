"I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10500. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but that's as high as I can go. If not, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
