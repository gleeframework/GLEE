{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You don't know how much she's willing to go down, and you have room to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if she's willing to compromise."

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close, and you're only $20,000 away from your target price. There's a high chance that Alice won't budge further, and you could end up paying more if you keep rejecting her offers. It's more advantageous to accept the current offer and secure the product."
