{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great value at this price, and I'm excited to see if it's the right fit for you."",

}
``` 
  
I'm starting the negotiation at a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This tactic allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I know I can get at least $150 from John, so I'll counter-offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $200 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", 
 ""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't accept a low offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below both my asking price and my minimum. Accepting would be leaving money on the table.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Coming down from $200 to $160 demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reinforcing the product's value to nudge Bob towards a higher price. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is moving closer to my range, $120 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a sure $150. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit than to continue negotiating with Bob, risking a lower final price or a failed negotiation.

It's been a pleasure negotiating with Bob, but sometimes the best business decision is to walk away when an offer doesn't meet your needs."
