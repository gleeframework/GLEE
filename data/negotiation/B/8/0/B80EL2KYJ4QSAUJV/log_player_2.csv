"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to Alice's value, Bob can still get a better price. He has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is important to me, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer.  How about $1,150,000? This is a significant price point for me, but I believe it still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as his maximum price is $1,000,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers and Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a price lower than his ceiling."
