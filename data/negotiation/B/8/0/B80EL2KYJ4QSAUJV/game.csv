"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is important to me, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my original offer.  How about $1,150,000? This is a significant price point for me, but I believe it still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
