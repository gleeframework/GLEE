"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $150 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and my need to recover costs. Would you be open to discussing this further? Considering the value it brings, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor your perception of the product's value at $150, even though you have a maximum budget in mind. Her offer of $140 is still above your psychological limit and leaves little room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she's willing to come down further. If not, you can always buy from John at your maximum price."
