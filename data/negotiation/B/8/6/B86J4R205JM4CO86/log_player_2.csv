"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  While it's worth a minimum of $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant opportunity for both of us, allowing me to maximize my return and you to secure a product that holds even greater value for your needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
