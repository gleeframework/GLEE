"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to what it's worth to him, and I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with a price of $12,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,500? That would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I propose $13,000 for your product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal, considering it's only $500 less than my initial offer and significantly more than selling to John. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and maximize my profits."
