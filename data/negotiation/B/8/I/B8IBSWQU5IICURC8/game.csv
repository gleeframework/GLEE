"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $1,750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. How about offering the product at $1,400,000? This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is truly exceptional and holds a significant value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1,550,000. It's a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
