Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** A price of $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can negotiate down towards his perceived value of $10,000. You have a buffer to work with, ensuring you never go below your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. However, be prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's beneficial for you. You already have a secured sale with John."
