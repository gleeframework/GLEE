{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150, giving you some wiggle room to potentially get closer to your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  Would you be willing to settle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $100 is right at my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and it allows me to close the deal."
