"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair deal for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be reasonable.  How about $11,200? That's a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for the product.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",10800.0,Bob,6,
