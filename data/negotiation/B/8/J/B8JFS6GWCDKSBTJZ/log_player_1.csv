Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, a price that reflects its value and my commitment to a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair deal for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I need to get at least $11,000 to make a fair profit.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be reasonable.  How about $11,200? That's a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum price of $11,000. At this point, I've been negotiating for a while and I'm confident that I can secure the $12,000 from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
