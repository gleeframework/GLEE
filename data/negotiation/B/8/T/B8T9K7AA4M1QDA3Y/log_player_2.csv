# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than her stated value, it's still considerably higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can aim for a price closer to your budget or simply purchase it from John for a guaranteed saving."
