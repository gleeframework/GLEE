Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high leaves space for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable deal.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to your own. By starting high, you might:

* **Get lucky:** Bob might accept the offer outright.
* **Negotiate down:**  You can gradually lower the price during negotiations,  staying well above your minimum. 
 
**Important:** This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate and that a quick sale to John isn't your absolute priority."
