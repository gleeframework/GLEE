{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:** Emphasizing my willingness to discuss a fair price shows I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Strategic First Offer:** This offer gives Bob a clear starting point and sets the stage for a potential counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider:

* **His counteroffer:** If it's close to my minimum, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I might be willing to sell to John for the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am only able to pay up to $85 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a higher price by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Having John's offer of $100 gives me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob, knowing I have a fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll continue to monitor John's availability in case the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget constraint, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $92.50 is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($85). 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value Bob will receive by purchasing the product, aiming to make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Next Steps:**

I will closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider if I want to make another counteroffer or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, but I'm still not able to meet at $92.5. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try to counter again, there's a chance Bob will become less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time and opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate might take time and potentially lose me the opportunity to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $90. This ensures a quick and relatively positive outcome, considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
