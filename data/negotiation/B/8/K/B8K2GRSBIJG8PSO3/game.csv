"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can do $140, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, considering the product's value is at least $120 to me.",140.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can come to an agreement within my budget. Could you consider $130? This would allow us to both reach a satisfactory solution.",130.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I can do $145, which is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",145.0,Alice,5,,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I really appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $140?",140.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,145.0
"I'm not willing to go back to $140, Bob. I've already offered you $145, and I'm not budging from that price. If you're not willing to meet me at $145, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm still open to negotiating, but I need to get at least this price for the product.",145.0,Alice,7,,
