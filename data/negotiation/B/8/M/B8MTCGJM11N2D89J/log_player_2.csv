"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice has lowered her price to $11,500. There's still a gap, and Bob can try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering your lower limit, and we can both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product at the lowest possible price. Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will refuse to go lower and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the best option for Bob to get the product at a good price."
