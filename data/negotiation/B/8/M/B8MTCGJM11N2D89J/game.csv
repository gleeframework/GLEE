"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering your lower limit, and we can both close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
