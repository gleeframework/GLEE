"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
