"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and value to potentially entice Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not outrageously high, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm aware that if I don't make a deal with Bob, I can sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob.
* I'll be monitoring Bob's responses closely. If he seems hesitant or counteroffers too low, I'll be ready to either make a counter-offer or cut the deal short and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I can only go up to $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to warrant accepting it.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.** I have several rounds left, and there's still an opportunity to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be sending a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, attempting to bridge the gap between our positions."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to this deal.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce my position.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""opportunity"" this represents for Bob, appealing to his potential gain. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to budge further.  
* If he rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my strategy for the remaining rounds.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John in mind, but I'm still hopeful of securing a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).** While it's closer to my target, I'm not yet willing to accept it. 
* **I want to try one more counteroffer.** There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is still a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.**

**Next Steps:**

I'll be sending a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll need to be strategic and consider how much I'm willing to concede without jeopardizing my bottom line."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum, considering the unique value of this product. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating this is my final offer to emphasize the urgency and create pressure on Bob.
* **Minimum Price:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, which is still above what Bob is offering, but shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **High Stakes:** This round is crucial. If Bob rejects, I'll likely have to accept John's offer to avoid losing too much.
* **No More Concessions:** I've reached my absolute minimum. Any further concessions would be detrimental to my profit.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm weighing the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the potential gains of getting my minimum price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).**  I've already reached my absolute minimum in the previous round.
* **We are nearing the end of the negotiation process.**  I have limited rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing any more time. 
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price.** This is a safe and secure option that ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of profit.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Time is of the essence.** I need to make a decision quickly and decisively.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is high, and the potential reward is relatively low. 
* **John's offer provides stability and certainty.**  This is the most sensible option considering the current situation."
