{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $95 is still a significant amount above your ideal price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer of $85 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer of $95.  It's still within my budget, but it's a strong signal that I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Room for compromise:**  I believe there's still room for Alice to come down a bit.  I'm aiming for a price closer to her own valuation of $80, but I'm willing to pay a little more to secure the deal.
* **Staying within my budget:**  This offer keeps me within my $120 limit while still giving me a good deal."
