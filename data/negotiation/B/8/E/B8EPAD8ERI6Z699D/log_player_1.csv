Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
