"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you think it's worth $8,500 to you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,800?  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to make a reasonable deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
