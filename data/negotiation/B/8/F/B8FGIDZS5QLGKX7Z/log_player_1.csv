"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you.  I believe its true value is significant and will greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I propose an initial price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than both our valuations, we establish a strong initial position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This high initial offer will help us understand Bob's eagerness and willingness to negotiate. His response will give us valuable information for the subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the safety net of John's offer at $1,500,000. This knowledge allows us to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his valuation and our minimum acceptable price, it leaves no room for us to make a profit.  We still have eight rounds of negotiation, and by rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we value the product higher. This sets the stage for a potential compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  I believe my initial price is closer to reflecting the product's true worth and long-term potential.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've made a substantial reduction from our initial offer, signaling to Bob that we are willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still significantly above both our minimum and Bob's offer, giving us room for further negotiation while aiming for a price that yields a profit.
* **Justification:** We subtly reassert our belief in the product's higher value, potentially influencing Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,850,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,725,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his interest in the product.  However, we are still in the early stages of negotiation. Rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer slightly above our minimum allows us to gauge his willingness to move closer to our desired price point. We have time on our side and the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of compromise, I can offer the product for $1,775,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concessions:** We are making smaller concessions now, signaling that we are nearing our bottom line. This tactic maintains negotiating pressure on Bob.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By suggesting this price, we're aiming for a point slightly above the midpoint between his last offer and our previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise but holds firm to a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** We continue to emphasize a collaborative approach and highlight the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his lowest price, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless and could risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the uncertainty and potential delays of continued negotiation. There's no guarantee we could get a better offer from Bob."
