Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm stating that I'm open to hear Bob's thoughts, which implies a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy allows for a potential win-win situation where I can maximize my earnings while still potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
