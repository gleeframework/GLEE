"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows for a counteroffer to potentially save more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives me another chance to drive the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This allows for a good profit for you and gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John and represents a good deal for both of us.  Further negotiation is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better price."
