"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
