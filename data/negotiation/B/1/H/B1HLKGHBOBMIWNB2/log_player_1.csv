""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands. I'm willing to make a deal today for $925,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Bob values the product highly, so starting near his valuation ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""make a deal today"" encourages a quicker decision from Bob."
