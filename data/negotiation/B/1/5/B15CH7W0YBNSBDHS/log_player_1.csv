"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I still have time to negotiate with Bob, and hopefully, I can reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I hope this shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round. There's a chance that Bob is getting more serious and will increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for too much less than what I think the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer.  If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to sell to John and ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob at $11,500.  This is a small increase from my last offer, and it shows Bob I'm willing to compromise. However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
