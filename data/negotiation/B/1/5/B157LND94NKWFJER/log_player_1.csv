Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offering $1,100,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). It leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for me. 
* **Why not go higher?** A higher offer might scare Bob off, and he might reject it outright.  
* **Why not go lower?**  A lower offer might make me lose out on potential profit, and it might lead to a long and drawn-out negotiation that could end with me having to accept a price closer to Bob's value. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider Bob's response and his potential counter-offers. 
* I will always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  
* **Reason for Rejection:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Why not sell to John now?**  Even though selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't allow me to potentially earn more.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I will try to find a price that is both appealing to Bob and still profitable for me.
* I will carefully consider Bob's potential counteroffers and be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering at $1,000,000:**  This price is a compromise between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  It's a fair middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a price that's too low. 
* **Why not go higher?** I want to avoid scaring Bob away and potentially breaking off negotiations. 
* **Why not go lower?** Lowering my offer further might make me appear desperate and could lead to a lower final price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider Bob's response and his potential counteroffers. 
* I will always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.

* **Why not sell to John now?** Even though selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't allow me to potentially earn more.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering at $975,000:**  This price is a compromise between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my value. 
* **Why not go higher?** I want to avoid scaring Bob away and potentially breaking off negotiations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  While I'm not thrilled about selling for $1,200,000, it's a significant amount and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Reason for Selling:**  The negotiation with Bob seems to be at a stalemate.  He's unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not willing to lower my price below $975,000.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate will only lead to a lower price for me.  

**Why not continue negotiating?**  I've already made several concessions. Continuing the negotiation could lead to further concessions, which I'm unwilling to make at this point.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay a fair price."
