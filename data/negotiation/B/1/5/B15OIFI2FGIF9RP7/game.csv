"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! However, I'm still a bit above your $7,000 offer. I'm willing to compromise at $8,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
