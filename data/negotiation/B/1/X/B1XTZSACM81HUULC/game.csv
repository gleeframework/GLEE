"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we discuss it at $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob. I believe we can find a middle ground here. How about we consider the product priced at $135? I think this would be a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence. I understand your position, and I'm willing to go down to $130 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering its value to both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can finally close the deal.",128.0,Bob,6,
