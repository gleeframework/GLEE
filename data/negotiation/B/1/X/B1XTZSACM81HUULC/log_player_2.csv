"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we discuss it at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under $120.  Alice's initial offer of $140 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. I believe we can find a middle ground here. How about we consider the product priced at $135? I think this would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum budget of $120. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if they can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence. I understand your position, and I'm willing to go down to $130 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for under $120. While $130 is closer to his target than previous offers, he should continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to lower the price further.  He still has time and can always buy from John for $120 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point. Let's see if we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 128}
