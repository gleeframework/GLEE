We're now deep into the negotiation, and Alice is consistently moving towards our desired price range. While we could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming smaller, and we risk jeopardizing the deal. Accepting at $662,500 secures a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer."
