"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I can't go as low as $9,500 but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit closer to your price, but $9,800 is still not enough for me. Let's split the difference, how about $10,150? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,150. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I understand your position, but $9,900 is still a bit low for me. Let's make a final compromise. How about $10,000? It's my minimum, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
