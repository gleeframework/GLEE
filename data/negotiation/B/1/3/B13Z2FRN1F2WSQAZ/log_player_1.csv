Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a price of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **""First refusal"" tactic:**  By phrasing it as a priority offer, I create a subtle sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message's tone is open to discussion, suggesting I might be willing to lower the price slightly depending on Bob's response.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously. If he rejects it, I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John."
