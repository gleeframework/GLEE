"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $2,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,950,000. Can you consider that?",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000, but that's my absolute best offer.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. However, $2,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. Can you consider that?",1900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I need to be upfront with you.  I have another buyer who's ready to close the deal at a higher price.  To be fair to you, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,550,000. This is non-negotiable, and I need your decision by tomorrow.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the urgency, Alice, but I'm not ready to commit to $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. Can you reconsider?",1450000.0,Bob,8,
