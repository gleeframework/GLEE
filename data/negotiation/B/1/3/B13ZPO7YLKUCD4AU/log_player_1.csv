"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. It's a high-quality product worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $1,500,000.  I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a significant value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price and is the same as what John is offering. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation and risking a lower offer from Bob or a change of heart from John.  It's time to close the deal."
