I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're running out of time, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which meets my minimum and gives me a good profit.  It's not ideal, but it's the most sensible choice given the limited rounds left."
