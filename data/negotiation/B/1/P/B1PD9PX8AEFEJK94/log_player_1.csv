Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high a gap from my position. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price.  I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
