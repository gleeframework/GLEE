"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high a gap from my position. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant value for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
