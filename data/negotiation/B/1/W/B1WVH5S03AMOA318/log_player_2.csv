# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price ($120) is lower than your maximum budget ($150).**  
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though Alice's price is higher than her value of the product ($100), it's still a good deal for you."
