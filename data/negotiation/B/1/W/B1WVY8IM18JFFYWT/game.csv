"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about we consider $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
