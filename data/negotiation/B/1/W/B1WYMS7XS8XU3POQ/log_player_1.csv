"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium right away, and if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to be flexible while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer again and continue to negotiate for a better price. While I could sell to John now for $1,000,000, I believe I can potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,025,000. I'm narrowing the gap again, but this time I'm keeping the price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm still a bit disappointed I couldn't get closer to my ideal price with Bob, it's getting very close to the end of the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
