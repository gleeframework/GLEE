{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer hasn't changed and it's too low. I've made several concessions, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge. It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I want to avoid the risk of losing too much money. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a better profit than accepting Bob's offer."
