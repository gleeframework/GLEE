"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little rich for me though.  Could you meet me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
