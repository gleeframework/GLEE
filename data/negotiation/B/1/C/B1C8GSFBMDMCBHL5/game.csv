"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a final push, so I'll offer $925,000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm really interested in making a deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
