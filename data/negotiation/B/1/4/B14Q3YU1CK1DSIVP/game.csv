"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $15000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Bob,2,
