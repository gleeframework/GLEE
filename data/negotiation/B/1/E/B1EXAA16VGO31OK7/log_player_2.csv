"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's a significant discount from Alice's original offer and still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. However, it's significantly closer to his target price than John's offer. Since there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, it makes sense for Bob to accept this offer and save $500 compared to buying from John."
