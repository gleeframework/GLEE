"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  I believe we can reach an agreement if we both show a little flexibility.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
