"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Strong Opening:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and presenting a ""fair"" price to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I expect Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me more leverage in negotiations.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob creates a chance for compromise.
* **Avoid wasting time:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can quickly move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and push the price higher. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value and presenting it as a win-win for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""make this work"" to subtly suggest a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep negotiations moving:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the dialogue open and showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Close the gap:**  The counteroffer bridges the price gap, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  I believe we can reach an agreement if we both show a little flexibility."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm encouraging Bob to consider his own flexibility and willingness to compromise. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  By consistently counteroffering, I'm demonstrating my willingness to find a solution.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired profit, while also showing flexibility.
* **Increase the likelihood of an agreement:**  By suggesting a middle ground, I'm making it easier for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time, and Bob keeps pushing for a price that is too low for me.  I've already made several compromises, and it seems like he is unwilling to budge. At this point, it's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  While this isn't my ideal price, it ensures I meet my minimum acceptable profit and doesn't risk losing even more money with continued negotiations."
