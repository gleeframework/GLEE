"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair price to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've invested a lot of time and effort into it, and I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute best offer is $10,250. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Bob,6,
