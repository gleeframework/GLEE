Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than John's offer, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to reject and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,800,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but a step down from my initial price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, showing a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my belief of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's only $100,000 less than John's offer.  Given the back-and-forth and the risk of further negotiation, it seems like a good time to accept.  I'm secure in my minimum value, and it's unlikely Bob will go higher."
