Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $15,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. Could you consider a price of $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Could you consider a price of $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum price than John's standing offer of $12,000. It makes sense to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk losing Bob as a buyer by pushing for a smaller increase.
