Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's value of $100 but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to counter. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a benchmark if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his initial offer of $105, but still lower than my starting price of $115.
* **Compromise:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Value Proposition:** I remind Bob that my offer is still a good deal for him, even with the price increase.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable value of $120, so I still have some leverage if Bob rejects my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, and is now offering the same price as his first offer, $105.
* **No Room for Compromise:** I'm not willing to lower my price further, as it would be below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  I know that John is willing to buy the product for $120. 

It's more advantageous to sell the product to John and guarantee a profit of $20 rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
