``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can work out a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? That would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,500 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counter again to try and reach a deal that's fair for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm happy to come down to $8,000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
