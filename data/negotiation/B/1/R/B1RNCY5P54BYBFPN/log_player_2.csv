The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $120. This means there is room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

While $125 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get it for less. I'll try one more counteroffer before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $128, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $129.50

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but she is still asking for more than I am willing to pay.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $150.  It's more than I wanted to spend, but it's still a better deal than what Alice is currently offering."
