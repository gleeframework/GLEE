"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,200, so I'll offer $9,850. Can you consider that?",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,850. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $10,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10100.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,700, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",9700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,700. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,050. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better offer. I'll make one final offer: $9,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
