Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential for you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is much higher than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your $800,000 safety net with John.
* **Strong but Fair Justification:**  The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to entice Bob.  Mentioning the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds him of the product's worth. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal significantly higher than your minimum while acknowledging Bob's stronger position as the more motivated buyer."
