{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's target. He's only got one more round to negotiate, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to his desired price. Since John offers the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the best option."
