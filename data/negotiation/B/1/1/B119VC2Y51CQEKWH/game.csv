"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable for you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. However, I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still recognizing your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
