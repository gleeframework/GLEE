{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but still gives me a decent profit. I'm starting with a high price, hoping to leave some room for negotiation if necessary. I'm also being friendly and direct to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is too low for me. While it's better than selling to John for $150, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to drop my price to $105. This is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us. If you accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 105}
