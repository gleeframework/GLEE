Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
