"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make a responsible decision. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
