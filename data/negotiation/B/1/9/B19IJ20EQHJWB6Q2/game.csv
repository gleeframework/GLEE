"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
