"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to purchase the item.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  While $90 is a good price, I'm not able to go that low right now.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves some profit for me, and hopefully, it works within your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $88? I believe this would still allow us to reach a fair agreement.",88.0,Bob,4,
