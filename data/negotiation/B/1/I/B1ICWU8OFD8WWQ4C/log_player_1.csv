Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to assess Bob's interest and potential for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while allowing me to purchase the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You can try to get closer to your goal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  While $90 is a good price, I'm not able to go that low right now.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves some profit for me, and hopefully, it works within your budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $88? I believe this would still allow us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $88 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $120, securing a better profit."
