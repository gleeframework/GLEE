Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay a little more.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
