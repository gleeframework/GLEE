"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to discussing further if you're interested.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a win-win scenario.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works.",950000.0,Bob,4,
