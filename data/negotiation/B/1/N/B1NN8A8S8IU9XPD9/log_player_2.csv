Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is far above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a win-win scenario. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price."

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 950000}
