I'm starting with a price of $180, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $130, as that's below my minimum. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering $160, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this is a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob is still below my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  John is offering my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
