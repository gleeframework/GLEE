The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice's offer is $180. This is way too much for me. I will reject her offer and try to counteroffer."

I'm offering Alice $130 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to me and I'm willing to pay a slight premium."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is what John is selling it for. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $145. This is a compromise, closer to her price but still within my budget. I'm hopeful she'll accept this offer."
