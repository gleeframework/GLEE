"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to consider buying it for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $10800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10600.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10700 is a good price, I'm still holding out for $10650.

"Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your patience. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low.
