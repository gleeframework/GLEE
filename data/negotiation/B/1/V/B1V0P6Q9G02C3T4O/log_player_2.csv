"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you might be different. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. I believe this offers a fair compromise between its value to me and its perceived value to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making an offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and what John is offering.  By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or simply proceeding to buy from John at a price that works best for you."
