"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $700000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To start, I'd like to offer $500000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to be flexible. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $600000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go to $550000.  Let's keep moving towards a deal that works for both of us.",550000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $580000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a great value. What do you think?",580000.0,Alice,5,
