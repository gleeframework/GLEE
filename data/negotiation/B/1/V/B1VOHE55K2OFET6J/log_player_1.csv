Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. Given my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While $1,325,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $1,350,000. It's too early to settle for John's offer."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're making an effort to compromise, Alice. I appreciate that. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,320,000. I hope this offers a reasonable solution for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally approaching our price point. We are getting close, and it is unlikely he will walk away now. We have room to counter, and it's still worth aiming for a slightly higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal – I'm willing to accept $1,325,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're in the latter half of the negotiation rounds. It's time to signal firmness and set a clear boundary. By stating it's our final offer, we add weight to the offer, hoping Bob will accept. It's still a good profit margin above our minimum, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
