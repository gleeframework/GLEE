"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal, and I'll be able to get closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,
