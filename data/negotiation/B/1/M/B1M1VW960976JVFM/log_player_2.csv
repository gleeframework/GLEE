"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $950,000 for it. This offer takes into account the significant investment you're making and aims to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He has a good buffer with his $1,200,000 limit and can use the negotiation process to try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $900,000 for the product. This offer still reflects the value of the product while providing a reasonable profit margin. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  He's still well within his budget and there's room for more negotiation.  It's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit more to secure the deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $895,000 as the final price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects the value you see in the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's successfully negotiated the price down significantly from the initial $950,000, and it's only $12,500 more than his last counteroffer.  Trying to negotiate further is unlikely to save him much more money, and risks losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 would be far more expensive."
