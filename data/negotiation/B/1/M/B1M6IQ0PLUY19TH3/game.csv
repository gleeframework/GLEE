"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
