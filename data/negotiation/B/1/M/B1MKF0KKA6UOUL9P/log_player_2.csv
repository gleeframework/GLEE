"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product for $800,000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below the product's value to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000).  This suggests there is room for negotiation and potential for a better deal.  It's worth exploring those options before buying from John at the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 feels quite low considering the product's value. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant benefit the product will bring to my business, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  The counter-offer of $1,000,000 is still lower than John's price but closer to Alice's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justified price:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the offer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Alice. 
* **Strategic approach:** This approach avoids a drastic counter-offer that might alienate Alice and helps establish a starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. We believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and we're open to further discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $800,000, and it's getting closer to the value you're willing to pay. This offer represents a good compromise, allowing you to save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the chance of squeezing out an even better deal, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially ending up paying John's full price outweighs the potential gain."
