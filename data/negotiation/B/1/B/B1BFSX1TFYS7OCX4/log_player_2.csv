Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price reflects the value and potential this product holds for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this deal. Let's bridge the gap. To show my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" of $1,200,000 is still higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge, and you'll end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you know is acceptable from John."
