Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to me. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
