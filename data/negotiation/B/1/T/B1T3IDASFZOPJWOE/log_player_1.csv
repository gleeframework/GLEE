Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $130 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately triggering my backup plan (selling to John).
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than his initial value assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe there's room to negotiate further and get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $150 is my backup, but I want to explore the possibility of a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $130 to $120, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to emphasize a mutually beneficial outcome and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm getting closer to my acceptable price range, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $115. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gain is minimal. 
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and I'm running the risk that Bob will continue to haggle, potentially delaying a sale.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a secure profit and eliminates any further risk of a lower price."
