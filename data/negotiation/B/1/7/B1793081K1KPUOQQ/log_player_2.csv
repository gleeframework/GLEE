"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth exactly that to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that the product is worth $12,000 to me, her current offer doesn't save me any money. There's no incentive to accept her offer immediately. By rejecting it, I open the possibility of her lowering the price in a counter-offer to secure the sale.  If she doesn't, I can always buy from John at the same price."
