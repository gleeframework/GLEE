"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for improvement.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to pay $12,500. I'll try to negotiate a bit lower in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. It's still a better deal than buying from John, and there's still some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which would be a good deal for both of us.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
