"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant profit for me and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to signal that I'm open to discussing the price. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware of John's $10,000 offer, so I need to ensure I don't drop below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price:** While $11,500 is better than John's offer, it's still below my $10,000 floor. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better price. 
* **Avoiding a quick deal:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize the value and deal:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""confident you'll be happy"" to create a positive tone and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintain negotiation pressure:** I'm not simply accepting his offer, showing that I'm still trying to achieve a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which would be a good deal for both of us.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is within my acceptable range:**  $12,000 is above my minimum of $10,000 and a good profit for me.
* **Limited time and negotiation rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the potential for further negotiation. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting, I risk losing Bob as a buyer, leaving me with only John's offer, which is less favorable.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a deal and avoid the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
