Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's something I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business.  My starting price is $1,150,000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits the product could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant discount. It's better to try to negotiate a more reasonable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price still allows you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's a good compromise and securing the deal is important. Selling to John would give me a lower price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing both buyers."
