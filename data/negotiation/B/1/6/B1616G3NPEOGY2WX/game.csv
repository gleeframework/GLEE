"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to move a little on my price, how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $1,025,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
