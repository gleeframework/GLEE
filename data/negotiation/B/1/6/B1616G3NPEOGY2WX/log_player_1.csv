**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your desired outcome.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed offer rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
