"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, leaving the door open for Bob to counter.

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to budge from his initial valuation. 
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I need to make at least $150, so $125 is unacceptable.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us. 
* **John is a backup:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not desperate. I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not undervalue the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'd accept $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Specificity:** I'm not just throwing out another number; I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer (splitting the difference). 

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* If he rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and determine whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $127.50 is still below my minimum of $150. While it's closer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me.
* **Opportunity for another counteroffer:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested and willing to compromise. 
* **John is a safe fallback:**  I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer as I can sell to John for $150.

**Strategy:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a reasonable range. 
* I'll use this counteroffer to gauge Bob's true willingness to negotiate. If he's unwilling to budge, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. Let's make one last attempt to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $132.50, which is closer to your offer and still gives me a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final offer before potentially selling to John. This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Fair Price:** I reiterate my desire to find a price that's fair for both of us. This helps to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Number:** $132.50 is a specific and slightly unconventional price that might feel like a more significant compromise to Bob, potentially increasing his likelihood of accepting.

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway in this final offer. 
* If he rejects, I'm likely to sell to John in the next round as I've reached the limit of my negotiation range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $132.50, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $129.25. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob has come closer, his offer of $129.25 is still significantly below my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield desired price:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my desired minimum and significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid further negotiations that are unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome."
