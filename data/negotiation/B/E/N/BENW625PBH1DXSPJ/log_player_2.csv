"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least that much to me and you've indicated it's worth that much to you as well. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice is trying to bluff you into paying more. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to accept a higher price."
