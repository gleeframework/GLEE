"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm a savvy buyer and I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to make a serious offer on this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I can offer it to you for $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. I'm also starting to consider other options, so I'd like to move forward with a more serious offer.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to move forward with a more serious offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10200. I'm willing to pay $9600 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price by now, I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, but I need to know if that's something you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're trying to make a final push, but I'm still not willing to pay $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $9800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,10,
