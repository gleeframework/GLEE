Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $10,000 because it's too low. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
