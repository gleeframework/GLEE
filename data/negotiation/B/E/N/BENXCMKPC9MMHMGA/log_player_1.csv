Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still too low.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, it's not worth it to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
