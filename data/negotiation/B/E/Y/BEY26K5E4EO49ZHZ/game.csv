"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product, and I'm excited to share it with you. I believe you'll find it very interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. I believe this price reflects the product's value to both of us and will allow us to close the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from here. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal!",1285000.0,Alice,5,
