Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement. It's important to start high, as Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum price. This allows for potential compromise and a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a higher price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, lowering the price slightly from your initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a price point that's closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly lower than what I'd ideally like, but it's still higher than selling to John.  This deal secures a decent profit, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price, especially as Bob has already lowered his offer twice."
