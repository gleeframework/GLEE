Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I want to avoid immediately going to John for $1,000,000, as I might be able to get a bit more from Bob.
* **Open communication:**  I'm being open and transparent in my communication, hoping to foster a more cooperative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's room for a compromise.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer, I might be able to get closer to my target price or even convince him to pay more.

I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** By offering $800,000, I'm showing flexibility while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $800,000, the product is still a good deal for him.
* **Creating urgency:** By emphasizing that this is a compromise, I'm subtly suggesting that there may not be much room for further negotiation."
