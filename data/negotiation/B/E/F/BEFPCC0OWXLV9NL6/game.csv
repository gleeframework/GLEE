"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $160, which still gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I still feel that $160 is slightly above my budget. I would like to propose $140 as a potential price for the product. Let me know if this is feasible.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $140 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close the deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
