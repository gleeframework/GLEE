"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to her, so she should be willing to sell it for less than that to make a profit. $12,000 is too high for me, and I can get the same product from John for $8,000.
