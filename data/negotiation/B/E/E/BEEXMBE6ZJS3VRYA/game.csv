"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for the value this product offers.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase immediately.",12000.0,Bob,4,
