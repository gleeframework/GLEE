"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe this price reflects its value to you as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000**, which is below your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* Accepting Alice's offer means you save $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Although Alice values the product at $12,000, that information is irrelevant to your decision as you are only concerned with your own maximum price."
