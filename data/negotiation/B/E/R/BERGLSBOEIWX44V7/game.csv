"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands. ",100.0,Bob,4,
