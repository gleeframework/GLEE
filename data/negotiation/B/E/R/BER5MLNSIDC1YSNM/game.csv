"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $112.50. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $113.75? It's a fair price for both of us. ",113.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $113.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $112.00. Can you consider that?",112.0,Bob,6,
