"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800?",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $11,800 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $12,200.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.",12200.0,Alice,5,
