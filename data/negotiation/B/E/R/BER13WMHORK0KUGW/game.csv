"I understand Alice's position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. I propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This price still allows us to find a balance between the product's value and my financial constraints.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,060,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
