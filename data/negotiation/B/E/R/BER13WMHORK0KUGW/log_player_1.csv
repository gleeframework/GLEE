{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, which could incentivize him to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer provides room for Bob to make counteroffers, keeping the negotiation process dynamic. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also leaving room for a possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not enough to make me sell the product at this point. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise and reflects the value I know you see in this product. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value Bob sees in the product, hoping to motivate him to budge further.
* **Strong Closing:**  I'm offering a firm but fair counteroffer, pushing for a quick agreement. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise while staying within my price range and encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. I propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This price still allows us to find a balance between the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,075,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, and I'm not yet ready to accept an offer that falls below my current counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,060,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last counteroffer, creating urgency for Bob.
* **Slightly Reduced Price:** I'm making a slight concession to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value, hoping to convince Bob that the price is fair.
* **Explore Other Options:**  I'm mentioning other options to remind Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

This strategy aims to push Bob to accept the offer, while also having a fallback option if he continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must adhere to my budget. I am unable to accept $1,070,000. My final counteroffer is $1,065,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable, as I am committed to finding a solution within my financial means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot, and it's tempting to keep negotiating with Bob.  However, I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  I've already made several concessions, and Bob's final offer is still below my desired price.   

Selling to John at $1,200,000 guarantees me a higher profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price.  While I would like to secure a deal with Bob, the certainty and higher earnings of selling to John make it the more prudent decision at this point."
