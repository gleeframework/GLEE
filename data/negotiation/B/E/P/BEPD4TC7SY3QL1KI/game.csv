"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let it go for $8,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,1,
