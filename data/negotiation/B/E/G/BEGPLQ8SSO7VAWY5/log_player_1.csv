I'm aiming for a higher price and want to see if I can get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92 is still a bit below what I need to make this worth it for me. How about we compromise at $94? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 94}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $91 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John for $120.  It's the best outcome for me at this point."
