"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
