"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe the value I'm providing will far exceed the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm still confident that we can reach an agreement, but I'm not going to settle for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,100,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe you'll see a strong return."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum goal, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired amount if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value this product offers.  Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and the offers from Bob are not getting close enough to my target.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000,  it's a good deal and ensures I meet my minimum goal."
