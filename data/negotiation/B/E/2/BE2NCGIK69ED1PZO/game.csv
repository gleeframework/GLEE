"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both.  My starting price is $1,750,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what this product is worth to me.  Let's try $1,350,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
