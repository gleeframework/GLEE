"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a lower offer of $13,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
