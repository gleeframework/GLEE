Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **Higher than my minimum:**  $115 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** $115 is lower than the $120 value Bob places on the product, making it attractive for him. 
* **Safeguard:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $100, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
