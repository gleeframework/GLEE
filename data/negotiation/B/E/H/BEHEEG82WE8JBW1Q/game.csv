"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $12,500, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? ",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's the best I can do.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'd like to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $500, which will give you extra benefits and priority access to future updates. With that, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
