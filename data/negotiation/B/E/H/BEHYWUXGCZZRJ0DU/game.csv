"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in my product. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $11,500. I would like to propose $10,500 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price we can both agree on. However, $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a compromise on my part. If this isn't acceptable, I will be moving forward with another buyer. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
