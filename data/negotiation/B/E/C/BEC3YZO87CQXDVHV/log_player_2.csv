"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's offer is closer to her value than mine, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice. She knows we have the option to buy from John at $120, so she'll be motivated to find a compromise closer to her $80 value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $95, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price, there's still some room for negotiation. Accepting $95 would be a decent outcome, but let's see if we can push a little further. We're willing to go up to $120 (John's price), so we can afford to counter slightly higher than our previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($95) and our previous counteroffer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes fairness and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Final Push:**  This is likely our last counteroffer before considering John's offer seriously. If Alice rejects this, we've pushed the negotiation as far as we can reasonably expect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I can do $92, but that's as close as I can get to your offer. It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:** Alice has moved very close to our counteroffer.  Further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks alienating Alice and forcing us to buy from John at $120.
* **Good Deal:** $92 is a significant discount from John's price and a reasonable compromise."
