"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is close to my ideal price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and emphasize the value the product brings to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to try and secure a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Value of the Product:** I believe the product is worth more to Bob than $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John would be a safe option, but it would result in a lower profit. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $13,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm trying to keep the conversation friendly and collaborative.
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** My counter-offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Avoiding John:** For now, I'm still focused on getting a better price from Bob than I could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle again, at $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $12,500 is getting closer to my ideal price and is within my acceptable range. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject his offer and counteroffer again, he might walk away or refuse to increase his offer further. 
* **Value of Time:**  It's important to consider the value of time.  With each round, I'm getting closer to the deadline for selling to John.
* **Negotiation Success:**  $12,500 is a good result, especially considering that Bob started at $12,000. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal to John or a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better price."
