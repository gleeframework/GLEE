"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle again, at $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
