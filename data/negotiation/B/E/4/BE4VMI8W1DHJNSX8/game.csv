"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,000.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a great price for a product worth so much to you. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,
