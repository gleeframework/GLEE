"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm genuinely interested in acquiring it.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll still be getting a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $10,800. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
