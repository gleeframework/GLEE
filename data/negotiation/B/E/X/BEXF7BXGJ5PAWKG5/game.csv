"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
