# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can secure a better price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is still above your ideal price but below your maximum budget.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point.  

You're saving $25,000 compared to buying from John, and the potential for a better deal seems unlikely."
