"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000.  This is a substantial price reduction from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair offer that provides value for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I have another buyer ready to purchase at full value.
