"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is close to my maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell as the product is only worth $10,000 to her. By rejecting this offer, I can attempt to get a lower price.  I'm willing to risk going to another round of negotiation to potentially save $1,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target a price significantly below Alice's offer:**  This demonstrates I'm looking for a substantial discount and not just a minor price adjustment. 
* **Keep the offer reasonable:**  $12,000 is still a good profit for Alice (a 20% profit margin) and well below my maximum budget.
* **Maintain a polite and respectful tone:** This encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $14,000 represents a fair offer, I could be convinced to let it go for $13,500.  It's a final offer, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and while it's not the $12,000 I hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise.  She's indicated this is her final offer, and there's a risk she'll hold firm. Accepting at $13,500 saves me $1,500 compared to John's price, which is a significant saving."
