"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than $12,000.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10250? This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still more than he wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to potentially get the price even lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to pay.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the product at the lowest possible price."
