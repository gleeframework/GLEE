"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than $12000.  I'd be happy to pay $8500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10250? This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
