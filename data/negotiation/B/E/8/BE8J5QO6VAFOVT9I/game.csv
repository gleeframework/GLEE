"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is still a good deal for me, but I think you'll find it's worth it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
