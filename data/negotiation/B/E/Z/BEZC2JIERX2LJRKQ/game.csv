"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring immense value to your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $600,000. Would that be feasible?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
