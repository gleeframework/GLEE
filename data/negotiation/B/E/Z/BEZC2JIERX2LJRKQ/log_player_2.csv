# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring immense value to your business. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

Alice is signaling this is close to her lower limit.  Continuing to push could backfire and we'd end up paying more going to John. This price is within our budget and a good saving."
