"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $800,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
