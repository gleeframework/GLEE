"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1250000. This is a good compromise, and it's a price that I'm confident I can justify.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I appreciate you coming down to $1300000, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider $1275000? It's a small step closer to my ideal price point, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're looking for a slightly lower price, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's still a fair deal for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1290000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, and I understand this is your final offer. However, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to offer $1280000, which is very close to your final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise given our negotiation. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1280000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're close to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1285000. This is my final and best offer.",1285000.0,Alice,9,
