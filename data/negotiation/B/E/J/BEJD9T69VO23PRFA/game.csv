"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you place on your product,  $1250000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950000 is still out of my range.  As I mentioned before, $800000 is the absolute maximum I can offer for this product.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
