Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $12,000, so this offer gives you some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** It clearly states the price and gives a reason why it's a good deal for Bob.

By starting with a higher price, you set a strong negotiating position. You can then adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your willingness to potentially sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to counter with a price that's closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a fantastic deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still less than your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is closer to your minimum value. Accepting Bob's offer will allow you to complete the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed sale.  Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 if you feel you can get a better price later."
