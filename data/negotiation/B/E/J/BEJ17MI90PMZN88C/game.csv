"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This is a good compromise and will ensure a win-win scenario for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
