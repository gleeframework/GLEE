"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $975,000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
