Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $1,300,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price. How about $1,350,000? I'm confident this price is fair, given the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get a bit closer to my initial ask, Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer and is still significantly higher than what John would pay. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and prevents risking the deal falling through with Bob."
