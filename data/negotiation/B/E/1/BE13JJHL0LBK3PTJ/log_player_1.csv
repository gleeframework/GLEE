"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}

I'm going to counter with $98. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for a profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $96 is a good deal and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal."
