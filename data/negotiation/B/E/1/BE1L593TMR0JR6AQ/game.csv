"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? It's a fair price that allows for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
