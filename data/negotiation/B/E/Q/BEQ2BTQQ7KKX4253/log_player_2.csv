"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is truly exceptional. Considering its unique features and benefits, I'd like to propose an initial price of $15000. This reflects not only the cost of production but also the value we believe it holds for customers like you. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's aiming for a price of $12,000 or less and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's features, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
