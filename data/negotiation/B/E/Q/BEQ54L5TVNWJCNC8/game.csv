"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 represents the product's true value, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we settle on $10,500? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you're receiving.",10500.0,Alice,3,
