"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer you $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
