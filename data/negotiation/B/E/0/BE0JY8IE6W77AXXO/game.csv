"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $100? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can close this!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. How about $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I was thinking we could go back to my previous offer of $95. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?,95.0,Bob,6,
