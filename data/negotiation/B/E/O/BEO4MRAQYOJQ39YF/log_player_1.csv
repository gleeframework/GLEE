{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but not excessively high. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm in a good position. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to me, implying its worth. 

**Strategy:**

*  My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to make a deal with Bob if possible. By starting high, I can see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer. 
* I'm aware of John's offer, but I'll only accept it if Bob's counteroffers are too low or if I'm unable to reach an agreement with him within the 10 rounds."
