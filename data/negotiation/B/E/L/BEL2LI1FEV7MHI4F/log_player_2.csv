"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is above Bob's desired price point.
*  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $11,000, which is within Bob's budget.
* This is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $12,000. 
*  Even though Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and making a higher counteroffer, which could then lead to him having to buy from John at a higher price."
