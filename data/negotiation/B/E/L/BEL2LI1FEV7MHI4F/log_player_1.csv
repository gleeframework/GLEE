{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit too high for me.  How about $10500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's higher than John's offer, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
