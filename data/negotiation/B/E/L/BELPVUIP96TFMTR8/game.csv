"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to make a bit more than that. My counteroffer is $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I still need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1600000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
