"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high, above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to his $14,000 counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,000. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. It's a small increase, but it's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is refusing to budge below $15,500, which is still more than Bob's ideal price of $14,000.  Since John is willing to sell for $12,000, it makes the most sense for Bob to buy from him and save money."
