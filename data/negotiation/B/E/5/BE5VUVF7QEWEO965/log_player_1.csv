Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've chosen a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the message open-ended, inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts or a counteroffer.

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I want to hold out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this work for me.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reason:** I'm not just rejecting his offer but giving him a reason (needing to make it work for me) and a clear counteroffer.
* **Mid-Ground:**  $8,500 is halfway between my minimum and his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone, emphasizing agreement and a fair price to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum value.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely he'll budge much from this point.  Taking this deal ensures I get my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for the same price. It's a good outcome considering the potential for negotiation to stall."
