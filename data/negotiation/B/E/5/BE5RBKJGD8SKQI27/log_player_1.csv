Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and her minimum acceptable price is $12,000. Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and being ""open to discussing,"" Alice appears flexible and encourages a response from Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This allows her to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While the initial offer is high, Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob shows resistance. She needs to find a balance between maximizing profit and not pushing Bob away, ensuring she gets a price higher than John's offer."
