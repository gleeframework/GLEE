"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John offers. You should reject it and see if she'll come down.
