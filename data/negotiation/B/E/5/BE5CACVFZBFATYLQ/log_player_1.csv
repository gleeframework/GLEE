``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price point that's a good distance from my minimum acceptable price, but also leaves room for negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I need to ensure I get at least $8,000, and selling to John would be a safer option than accepting this offer.
* **Rejecting gives me more leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to counteroffer with a price closer to my target.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,800. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,400. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the maximum I can go. Can you consider it?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** Even with his final offer of $9,400, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **The negotiation is becoming too risky.** I'm starting to believe that Bob won't budge further and I don't want to risk the deal falling through altogether. 
* **Time to cut my losses.** It's better to sell to John for $8,000 than to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing.

Selling to John is the safest option at this point, as it guarantees me a profit, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
