"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also offering you a significant discount. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,015,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $990,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",990000.0,Bob,6,
