"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to compromise, $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
