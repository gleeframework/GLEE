# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth its weight in gold. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
