Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your own valuation and John's offer), you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,500,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still very profitable for you.
* **Justified value:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
