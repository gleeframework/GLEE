"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is under your $100 limit, you can likely get a better price. Alice is starting high. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt her to come down in price. You can always buy from John for $100 if necessary."
