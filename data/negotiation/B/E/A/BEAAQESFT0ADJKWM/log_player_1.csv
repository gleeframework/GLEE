"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to reject it.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial asking price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $10,000, and it's a decent profit for me.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a deal.  Accepting this offer is the best option to ensure I secure a sale and avoid risking a potential counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower."
