``` 

This offer starts at a price that's halfway between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's maximum willingness to pay. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** A $1,250,000 price offers a significant profit for you.
* **Initiate negotiation:**  It shows that you are open to negotiation but also confident in the product's value.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This gives Bob space to counteroffer without feeling pressured."

Bob has remained firm on his price, and it's clear we are not going to reach an agreement.  While $1,075,000 is close to my minimum, it's not enough to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000, as I'm guaranteed a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
