,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise.,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $95 is enough for me. How about we go a bit higher and meet at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit",110.0,Alice,5,
