"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than my budget allows. Would you consider $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $108. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
