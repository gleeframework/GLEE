"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that is closer to the maximum I know Bob is willing to pay. This gives me more negotiating room.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for the full $1,200,000, leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming higher:**  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I believe I can get.  
* **Negotiation room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives me a solid fallback position if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reiterating the value to Bob, reinforcing that my price is still attractive.
* **Building towards a deal:**  By narrowing the gap, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the goal:** Bob's offer is only $30,000 away from my last counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation rounds, but there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain. 
* **Time pressure:** As we're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, I need to be mindful of the time limit. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of running out of rounds."
