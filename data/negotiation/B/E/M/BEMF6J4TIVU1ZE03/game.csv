"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
