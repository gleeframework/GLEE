Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below his perceived value allows for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Strong Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so we don't need to be desperate. This strong fallback position allows us to aim high with Bob. 

**The offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, who offers a higher potential return than our guaranteed backup option.**"
