``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value but still lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counter with a higher offer again, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I understand we need to find a compromise, so I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not in a rush to sell and I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John. I will counter with a higher price again to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
