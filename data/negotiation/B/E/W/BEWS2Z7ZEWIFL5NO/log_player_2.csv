{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $80,000 above your ideal price of $1,300,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate may result in Alice becoming more stubborn, potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate. 
* **Time is ticking:** You've already used 5 rounds, and further negotiation could risk running out of time.

**Next Steps:**

Since you are willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product from John, accepting this offer from Alice is a good decision. It saves you $120,000 compared to John's offer, and you're likely to secure a better deal than you would if you continued negotiating."
