"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming to maximize my profits, while still being within Bob's range of affordability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to secure a price closer to my desired amount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  I believe this price is fair and will hopefully incentivize Bob to reach a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round.  I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1380000}

I'm countering with $1,380,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing that I am willing to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price that allows me to maximize my profits.  I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
