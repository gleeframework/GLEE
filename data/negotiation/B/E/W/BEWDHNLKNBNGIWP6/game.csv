"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to make this a win-win situation. I'm confident the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm also mindful of my budget. How about $700,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a win-win deal. However, I have to prioritize getting the best value for my product. Considering its true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given your original asking price and the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000.
