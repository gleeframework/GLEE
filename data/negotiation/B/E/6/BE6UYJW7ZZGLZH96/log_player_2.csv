Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $950,000 is unfortunately higher than my budget allows.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. In light of your offer of $875,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $890,000. This price still accounts for the product's value while allowing for a reasonable compromise. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, $890,000 is still a bit too high. You have a few more rounds, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her closer to your desired price of $800,000 or perhaps a compromise in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $880,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. In response to your offer of $880,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $885,000. This price maintains a fair balance between the product's value and your budget constraints. I believe this could be the final step towards closing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, it seems unlikely that Alice will come down further, especially since she's already moved significantly from her initial price. It's not worth risking running out of rounds to get a few thousand dollars off. You're better off buying from John at $800,000 to ensure you secure the product within your budget."
