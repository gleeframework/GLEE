"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something very valuable at a price that's more than fair. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed with buying from John at a much cheaper price."
