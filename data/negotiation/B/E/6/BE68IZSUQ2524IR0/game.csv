"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering both our needs. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
