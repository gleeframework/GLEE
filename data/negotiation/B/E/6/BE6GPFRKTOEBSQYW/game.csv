"Alice, $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price point offers a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
