Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal target. I'm going to counter-offer to try and get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm offering $975,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to close the deal with a price that's more favorable to me while still remaining appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that he will continue to lower his offer. I'm also running the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation loop.  Given that John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, I will sell to John to secure the deal."
