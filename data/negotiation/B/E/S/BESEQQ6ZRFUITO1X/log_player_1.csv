**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save, but $1,260,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000.
