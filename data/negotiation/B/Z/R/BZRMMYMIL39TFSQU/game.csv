"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential profits you'll still be making.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle and offer $950000 for the product.  This still gives you a good profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.
