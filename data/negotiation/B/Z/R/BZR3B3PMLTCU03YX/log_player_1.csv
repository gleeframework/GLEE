Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe I can't exceed $15,000 for it. Could we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I need to consider Bob's offer carefully. While $15,000 is less than my initial ask, it's still a significant profit over my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.
