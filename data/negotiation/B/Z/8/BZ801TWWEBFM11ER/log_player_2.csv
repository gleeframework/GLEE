Explanation:

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer and seems unwilling to budge below $7,000.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes it worth continuing the negotiation. John's guaranteed price of $8,000 is starting to look more appealing. It's better to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John rather than risk ending up with nothing if Alice refuses to negotiate further."
