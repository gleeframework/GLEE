"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  You have room to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore the possibility of a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (20% lower) signals your intention to negotiate seriously. This initial offer should gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects, we can continue to adjust the price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller margin this time. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only lowered her price by a small amount, and I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate. I'm also aware that John is a backup option, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a price I don't think is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to offer a price that's closer to my previous counteroffer, but still slightly lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this shows her that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not going to be bullied into accepting a price that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, it's still only a small reduction and is too high for my comfort zone. I want to keep negotiating to see if I can reach a more agreeable price. Remember, I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but I'm still under Alice's price point. I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both agree. With only a few rounds left, I want to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to my maximum price. While there's a slight chance she'll go lower, it's risky to keep negotiating.  We're in the last round, and John's offer is a guaranteed deal.  I'm not willing to gamble on Alice lowering her price enough to make it worth the risk.  Buying from John is the safest and most practical option at this point."
