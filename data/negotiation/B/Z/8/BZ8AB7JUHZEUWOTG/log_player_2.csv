"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also looking for a fair price. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, giving us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $800,000, it's still a significant discount from the product's true worth.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I want to keep the pressure on.  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but still believe the product is worth more than $950,000.  It also leaves room for a final compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately getting the product from John for $1,200,000 is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product at a significant discount, saving me $225,000."
