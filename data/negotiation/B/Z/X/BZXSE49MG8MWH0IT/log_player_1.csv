Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm open to negotiation, I'm encouraging Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive. 
* **Maintaining a Back-up:**  I'm always aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is key:** While I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll try to counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm offering $125, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my own interests.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation can help maintain a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is right at my minimum acceptable value.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a high chance of ending up with a deal that's not significantly better.
* **John offers a guaranteed higher price:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, which is a much better deal than what Bob is offering.
* **Time is a factor:** While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I risk wasting time and potentially missing out on the better deal with John. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the most profitable and time-efficient option."
