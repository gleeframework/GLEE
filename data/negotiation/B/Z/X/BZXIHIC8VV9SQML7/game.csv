"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable, but I need to be realistic with my budget. Could we consider a price closer to  $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. How about we agree on $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
