Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting the product's value to me.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should just sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, so I can't accept it. I will try to get a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's getting closer to my desired value. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
