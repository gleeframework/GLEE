"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $92.50.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $95, which is my lowest price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on price.  $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $92.50. I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $92.50 in Round 3, and Bob, you're coming back to that price in Round 6. I'm not willing to go back and forth on the same price. I'm willing to make one more move. I can offer $97.50, which is still a good deal for you, but also a fair price for me.",97.5,Alice,7,
