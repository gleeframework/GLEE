"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree there's potential, $1,150,000 is still a little too steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,075,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your investment considerations.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'd be happy to close this deal at $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
