"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what I could get from other potential buyers.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to give in to your price of $1,125,000. I'm going to make one more significant concession. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
