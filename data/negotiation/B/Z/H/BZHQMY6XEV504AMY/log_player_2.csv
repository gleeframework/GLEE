"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's ideal price of $1,500,000. It's better to reject and start counter-offering to save money. There are 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what I could get from other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $1,500,000. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob should continue negotiating.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,500,000.  However, with only 5 rounds left, Bob needs to be cautious about running out of time.  He should counter-offer one more time and if Alice rejects again, he may need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but still above his ideal. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting and going back and forth. This counter-offer is a reasonable compromise, leaving a little room for Alice to potentially come down slightly. If Alice rejects, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to give in to your price of $1,125,000. I'm going to make one more significant concession. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $1,500,000.  There are only 3 rounds left, and it's very unlikely Bob will be able to get Alice to go lower.  While buying from John is more expensive than his ideal price, it's the best option to guarantee he gets the product within the remaining rounds.  There is a significant risk of not being able to close the deal with Alice in the next couple of rounds."
