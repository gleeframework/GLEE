"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""benefits,"" aiming to justify the high asking price and appeal to Bob's desire for value.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the initial offer is high, it's crucial to remember that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently with Bob, knowing I have a strong fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant increase from his initial perception of the product's value, it's still below my target price.  I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll aim to counter with an offer that keeps the negotiation moving but doesn't concede too much ground too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you recognize the value of this product.  I'm willing to move a bit, how about we settle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $250,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Simplified Proposal:** By suggesting a round number like $2,000,000, I'm aiming for a clean and potentially more appealing offer. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I've made a concession, I'm not rushing to meet Bob in the middle. This keeps the negotiation active and allows me to gauge his willingness to move further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,750,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could take John's offer, I believe there's room for Bob to move closer to my range. I'm willing to make a smaller concession to signal I'm getting closer to my bottom line, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this product.  To show you I'm ready to make a deal, let's do this - $1,900,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100,000), signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line. This creates a sense of urgency without going below my minimum.
* **""Take it or Leave it"" Vibe:** The language suggests this is a final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  Importantly, I'm staying above my $1,500,000 minimum, preserving the option to walk away and accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $1,450,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. It's clear he's anchored to his initial valuation and isn't willing to meet my price range.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk a lower final offer, it's time to cut my losses. I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
