"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Since Bob has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, but she's getting closer. Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
