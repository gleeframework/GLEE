"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to go above $80. Would it be possible for us to reach a compromise at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
