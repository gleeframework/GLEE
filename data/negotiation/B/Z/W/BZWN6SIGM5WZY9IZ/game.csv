"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget.
