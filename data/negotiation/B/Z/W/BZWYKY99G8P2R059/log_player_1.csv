"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a better price.  I believe I can get closer to my initial offer by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still reasonable and might be attractive to Bob, while also getting me closer to my desired outcome."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to push for a better deal. I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from Bob, but I'm not ready to settle for $1,750,000 just yet.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,850,000. I'm slowly decreasing my price to meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept, but I'm also keeping in mind my minimum selling price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,775,000. We're getting close to a potential agreement. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be sure I get a price that's worth it."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  I've been steadily lowering my price, and we're now at a point where I'm comfortable accepting.  It's important to note that with only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still an option, but I'm hoping to get a bit more from Bob."
