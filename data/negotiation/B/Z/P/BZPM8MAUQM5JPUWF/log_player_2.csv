"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $8,000. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I would like to propose a price of $7,200 for it. I believe this offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,200 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,500.  Considering your product's value to you is $8,000, I believe this price still offers a solid profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the high demand for this item and the cost of production, I am unable to match your proposed price. I would like to offer the product to you for $6,800, which I believe strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** The $6,800 price tag is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **The potential savings are significant:**  Accepting Alice's offer means saving $1,200 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  While Bob could attempt to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. The risk of Alice walking away or delaying the transaction outweighs the potential for a small additional saving.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
