"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price.  Since you value the product at $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, but also want to keep the negotiation moving.  $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Be polite and appreciative:**  Maintaining a positive tone can encourage Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Stating you're ""happy to pay"" implies you're open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's still a significant saving from your initial valuation of $120 and only slightly higher than your counteroffer of $85.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John for $120."
