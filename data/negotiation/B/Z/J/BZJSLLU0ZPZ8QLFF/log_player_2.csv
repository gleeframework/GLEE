You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. I think it's a great deal for both of us!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $115, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to go. I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

```
At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $115 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the price going up in further negotiations."
