Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $120 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than $80, so it's in my best interest to start high.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I'm willing to go lower, but I'm starting with a price that gives me some wiggle room. 
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  While I'd prefer $120, I'm not being unreasonable and I'm showing Bob I'm open to a deal. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save a bit of money too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a decent profit for me, and it seems like Bob is serious about making a deal. I'll take it!"
