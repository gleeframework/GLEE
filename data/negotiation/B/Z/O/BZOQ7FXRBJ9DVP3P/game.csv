"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'll counter with a price of $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This price reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,060,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
