Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested - this is a great opportunity to acquire it immediately."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer price allows Alice to potentially maximize her profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants a lower price, while still ensuring Alice gets more than her minimum.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** Highlighting the ""immediate acquisition"" aspect subtly emphasizes that Bob could lose the opportunity if he hesitates, as Alice has another buyer lined up.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. Alice could adjust her offer in a future round based on Bob's response and her own risk tolerance."
