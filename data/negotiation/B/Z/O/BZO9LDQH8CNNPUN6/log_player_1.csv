Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price of $12,000.  I'll see if I can find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a good compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can finalize the deal."
