"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Strategy:** Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the best price possible, ideally below $9,000.
* **Counteroffer:** $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's still above Alice's minimum, so there's room for a deal. 
* **Strategy:** Start with a lower offer to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  Bob wants to set a lower price point for the negotiation and see if Alice will bite."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, and ideally get the product for less than $9,000.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer but still above his desired price.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the offer and continue to negotiate. There's still plenty of room to find a price that works for both parties.  There are 7 rounds left, so Bob can still try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Get the best possible price, ideally below $9,000.
* **Counteroffer:** $9,250 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying below his desired price point.
* **Strategy:**  Bob is trying to nudge the price down further, and the small increase in the offer shows flexibility. This could encourage Alice to accept and move closer to a deal."
