"Hello Alice, thanks for offering.  $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $95? That's a fair offer, considering the value we both see in the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, we're getting close! I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $100 even.  That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to accept $100, Bob. I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $105, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
