"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  Buying from John right away would be the easiest option, but there's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering.  $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it establishes a lower range.
* **Gauging Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer helps you understand how willing Alice is to move on price. Her response will give you valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still above your budget. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to settle yet. Let's see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $95? That's a fair offer, considering the value we both see in the product."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below your $100 limit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair offer"" and ""value we both see,"" you're reminding Alice that you're a serious buyer and are trying to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** There's still a chance Alice might hold out for a higher price. Keeping the negotiation moving and adjusting incrementally keeps the pressure on her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you're still not there yet. While $110 is tempting, remember your goal is to save as much as possible. You're only $10 away from John's price, so it's worth seeing if Alice will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, we're getting close! I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $100 even.  That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your target price and a reasonable offer. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you're better off securing the deal now rather than risking her walking away or the negotiations dragging on.
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating you're ""happy to close the deal right now,"" you add a bit of pressure and signal that this is your best offer.
* **Win-win framing:** Reminding Alice that this is a ""fair compromise"" where ""we both walk away happy"" reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to accept $100, Bob. I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $105, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105.  You've negotiated well, but it's time to cut your losses. John's offer of $100 is now the better deal, saving you $5. Sometimes the best negotiators know when to walk away from the table."
