"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to his ideal $8,000 value. This strategy hopes to quickly narrow the gap and incentivize Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and has a clear target.  He should continue to push for a lower price, aiming to get closer to his ideal $8,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while demonstrating his willingness to compromise. Offering $8,750 is a clear indication of his desire to reach an agreement while staying within his budget.  This offer is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to the middle ground. Let's try to make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stubbornly stuck to $9,000 for two rounds. While this is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob still has room to negotiate and save money.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further.  He's only had 5 rounds and the negotiation is far from over."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make this deal.  I'm willing to go up to $8,850.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8850}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently tried to get closer to $8,000, but Alice has been stubborn. To avoid getting stuck in a stalemate, Bob is now slightly increasing his offer. This small increase demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price closer to his target.  This move also puts the pressure back on Alice to accept or make a counteroffer."
