"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. $8,750 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to the middle ground. Let's try to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm ready to make this deal.  I'm willing to go up to $8,850.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good price.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, this is a good deal considering the number of rounds remaining. Selling to John for $8,000 would be less profitable, and the risk of further negotiation failing and ending up with no deal is high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit."
