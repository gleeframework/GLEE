Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value the product offers for Bob, encouraging him to consider the potential benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I phrase the message in a way that invites Bob to respond and negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept or make a counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 (from John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my initial offer, it's still below the $12,000 I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'll aim to bridge the gap between our current positions. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. My goal is to get closer to my desired price while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about $9,800?  That would be a great compromise, and we could finalize the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by proposing $9,800, which is halfway between our current positions. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I frame this as a compromise to encourage Bob to see the value of accepting.
* **Reiterate Desire for a Deal:** I express my desire to finalize the sale, suggesting that we're close to an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000.  I'll assess the likelihood of reaching a deal with Bob and weigh that against the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe I can secure the product from another source at a lower price. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I am unable to meet your current offer of $9,800. I will proceed with buying the product from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is a sure buyer, and his offer provides a much higher return.
* **No room for negotiation:** Bob has indicated that he is unwilling to increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**

It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, it's important to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
