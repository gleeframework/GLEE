"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about $9,800?  That would be a great compromise, and we could finalize the sale. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe I can secure the product from another source at a lower price. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I am unable to meet your current offer of $9,800. I will proceed with buying the product from John for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,4,
