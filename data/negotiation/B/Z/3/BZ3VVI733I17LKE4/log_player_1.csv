"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The high starting price helps gauge Bob's eagerness.  His reaction will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, I have the backup offer from John at $1,200,000. I will factor this into my decisions as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant increase, but it's still comfortably above his perceived value of $800,000. This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Not Close Enough:** While $950,000 is tempting, I'm aiming to maximize my profit. The difference between his offer and my desired price is still substantial.
* **John as Leverage:** I have the security of John's $1,200,000 offer. This allows me to be more assertive in pushing Bob closer to my desired price range.

**Strategy for Next Round:** In the next round, I'll counter with an offer closer to $1,050,000, maintaining a firm but flexible stance. This continues the negotiation momentum while aiming for a significantly higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By dropping $50,000 from my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still holding a strong position. 
* **Justification:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value, subtly anchoring the price around its worth rather than his budget.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing $1,050,000 positions the offer as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.  

**Overall Goal:** My goal is to gradually guide Bob towards a price closer to $1,100,000 or higher. I'm balancing firmness with flexibility to encourage a deal that benefits both parties while prioritizing my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but considering my financial situation, $1,050,000 is still quite high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant profit over his initial offer and a substantial amount overall. While I could potentially push for more, the risk of losing the deal increases.
* **Time Value of Money:**  We're four rounds in. Securing the deal now brings in the money faster.  Prolonged negotiations have a cost, even with a higher potential payout.
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than $1,000,000, especially given his repeated emphasis on budget constraints.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting $1,000,000 represents a favorable balance between risk and reward. It allows me to close the deal at a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, securing a healthy profit."
