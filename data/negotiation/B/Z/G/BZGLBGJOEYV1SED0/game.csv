"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your price.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price still gives you a great value, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and I believe we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
