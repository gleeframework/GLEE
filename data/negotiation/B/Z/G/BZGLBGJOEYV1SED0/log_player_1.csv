"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the deal.  

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** Starting high gives me leverage and encourages Bob to negotiate.
* **Show good faith:** Being friendly and upfront establishes a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Keep the option open:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not overly pressured to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **My Strategy:**  While I would like to sell, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum price at this stage.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John. 
* **Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap but still maintain a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your price.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price still gives you a great value, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial $14,000 offer, but it still keeps the price above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my reasoning for rejecting it. I'm also highlighting the value he'll get at the proposed price and emphasizing the possibility of closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Be reasonable:** The counteroffer is a significant step toward Bob's price, showing flexibility.
* **Stay positive:** The message maintains a friendly tone and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us and I believe we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **My Strategy:**  Given that we are nearing the middle ground, accepting Bob's offer is a good strategic decision.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Weighing Risks:**  I could continue negotiating, but there's a risk that Bob will become less willing to compromise, or I could end up having to sell to John for $15,000, which would be less profitable.  
* **Time Value:**  Since we're already in round 4, accepting this offer allows me to quickly close the deal and secure the profit.

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of $13,000, as it provides a good balance between profit and minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
