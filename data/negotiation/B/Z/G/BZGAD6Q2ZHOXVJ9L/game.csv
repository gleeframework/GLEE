"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would still give you a good return on your investment, and I'd be able to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make a deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $860,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $865,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",865000.0,Alice,5,
