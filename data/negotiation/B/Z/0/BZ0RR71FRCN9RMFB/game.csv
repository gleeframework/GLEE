"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, and I believe this is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can make this work.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
