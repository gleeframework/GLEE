Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting high gives us room to negotiate and still achieve a price significantly higher than our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Anchoring Bias:**  A high initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more willing to accept a lower (but still profitable) counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have the security of John's $15,000 offer.

**Important:** This strategy assumes we have some time and flexibility for potential negotiation with Bob. If a quick sale is more important, a lower initial offer closer to $15,000 might be more appropriate."
