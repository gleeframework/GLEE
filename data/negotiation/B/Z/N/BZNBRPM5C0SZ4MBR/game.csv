"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1300000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a good compromise.  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and your willingness to negotiate.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
