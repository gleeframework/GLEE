"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $8700 for this.  Let's find a middle ground.",8700.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8450. Can you consider that?",8450.0,Bob,4,
