,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
