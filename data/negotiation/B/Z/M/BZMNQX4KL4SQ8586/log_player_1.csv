"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This aggressive opening strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high initial price will reveal whether Bob sees significant value in the product.
* **Set a strong bargaining position:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a counteroffer.

I'm aware that this could lead to Bob rejecting the offer, but I believe the potential for a higher sale price outweighs the risk of losing the deal early on. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm aware that this negotiation is time-sensitive,  selling to Bob at this price would result in a substantial loss. I'm also not willing to accept the risk of losing the deal altogether with Bob.  

Therefore, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired value. This allows me to explore potential compromises while still maintaining a bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a lower price than my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price. This demonstrates my desire to reach a deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,300,000, and this counteroffer reflects that. It's still a significant sum for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm aware of the limited rounds, so I'm starting to adjust my strategy to be more conciliatory.

I believe this counteroffer provides a good balance between my desired price and a reasonable chance of securing a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his subsequent counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still below my desired value. I am not comfortable accepting this offer as it would mean a loss for me.

I'm aware of the time pressure, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price before having to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a significant concession from my previous offer, but it still keeps me within my minimum acceptable price range. Here's my reasoning:

* **Closing the Gap:** I am moving closer to Bob's offer to show my commitment to reaching a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between being firm on my price and avoiding a stalemate.
* **Exploring Potential:**  I believe this offer is within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate further. It allows for a final round of counteroffers before I have to consider selling to John. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John as the remaining rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decision that balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal. 

While I would ideally like to get closer to $1,250,000, the potential for a counteroffer below my minimum acceptable price is too risky. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,225,000."
