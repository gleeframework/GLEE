"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) because I want to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being positive and encouraging, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $80 just isn't enough for me.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to budge a little too.  How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell below $100, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  I'm going to have to stick to my minimum and ask for $95.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm going to try one more time with my minimum price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John and get my minimum."
