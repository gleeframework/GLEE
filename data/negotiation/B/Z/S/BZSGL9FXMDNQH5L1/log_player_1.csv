While a higher price might be achievable, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are getting closer to the halfway point between our initial asking price and his initial offer.  Accepting at $1,750,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later in the negotiation."
