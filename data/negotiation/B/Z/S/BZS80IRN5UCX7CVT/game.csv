"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,750,000. This offer takes into account the product's worth and allows for some room for negotiation.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
