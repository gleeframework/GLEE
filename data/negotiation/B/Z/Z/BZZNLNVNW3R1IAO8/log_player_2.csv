"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice's counter-offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
