"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in making a deal, but I'm only able to offer $85 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. I am unable to accept $85 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $95 as a new offer?",95.0,Alice,3,
