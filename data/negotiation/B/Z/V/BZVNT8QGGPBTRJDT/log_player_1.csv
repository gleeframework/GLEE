{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $150, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. This allows you to potentially meet in the middle at a price still above your minimum. 
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $120, there's a possibility he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or if it's difficult to find elsewhere.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for further discussion. You can then decide whether to lower your price slightly or move on to John, ensuring you get at least your minimum price."
