{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get a better deal, as the product is worth $100 to you and only $80 to Alice.  You can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to me and only $80 to Alice. Hopefully, Alice will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 91}
``` 
I'm offering $91 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to both of us."
