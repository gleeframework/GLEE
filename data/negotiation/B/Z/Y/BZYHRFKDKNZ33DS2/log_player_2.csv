# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offer takes into account both the significant value it holds for you and my desire to maximize the return on this valuable item. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further or if there's any other way I can assist you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her $8,000 valuation."
