# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so he should aim to get a better price than Alice's initial offer of $11,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
