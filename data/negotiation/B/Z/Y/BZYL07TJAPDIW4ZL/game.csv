"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $90. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to be reasonable here. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your time and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $88 is still below my minimum. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $92. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $92 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $89, but I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options. Can you meet me at $89?",89.0,Bob,8,
