"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? This is a good compromise, and it still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum price, I am still not willing to sell at that price. It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $12,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob in the hope of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $10125. How about $9937.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,937.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,937.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. With only 4 rounds remaining, I am not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome for me. I will continue negotiating with Bob in the hope of getting closer to my target price, but I am not willing to accept a price that is below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,937.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise one last time, but I need to stay above $10,000. How about $10,031.25? This is a very small step down from my last offer and it would allow us to finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10031.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10031.25 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $10031.25. How about $9890.62? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,890.62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,890.62
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price of $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on. Selling to John for $12,000 is the best decision at this point. I'll avoid further negotiation and secure the best possible outcome for myself."
