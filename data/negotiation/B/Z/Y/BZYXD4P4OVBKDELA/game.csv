"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10500? This is a good compromise, and it still represents a great value for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $10000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10125? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $10125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $10125. How about $9937.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",9937.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9937.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise one last time, but I need to stay above $10000. How about $10031.25? This is a very small step down from my last offer and it would allow us to finally reach an agreement.",10031.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10031.25 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $10031.25. How about $9890.62? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",9890.62,Bob,8,
