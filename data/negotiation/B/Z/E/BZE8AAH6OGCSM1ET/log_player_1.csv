```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'll be keeping a close eye on his response and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer. He's essentially trying to get the product for my absolute bottom line. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than my last counteroffer.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a reasonable deal and a secure sale. I'll accept his offer and move on."
