{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than your minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is above Bob's stated value, it's still below your minimum.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?  That way we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really determined to get this product, so how about we settle on $130?  That way we can both get a good deal and close this quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is still slightly below my minimum, it's very close, and Bob seems committed to buying it.  It's not worth risking losing the sale to John, especially since I can always try to get a better price from another buyer in the future."
