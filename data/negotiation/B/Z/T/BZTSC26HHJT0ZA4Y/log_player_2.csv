"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most sense."
