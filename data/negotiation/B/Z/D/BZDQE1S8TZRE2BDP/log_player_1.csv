Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $175. It's likely Bob will reject this offer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $150 as possible, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering with $140.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my minimum, it's only $20 below.  Considering I could sell to John for $150, I'm taking the risk of selling to Bob now.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and it's possible I could end up with nothing if I keep rejecting and John decides to buy elsewhere.  I'm willing to take the $130 to secure the sale."
