"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still not meeting my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500?  This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will bring you great returns.  Let's finalize this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this is the sweet spot for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
