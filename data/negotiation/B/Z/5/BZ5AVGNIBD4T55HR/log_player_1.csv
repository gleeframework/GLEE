Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,050,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement without having to sell to John."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and we've only got a few rounds left. I don't want to risk losing the deal to John or continuing to negotiate and ending up with a worse price."
