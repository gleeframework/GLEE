Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest in a product that will bring a significant return, and that means I need to be able to acquire it at the right price. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this reflects the value it brings to me, while also allowing you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $650,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair price given the current market. Let's see if we can close this deal.
