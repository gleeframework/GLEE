"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I think the product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice, but $160 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $140? It's a fair price that allows me to save some money and for you to get closer to your desired price.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $140. I'm willing to compromise at $155, which is still a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,,
