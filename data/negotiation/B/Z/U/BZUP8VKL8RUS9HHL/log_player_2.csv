Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value you place on the product is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can live with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price you can accept.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's clear she's unlikely to meet my needs. Her latest offer is still $250,000 over my maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed price that ensures I stay within my limits.  It's time to cut my losses with Alice and buy from John."
