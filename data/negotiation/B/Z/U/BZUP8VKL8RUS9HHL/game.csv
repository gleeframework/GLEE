"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value you place on the product is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I agree $1,100,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $725,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price you can accept.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
