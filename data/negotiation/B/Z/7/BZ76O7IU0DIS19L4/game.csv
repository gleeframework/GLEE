"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for less than it's worth to you, and I'll get a fair profit. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
