"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above your desired price point. You can definitely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  You'll have room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit from the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You can likely push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."
