"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still leaves plenty of room for you to benefit from the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  This would give you a decent profit and still allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
