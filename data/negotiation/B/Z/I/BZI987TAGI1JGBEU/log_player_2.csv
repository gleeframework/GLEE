"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price we can both be happy with. How does $12,000 sound? It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Alice benefits too:** While you get a good deal, Alice is also getting a better price than her minimum value of $8,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money while still acquiring the product."
