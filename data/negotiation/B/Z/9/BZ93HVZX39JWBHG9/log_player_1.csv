"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves open the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can work towards a final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, showing some flexibility, but still staying above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'm confident I can either get a better offer from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm approaching my minimum threshold. This is a strong signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I still have John as a backup if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better offer, and I still have John as a backup. I have 4 rounds left to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm taking a risk by lowering my price again, but I'm confident that Bob is getting more serious about the deal and will likely accept this offer.  I'm now very close to my minimum threshold, and if Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting very close to my minimum threshold, but I have to prioritize getting the best possible price. Bob is clearly unwilling to go any higher. I'm selling to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee a satisfactory deal."
