,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and I can't go as low as $14,000. Would you consider $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
