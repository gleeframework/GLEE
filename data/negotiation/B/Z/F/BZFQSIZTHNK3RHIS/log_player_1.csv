{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even more potential for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is more than what I would get from John, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $950,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far from what I know the product is worth. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a very fair price considering the product's potential value to you. Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so how about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my bottom line, I still believe I can get a better price with Bob.  I'm going to continue negotiating in the next round and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there at $975,000. It's important for me to get closer to my desired value. Let's split the difference again. How about $987,500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want to get closer to your desired value, but I'm still not comfortable with $987,500. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $980,000 is a good price, and it's better than what I would get from John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
