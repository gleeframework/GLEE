"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $950000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that offers a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  My final offer is $825000.  This is a strong offer that allows you to make a significant profit while also giving me a great deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $900000, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $862500. This is a reasonable compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.",862500.0,Alice,5,
