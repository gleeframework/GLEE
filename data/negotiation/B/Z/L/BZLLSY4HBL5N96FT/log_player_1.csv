Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his eagerness. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have gone even higher. If he rejects, we can always come down to his value or sell to John. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a safety net with John, guaranteeing us at least $120. This allows us to be more assertive with Bob."
