"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. You have significant room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your actual top price ($120). This leaves room for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating environment but firm in stating your price. 
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This counter-offer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your range, $140 is still above your maximum budget. You have some bargaining power left before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this purchase."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You're moving closer to your maximum but in a way that suggests you're willing to negotiate further.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By expressing eagerness, you're subtly adding pressure without being aggressive.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge if Alice is willing to go below $140."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $130. If that doesn't work, I'll have to sell it to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she won't go lower than $130.
* **John's Price is Better:**  You've reached a point where the potential savings from Alice are minimal ($10) compared to the guaranteed price from John ($120).
* **Avoiding Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result and could lead to missing out on the product altogether."
