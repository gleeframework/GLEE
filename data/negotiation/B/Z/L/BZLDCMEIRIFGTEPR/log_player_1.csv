Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value to Bob, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I can likely get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise and is only $500 less than my initial offer.  It's worth accepting rather than risking another round of negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a sale to John for $12,000."
