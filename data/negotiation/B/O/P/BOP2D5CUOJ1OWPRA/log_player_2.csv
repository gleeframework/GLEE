"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $1,000,000 is not a good strategy. It's also too early to buy from John because you haven't even explored Alice's willingness to negotiate.

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant counteroffer,  offering half of Alice's initial price. This is a bold move that shows your willingness to negotiate, and forces Alice to reveal her bottom line. It's important to start strong to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of money.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price, but it's still not where you want it to be.  This counteroffer is a compromise, coming in closer to her offer but still significantly lower than her initial asking price.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating your willingness to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not quite at a point where accepting her offer is the best choice. Continuing to negotiate offers the potential to save even more money. Buying from John right now would mean paying a higher price than Alice's current offer, which is unnecessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a compromise counteroffer, slightly higher than your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving and demonstrates your willingness to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has continued to lower her price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or running out of rounds increases.  At this point, accepting her offer at $800,000 is a good strategy.  You've saved $200,000 compared to John's offer and secured the product."
