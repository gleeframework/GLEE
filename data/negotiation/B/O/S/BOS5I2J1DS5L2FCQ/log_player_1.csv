I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, and it's a price that I'd be happy with.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe it's worth more than $8,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than $8,000, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe the product has more value than that. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm offering $9,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving Bob a chance to get a better deal than $8,500."

Bob seems to be firm on $8,500.  While I'd like to get more, I'm not willing to risk a long negotiation that could lead to a lower price or no sale at all. Selling to John for $8,000 ensures a sale and a guaranteed profit."
