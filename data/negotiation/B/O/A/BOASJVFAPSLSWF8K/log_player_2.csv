This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $410,000 less than John's price.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final compromise. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Invested:** You've already put in several rounds.  While you could try for a slightly lower price, the potential gain might not outweigh the risk of Alice digging in or you running out of rounds."
