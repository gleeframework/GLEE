Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
