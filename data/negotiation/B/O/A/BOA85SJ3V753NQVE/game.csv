"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. While I see the value in this product, my budget is firm.  Would you be willing to come down to $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
