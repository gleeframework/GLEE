# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a price below its worth to you, and I get to sell it without waiting for another buyer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
