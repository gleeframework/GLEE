Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and Bob seems willing to pay that much.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,800,000. I believe this is fair, considering the product's value and potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your offer, and I would like to propose a price of $1650000 for your product. This seems to be a fair compromise given its value and potential. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
