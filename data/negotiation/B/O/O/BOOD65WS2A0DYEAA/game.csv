"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. Is this something you'd be interested in?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can offer you a compromise at $180. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell the product for $150, as I've already told you that my minimum price is $200. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $170. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $170 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer of $200, which would be $160. Can you consider that?",160.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $160, as I think the product is worth more than that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $175, which is still above my minimum price, but below my original offer. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",175.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $175, which would be $172.50. Can you consider that?",172.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made two concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $175. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $25, so the total value of the deal would be $200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",175.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer of $200, which would be $100. I think this is a fair price considering the extras you're offering. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,10,
