Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that you value the product at $150, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
â€¨
Bob is already at his maximum valuation. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price. It's best to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
