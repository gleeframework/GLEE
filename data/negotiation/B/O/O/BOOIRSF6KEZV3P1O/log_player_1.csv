"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a significant profit for myself. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, it's best to start high and see where the negotiation leads."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
