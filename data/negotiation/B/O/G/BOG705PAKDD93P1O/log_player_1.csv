Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?
