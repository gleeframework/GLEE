"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  How about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $112.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $112.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and call it $108.75. I'm sure you'll still make a profit, and I'll be able to get the product within my budget.",108.75,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price. I can do $113. I think it's still a fair offer considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",113.0,Alice,5,,
