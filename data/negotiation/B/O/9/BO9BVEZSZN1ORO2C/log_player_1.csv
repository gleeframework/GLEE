Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob why it's worth a significant investment.
* **Alternative Option:** By alluding to selling the product ""publicly,"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act on your offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in a conversation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

While John offers a safety net at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
