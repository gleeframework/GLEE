"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way beyond my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I could go up to $7,000.  This is a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for a similar price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $7,000 is too low for me to accept.  However, I'm willing to make another move to see if we can close this.  Would you consider $14,000? This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
