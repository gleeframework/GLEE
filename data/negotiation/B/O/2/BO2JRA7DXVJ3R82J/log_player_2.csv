"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $14,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer at a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. Would you consider $13,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to negotiate a lower price, but he's staying within a reasonable range.
* $13,000 is still above Alice's desired price of $12,000, so there's room for a potential deal.
* This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,750? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* This price is a good compromise, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,500 but higher than Bob's counteroffer of $13,000.
* While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price, and it's likely Alice won't budge much lower."
