"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to buy from John for $1,000,000 than to pay Alice $1,000,001. Even though you can try to negotiate with Alice, it's unlikely she'll come down to your desired price range, and it's a risk that you could end up paying more than you want to."
