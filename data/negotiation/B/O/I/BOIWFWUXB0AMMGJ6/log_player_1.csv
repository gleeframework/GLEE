Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm willing to go lower than my minimum, but not by much. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to me, implying that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm open to Bob's counteroffer, but I have a backup buyer, John, in case the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I can only offer $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to make this worthwhile.
* **I have a better option:**  I can sell to John for a higher price, making it a more appealing choice than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise. I'm hoping to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to my desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I can realistically accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground. 
* **Framing it positively:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not dropping my price significantly. $1,350,000 is still within my acceptable range, and it's closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm giving Bob a chance to accept this compromise, but I'm prepared to continue the negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,325,000 for your product. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation stalemate:**  We've gone back and forth, but it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. Continuing to negotiate might result in more back-and-forth with no clear progress.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price.  

It's better to take the guaranteed profit with John than risk further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum requirement."
