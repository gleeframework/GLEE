Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate lower, or reject it outright."
