"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
