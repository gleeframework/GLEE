"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know its value to you is even greater.  Let's start with a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given its potential to benefit your business."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be beneficial, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product with immense potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm also confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if I sell to him, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $975,000 is still not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000, which reflects the value of this product and allows for a fair profit margin. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
