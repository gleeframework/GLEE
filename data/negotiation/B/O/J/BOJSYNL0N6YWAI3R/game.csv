"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know its value to you is even greater.  Let's start with a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given its potential to benefit your business.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be beneficial, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product with immense potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $975,000 is still not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000, which reflects the value of this product and allows for a fair profit margin. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
