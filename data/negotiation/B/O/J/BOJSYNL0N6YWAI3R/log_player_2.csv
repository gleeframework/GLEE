"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know its value to you is even greater.  Let's start with a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, given its potential to benefit your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be beneficial, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product with immense potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?"", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $975,000 is still not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000, which reflects the value of this product and allows for a fair profit margin. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while it's not the steal we might have hoped for, it's significantly less than John's $1,200,000 price. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable saving."
