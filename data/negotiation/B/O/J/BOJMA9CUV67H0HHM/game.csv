"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand that's a significant investment. I could come down to $17,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $17,000 is really my bottom line to make this worthwhile. Perhaps we can explore financing options or a payment plan if that would help bridge the gap?",17000.0,Alice,5,
