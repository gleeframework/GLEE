"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting gives you a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I've done some further research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,350,000 is within your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for saving more is limited:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially going back up in price exists.
* **Good middle ground:** $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's likely to be close to Alice's bottom line given her initial offer."
