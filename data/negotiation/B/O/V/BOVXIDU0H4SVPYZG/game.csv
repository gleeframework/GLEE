"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I've made a serious offer of $575000, and you've countered with $600000. I'm not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to know you're willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $575000 and $600000, so I'll offer $587500.

"I've made several serious offers, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $587500. I'm starting to think that this product is not worth the hassle, and I'm considering buying it from John for $1500000. I'll make one last offer, but I'm not expecting it to be accepted. I'll meet you at $587500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",587500.0,Bob,10,
