,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If that's not acceptable, I may have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $98.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a price we can both agree on, but $102 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $99 and that's my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $102 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $99. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,9,
