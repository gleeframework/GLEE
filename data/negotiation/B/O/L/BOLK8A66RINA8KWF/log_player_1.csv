Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you at $105. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price. It's best to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob or running out of negotiation rounds."
