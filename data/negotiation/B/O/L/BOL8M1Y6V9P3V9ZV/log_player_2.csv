The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $130. There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable with $135.  It's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product by trying to push further."
