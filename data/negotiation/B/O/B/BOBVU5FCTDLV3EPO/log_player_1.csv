Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal, even if he doesn't negotiate.
* **Above Your Minimum:** $119 is comfortably above your $100 minimum, ensuring a good profit.

By setting the price at $119, you create a win-win situation where Bob gets the product for less than its value to him, and you maximize your profit."
