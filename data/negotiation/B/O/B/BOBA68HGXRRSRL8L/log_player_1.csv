{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but you can still potentially get more.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 135}
