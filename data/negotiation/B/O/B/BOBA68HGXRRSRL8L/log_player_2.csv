"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for a product worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd like to pay less,  $135 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $150, and it's a reasonable compromise with Alice. Accepting the offer secures the product and saves you $15."
