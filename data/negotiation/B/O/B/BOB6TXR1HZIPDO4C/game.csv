,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desired sale price. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This offer is my final one, let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. The product price will be $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
