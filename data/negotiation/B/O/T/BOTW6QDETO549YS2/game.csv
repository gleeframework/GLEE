"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little low for me. I'd be happy to accept $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
