"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  I can go up to $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I'm sensing we might be getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would be my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
