"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation. Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,700,000. This is the maximum I'm comfortable paying for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to drop my price to $1,800,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my strong desire to see this deal through with you. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
