"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:**  Starting high allows for room to negotiate and sets a strong baseline.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the value of the product can help Bob see the potential benefit. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to counter. 

**Important Note:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price.  However, the risk of Bob walking away is present. I'll assess his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000, and $900,000 isn't enough.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, the fact that he's willing to negotiate means there's room for a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which is closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I'll need to be strategic and  assess Bob's potential willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and provides you with a significant saving compared to my initial offer.  Let's work together to reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's price:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on value and compromise:**  I'm highlighting the product's value while emphasizing my flexibility. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

**Important Note:**  I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess the situation and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the compromise we've already made. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While he's moved closer to my desired price, $975,000 is still less than the $1,000,000 I can get from John.
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for compromise.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option:**  I have a backup plan that guarantees me a higher price than Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

In Round 5, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's $975,000 but still above my minimum threshold. I'll need to weigh the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer against the potential gain of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While I value your continued interest, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering $1,025,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay above minimum:**  I'm bridging the gap between our positions, but I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my leverage.
* **Emphasize compromise:**  I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate and emphasizing the concessions I've already made.
* **Positive and decisive tone:**  This encourages Bob to accept the offer and finalizes the deal.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in Round 6.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000.
* **Negotiations have reached a stalemate:**  Despite multiple rounds of negotiation, we haven't found a price that works for both of us.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is both my minimum acceptable price and a better outcome than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, this decision ensures I achieve my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
