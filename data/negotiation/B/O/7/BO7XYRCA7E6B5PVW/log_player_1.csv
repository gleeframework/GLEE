``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a price that is a good compromise. It's above Bob's value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* The message is friendly and positive, focusing on the benefits for both of us. 
* I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, but by starting with a strong offer, I signal that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?  I think that's a fair offer, considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  this offer is too low to consider. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  This will allow for further negotiation while still ensuring I receive a good return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $1,100,000? This still allows you a good deal, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a compromise that is closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's above Bob's offer but below my minimum acceptable price.
* The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* By offering a counteroffer, I show that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price that is beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $1,100,000 is closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to push for a higher price to ensure a good return.  I will counter with a price that is closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for compromise."

Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Explanation:**
