"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a good return for me.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?  I think that's a fair offer, considering its market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $1,100,000? This still allows you a good deal, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $1,100,000 is closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still giving you a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
