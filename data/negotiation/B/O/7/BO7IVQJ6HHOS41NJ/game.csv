"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product has potential, however, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
