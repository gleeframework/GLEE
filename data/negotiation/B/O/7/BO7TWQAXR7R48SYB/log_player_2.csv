"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $100. Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within Bob's budget.  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also sets a clear expectation that he's not willing to pay Alice's full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from the first round, which is not favorable for Bob. While $115 is still within Bob's budget, it's not a good deal considering his goal is to save as much as possible.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $100. This time, he increases his offer by $3, showing a willingness to compromise but also emphasizing that he wants to be closer to the $105 he offered earlier. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is still higher than the product's worth to Alice. While this is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price.  Bob has 5 rounds left, and a lower price is still possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $112, and Bob has been consistently offering lower prices. By offering $110, Bob is showing that he is willing to compromise but is also getting closer to his ideal price point. This is a strategic move to see if Alice will accept, as it's a smaller gap than her previous offer.  If she rejects, Bob will have to consider his options more carefully in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation has reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to go below $115, and Bob's previous offer of $110 was rejected.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of Alice accepting a lower price are slim. 

Buying from John for $120 guarantees Bob the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation. While it's not the best price, it's within Bob's budget and ensures he gets the product.  It's also important to note that further negotiation might lead to a more expensive price in the end."
