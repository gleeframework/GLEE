"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but within a range that seems reasonable for such a valuable item. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a clear gap between my price and Bob's perceived value, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value and potential to entice Bob to consider the offer. 

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation while leaving me an option to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices.  I want to see if I can push him higher or if he's truly unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which reflects the product's unique value and the potential it holds. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but not giving in to his initial low price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, suggesting flexibility, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price, indicating I'm not desperate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value and potential, hoping to persuade Bob that this price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I still believe I can get a better deal. There's still a gap between his offer and what I'm willing to accept, and I'm not ready to settle just yet. 

I'm choosing to reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to push him higher.  

However, it's important to note that I'm getting closer to my ""Sell to John"" threshold. If negotiations don't progress favorably in the next few rounds, I might consider selling to John and securing a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $975,000. This price is fair, considering the product's unique value and the potential we've discussed. It's a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by offering a price that is significantly closer to Bob's last offer. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential, emphasizing that this price reflects its worth.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the benefits for both of us, creating a sense of win-win and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'm cautiously optimistic that this counteroffer will be successful. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider my options. I'm now only $25,000 away from my ""Sell to John"" threshold, and time is running out. If I can't get a better deal in the next few rounds, I might have to go with John and guarantee myself $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my current budget. I'm confident that we can reach a final agreement with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, as it's only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm still not willing to settle for that amount. 

Here's why:

* **Time:** We're halfway through the negotiation process. I have four rounds left, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential:**  I believe the product is worth more than $950,000, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal.
* **John:** While I'm getting close to my ""Sell to John"" threshold, I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a more favorable price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can push him a little higher. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still slightly lower than where I need to be.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $965,000. This price is a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and your budget.  I hope we can close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win solution. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by stating ""I hope we can close this deal now,"" hoping to motivate Bob to accept before I consider selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

This is a crucial round. If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'm only $35,000 away from my ""Sell to John"" threshold. In the next round, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $965,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $960,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. However, I've now reached a critical juncture in the negotiation.  

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to our last two rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll increase his offer further, and I could end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.
* **Guarantee vs. Risk:**  By selling to John, I'm guaranteed $1,000,000. While this is a bit less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a significant amount of money, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

Therefore, to secure a guaranteed profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. It's a calculated decision based on the limited time remaining and the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
