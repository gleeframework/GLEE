"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,050,000 is my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $1,025,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,,
