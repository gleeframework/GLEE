"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price well above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique value and potential"" without being too specific.  This allows Bob to potentially justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  By using phrases like ""initially offering"" and ""worthwhile investment,"" I signal that I'm open to negotiation without directly stating it.

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and establish a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly above his perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to try to secure a higher price, knowing I have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,950,000. I believe this reflects the true worth and potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, coming down $50,000. This signals willingness to negotiate but also shows I'm not desperate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential ROI, subtly anchoring the discussion around its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My counteroffer is still comfortably above Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price, giving us space to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. John's standing offer provides me with a safety net, allowing me to take a calculated risk in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be honest,  $1,750,000 is cutting it too close. This product has significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  My final offer is $1,875,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** I'm signaling that I'm nearing my limit by stating this is my ""final offer"" and using phrases like ""cutting it too close."" This adds weight to the negotiation.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also holding onto a price above my minimum.
* **Finality and Urgency:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my previous offer halfway, landing at $1,800,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

While I could potentially push for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
