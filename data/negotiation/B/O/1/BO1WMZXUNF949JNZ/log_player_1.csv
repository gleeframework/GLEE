Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* By offering a higher price, I'm trying to maximize my potential profit. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to still sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer.  I might be willing to negotiate the price if Bob counters.
* It's crucial to understand Bob's potential valuation of the product to make a more informed offer.
* I'm not taking into account any potential costs of selling to Bob (e.g., shipping, transaction fees)."
