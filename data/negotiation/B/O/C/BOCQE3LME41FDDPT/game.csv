"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your previous offer and my initial offer.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still not in my best interest. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  I'm offering you the product for $1,087,500. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it's a fair and mutually beneficial price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement on this.  Let's close this deal!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
