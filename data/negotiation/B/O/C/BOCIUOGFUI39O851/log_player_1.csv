Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you for $750,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $1,500,000. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John), we want to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **The Strategy:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's valuation creates a strong incentive for him to buy. It seems like a good deal to him while still giving us a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation, and Bob might try to counter-offer.  We'll need to be prepared to respond strategically depending on his response."
