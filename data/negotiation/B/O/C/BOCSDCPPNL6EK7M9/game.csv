"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and more than I need. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This still gives you a healthy profit and is a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  I'm still a bit high, but I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to save a considerable amount of money.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
