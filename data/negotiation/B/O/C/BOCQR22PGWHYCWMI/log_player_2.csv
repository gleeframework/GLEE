"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at $1,500,000.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,600,000, which is more than your limit.  Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
