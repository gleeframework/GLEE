"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is far higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's also higher than what you know the product is worth to Alice ($1,500,000).  Therefore, rejecting her offer and attempting to negotiate is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000, which is my maximum budget. 
* This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000. 
* Hopefully, this will prompt Alice to counter with a price closer to my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I will continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,350,000, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still staying within my budget constraints.  This is a more reasonable middle ground than my previous offer, and hopefully, it will encourage Alice to come down further."
