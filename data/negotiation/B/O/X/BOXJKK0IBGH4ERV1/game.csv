"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $11,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
