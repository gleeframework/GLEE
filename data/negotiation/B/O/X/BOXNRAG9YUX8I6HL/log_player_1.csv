Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum ($15,000).
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a higher initial price, you set a psychological anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started low.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $15,000, providing leverage in your negotiation with Bob. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message to Bob is framed confidently, emphasizing the product's value and existing interest to encourage him to act quickly."
