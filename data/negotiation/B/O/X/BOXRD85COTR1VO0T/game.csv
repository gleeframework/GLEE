"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $950000 to make it worth my while.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, and I'm willing to go a bit higher.  However, $950000 is still a bit too much for me. I can offer $900000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and my target profit. I can do $920000, but that's as low as I can go.",920000.0,Alice,5,
