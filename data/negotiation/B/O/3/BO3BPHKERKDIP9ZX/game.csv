"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way to $90. How about we try $105? It's a compromise that gets us closer to your target price, but still reflects the value I think the product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit away from your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $102? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still a good balance between our values.",102.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to pay $102. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. That's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",92.0,Bob,6,
