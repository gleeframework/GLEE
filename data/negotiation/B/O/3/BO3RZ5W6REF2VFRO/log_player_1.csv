"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make sure I get a price closer to my value of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,800? It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still find great value in the product."", ""product_price"": 12800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,800. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $12,500. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $12,500 is still too low. I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,700? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from $12,700. I'd like to make a final offer of $12,600. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,600. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired value and I'm running out of rounds.  It's a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000 and I'm confident I can use the extra time to find another buyer for something worth closer to $15,000 in the future."
