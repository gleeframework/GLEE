Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't sell this product for less than $10,000. It's a final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $10,000.  It's clear she won't go any lower. Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's in your best interest to take that deal and save the $2,000."
