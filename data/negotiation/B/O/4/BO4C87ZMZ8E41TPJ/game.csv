"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $11,000. This is my best offer and a fair price for such a high-quality product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a firm budget. I could increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a fair offer considering I can buy it for $8,000 elsewhere.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
