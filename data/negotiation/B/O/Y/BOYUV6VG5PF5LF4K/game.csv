"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $15,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $13,500?  I think it's a reasonable compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $14,250.  This price acknowledges the value of the product to you while ensuring I receive a fair return.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to go down to $14,100.  This is my final offer, as it's only $100 above my minimum.  I believe this is a fair price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's seal the deal!",14100.0,Alice,7,
