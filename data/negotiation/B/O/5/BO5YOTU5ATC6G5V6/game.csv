"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $10,000. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can go up to $11,000.  That's a fair offer considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
