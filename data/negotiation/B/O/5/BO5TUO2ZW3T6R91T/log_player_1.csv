Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my desired profit. I believe there's room to negotiate further, especially since I know the product holds more value to him. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,125,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $1,100,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my original ask, I need to consider the risk of losing the deal altogether and only getting $1,000,000 from John.  I'm also running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and a sale, which is more important than pushing for a few extra dollars and potentially losing the deal entirely."
