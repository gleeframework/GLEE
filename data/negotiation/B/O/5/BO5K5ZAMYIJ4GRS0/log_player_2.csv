# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $135 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to me and its significance to you. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While Alice is asking for $135, it's still less than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer achieves this goal."
