"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still keen on acquiring this product, but I'm really pushing my budget at $1,120,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000, but that's my absolute final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,110,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,115,000, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm open to one more negotiation, but I need to see some movement from your side. What do you think?",1115000.0,Alice,7,
