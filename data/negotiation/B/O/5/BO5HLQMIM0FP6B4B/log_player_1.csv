**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has now offered the same price twice and stated it's his final offer.  There's a risk he will walk away entirely if we push further. Accepting the $1,150,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000) and avoids the potential loss of the deal entirely."
