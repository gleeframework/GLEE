Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $1,450,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating, but he's still trying to get a better price than her previous offer.  He's also getting closer to his limit, so he needs to strike a balance between being firm and being flexible."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1475000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again to $1,475,000. He's getting closer to Alice's last offer, but he's still trying to save some money.  He needs to decide how much he's willing to pay to avoid buying from John. If he doesn't get a good deal in the next few rounds, he might have to accept John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best possible outcome for Bob. Alice's offer matches his maximum price for the product, and he can secure the product without needing to rely on John.  There's no risk of getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds, and he saves the potential cost of negotiation."
