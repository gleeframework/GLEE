"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1500000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $670000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",670000.0,Alice,7,
