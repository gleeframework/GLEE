Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly and positive message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is your minimum, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $102. This still allows me to stay within my budget while showing appreciation for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While a little less than what I was hoping for, $102 is still above my minimum and a decent compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Bob, and selling to John would only net me $100."
