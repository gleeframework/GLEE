Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $10,000 to him and $8,000 to me. It gives Bob a good deal, while ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,800 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $9,200. This is a compromise, offering Bob a lower price than my initial offer but still significantly higher than his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer. Although $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further to show good faith, but I'm confident that the product's value to Bob justifies this price.  This should be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum value, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 than risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
