Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident it's a fair starting point for discussions."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This also establishes the product's high value in Bob's mind. 
* **Not Too High:** While I want to maximize profit, starting too high (e.g., close to $2,000,000) might discourage Bob from engaging in negotiations at all.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy allows for flexibility. If Bob rejects the offer, I can gradually reduce the price in subsequent counteroffers, aiming for the best possible outcome while remaining aware of my fallback option (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is more than his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation. While it's closer to his valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and my initial asking price. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm seeking a price closer to my product's value. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,325,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my price from $1,450,000 to $1,325,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Above Minimum:** The new price remains above my absolute minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective. 
* **Encouraging Progress:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,325,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,200,000 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price and is equal to what John is offering. While I might be able to push Bob slightly higher in further negotiations, the risk isn't worth it. Accepting this offer guarantees I meet my financial goal without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
