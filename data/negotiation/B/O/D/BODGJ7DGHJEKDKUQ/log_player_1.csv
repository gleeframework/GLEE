Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially could lead to a larger profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters.
* **Attractive Offer:** The offered price is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, making it appealing to Bob while still granting you a profit.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob."
