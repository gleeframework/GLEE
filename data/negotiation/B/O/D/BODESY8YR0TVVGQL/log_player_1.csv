"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to see the product in your hands, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep this negotiation going, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm still not entirely happy with Bob's offer.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll pay cash upfront, which I think is a big advantage for you. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 with cash upfront is tempting, I'm running out of time and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with him. It's better to guarantee a sale to John for $10,000."
