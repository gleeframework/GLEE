Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to create a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to $1,300,000 - $1,400,000, which is still a significant profit for you.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, this approach will be less effective."
