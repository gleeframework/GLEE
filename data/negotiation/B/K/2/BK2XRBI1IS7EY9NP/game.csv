"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm looking for a price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the price, but $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $13,000? That's the best I can do.",13000.0,Bob,6,
