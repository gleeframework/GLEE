"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I think this is a fair starting point.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $400,000?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $550,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $450,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me.  $500,000 is getting close, but I need to be a little closer to $450,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $475,000?",475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, but I'm still not willing to go below $500,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $495,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",495000.0,Alice,7,
