Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $875,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $875,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you might offer a price closer to $800,000."
