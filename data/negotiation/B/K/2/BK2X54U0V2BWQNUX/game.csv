"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this quality, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,450,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet at $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our two prices?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
