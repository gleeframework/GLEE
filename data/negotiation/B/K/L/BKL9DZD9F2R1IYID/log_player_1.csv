Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** Offering a price of $120 first sets a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely the final price will be closer to $120 than if you started at, say, $90. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counteroffer is too low, you can always politely decline and sell to John for your guaranteed $80."
