"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, close to my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm not going all the way to $15,000 because I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,000, a significant drop, but still higher than Bob's offer.  This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating flexibility, but still staying above my minimum.  This is a substantial counter-offer, and I'm hoping it will entice Bob to consider it.  If he rejects, I'll have to weigh the remaining rounds with the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price.  The risk of selling to John is still present, but I'm going to try to push for a higher price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant reduction in my price. With only 3 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the potential sale to John. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough to Bob to get a deal done, but I'm also ready to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is too high.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
