Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price within the ZOPA that maximizes your profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept. Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:**  $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's below your guaranteed amount but significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the price, even if Bob is aware you have another buyer.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the deal's value for Bob can make it more appealing.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you anticipate Bob being a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly more moderate price. 

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or has concerns."
