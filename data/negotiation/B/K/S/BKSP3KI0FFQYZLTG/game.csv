"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to squeeze the last bit of savings out of this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
