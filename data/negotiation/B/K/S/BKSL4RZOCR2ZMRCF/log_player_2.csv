Alice is coming closer to her value, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $9,000 as possible.  While I might be able to get the price down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting at $8,800 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
