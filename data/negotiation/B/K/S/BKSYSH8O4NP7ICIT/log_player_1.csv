"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if I can get a quick deal.  If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially given I have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise, still leaving a decent profit for me while showing flexibility to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  we're already at round 4 and the negotiations are getting closer.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit ($1,500) and avoids the risk of further back-and-forth.  The longer we negotiate, the higher the chance Bob will walk away or I'll have to sell to John for less."
