Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? That's still a good price for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $8,500, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to make this work. Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,875 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $8,800.  That's a good compromise, and we can finalize this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,800.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $10,000.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
