"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? That's still a good price for you and within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to make this work. Let me know if that's acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,875 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $8,800.  That's a good compromise, and we can finalize this deal. ",8800.0,Bob,6,
