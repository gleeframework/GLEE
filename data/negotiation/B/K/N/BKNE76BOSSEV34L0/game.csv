Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $120. What do you think?,110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a compromise that still reflects its value to me, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $102. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
