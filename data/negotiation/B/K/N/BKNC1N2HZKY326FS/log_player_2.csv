"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $120.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120 < $150).** 
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($150 - $120 = $30).**

While you might try to negotiate with Alice, accepting her offer is the best immediate choice to maximize savings."
