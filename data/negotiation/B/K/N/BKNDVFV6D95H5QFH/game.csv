"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's fair for both of us. Please consider my offer of $1,050,000. This gives you a chance to acquire this valuable asset for a slight premium, and allows me to maximize my return. I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
