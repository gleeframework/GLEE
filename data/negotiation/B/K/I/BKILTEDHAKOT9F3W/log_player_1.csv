Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter with a lower price, giving you room to bargain and potentially land somewhere above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you haven't invested significant time or resources specifically courting Bob. If you've already put in considerable effort, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic.
* Consider Bob's personality and negotiation style. If you know he's very price-sensitive, you might want to adjust the initial offer down slightly."
