"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $10,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer of $10,000 since his maximum budget is $8,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

While $9,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. Rejecting and counteroffering again allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal without risking overspending."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,200 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget.  I'd like to offer $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still committed to purchasing the product, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,900.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We appreciate your commitment to the product. In light of our discussions, we would like to offer $8,950 as the final price for the product. We believe this reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price to $8,950, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
