Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more.
* **Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal. Here's how:

1. **Start High:** Begin with a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate down.
2. **Justify Your Price:**  You need a reason for the high price, even if it's just the product's uniqueness or your unwillingness to sell it cheaply.
3. **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  His response will tell you how much he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its rarity and the value it holds, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for something this exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is significantly above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone implies you're open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his responses. If he flat-out rejects the price, you might need to come down closer to his $1,200,000 valuation, always keeping in mind your own bottom line."
