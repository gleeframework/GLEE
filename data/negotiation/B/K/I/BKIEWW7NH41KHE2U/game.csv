"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs. My initial price for the product is $1,200,000. This reflects the high value I place on it, while also leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this revised price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and  I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I propose a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
