Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm not comfortable paying that price. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for it. This is my best offer, and it's still a significant amount of money. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum and I have a guaranteed offer from John. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
