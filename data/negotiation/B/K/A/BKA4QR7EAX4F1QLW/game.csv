"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $92.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can make this work.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $88, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $90. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",90.0,Alice,5,
