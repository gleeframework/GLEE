Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start by aiming slightly below our guaranteed sale price with John ($100). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A price of $95 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested,  while still securing a profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique opportunity.

This strategy maximizes the potential profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
