"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my range. I'm ready to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable considering both our needs.  Let's find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
