"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, so let me know what you think!   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation round."
