"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to seriously consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I think I can get. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,200,000 because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm concerned that he's just trying to push for a very low price.  I've already rejected several offers below my minimum, and I'm not confident that I can get a significantly better price from him.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get a price that's at least my minimum."
