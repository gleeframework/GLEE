"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in making this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While it's a good starting point, I want to try and negotiate a lower price. I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I believe will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000 which is closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high. I want to see if I can get her down further before I commit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is a compromise that I believe will work for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's within my budget and a good deal for me considering I'm still saving $525,000 compared to buying from John. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating, but I'm concerned that Alice might be unwilling to go lower and I risk losing the deal.  It's time to lock in this price and avoid the risk of walking away empty-handed."
