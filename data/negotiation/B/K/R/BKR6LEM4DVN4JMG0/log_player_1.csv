"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a floor price of $8,000, and I can always walk away and sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, accepting $5,000 would be a significant loss for me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves me room to make a profit. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my floor price, I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a significant drop from my last offer and is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'm choosing to sell to John for $8,000. This ensures I don't lose money and gives me a guaranteed sale."
