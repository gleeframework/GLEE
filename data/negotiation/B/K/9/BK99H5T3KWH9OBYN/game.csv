"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $900,000. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers,  let's try $1,350,000. This price still allows for significant profit for you and a fair value for my product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
