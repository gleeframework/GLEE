"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a fairly aggressive starting point, but it allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $8,000, I'm not going to accept his first offer. I'm going to try to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible but still trying to get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard. I'm going to accept his offer and move on."
