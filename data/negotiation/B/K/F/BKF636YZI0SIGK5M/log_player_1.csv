Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** You want to maximize your profit, so starting with a higher price ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($15,000). 
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.
* **Potential for Success:** While $19,000 is ambitious, it doesn't immediately seem unreasonable. There's a chance Bob might be willing to negotiate in this range, especially if he perceives high value in the product. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards during the negotiation process, but it's harder to increase it after a low initial offer."
