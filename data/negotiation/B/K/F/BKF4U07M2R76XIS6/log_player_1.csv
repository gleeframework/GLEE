Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's a price that's significantly lower than what I value the product at ($15,000), but still higher than what Bob values it at ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.
* **The message is positive and persuasive:** It highlights the value of the product for Bob and frames the offer as a good deal.
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * Maximize my chances of Bob accepting the offer, as it's still a good deal for him.
    * Secure a decent profit if Bob rejects, as I can then sell the product to John for $15,000."
