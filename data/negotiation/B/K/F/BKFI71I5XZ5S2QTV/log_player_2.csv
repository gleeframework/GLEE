"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make a serious offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's first offer and seeing if she's willing to come down in price."
