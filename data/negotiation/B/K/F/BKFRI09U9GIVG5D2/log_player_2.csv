Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.

It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original price.
