"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $800000. This is my final offer, as I have another option to buy at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another option at $800000, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a compromise at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move forward with my other option.",800000.0,Bob,4,
