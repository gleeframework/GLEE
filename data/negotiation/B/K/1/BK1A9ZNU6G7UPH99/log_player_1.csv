Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I know you'll find incredibly useful. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Negotiation Room:** The higher starting price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to still secure a price higher than John's offer."
