Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is still higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it might be tempting enough for him if he values the convenience of getting the product immediately. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
