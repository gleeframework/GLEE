Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is $8,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding his valuation.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly suggests the price is justified, even if Bob isn't initially aware of that value.
* **Exclusivity:** By framing it as a ""pre-public listing"" offer, we create a sense of scarcity and urgency. 
* **Alternative:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't want to go below this price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, we maximize profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** We have room to go down to $10,000 while still profiting.
* **Bob Rejects:** We sell to John at our desired minimum."
