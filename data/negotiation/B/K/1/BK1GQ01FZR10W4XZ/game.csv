"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $750000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $875000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
