"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $78 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
