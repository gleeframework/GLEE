Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $120, we can see how interested Bob truly is. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, we can always fall back on our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than $120, potentially motivating Bob to buy before someone else snatches it up.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a safety net with John's offer."
