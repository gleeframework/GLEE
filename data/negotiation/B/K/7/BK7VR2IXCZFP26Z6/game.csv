"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",13000.0,Bob,6,,
