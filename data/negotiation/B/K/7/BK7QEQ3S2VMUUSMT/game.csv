"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $100. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $125. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $122.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $122.50. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $125, but I'll throw in a special bonus worth $5. That way, you'll get an even better deal. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully before making your decision.",125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $125. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for that price",120.0,Bob,8,
