"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the opportunity for both of us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to Bob's desired price. It's more prudent for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
