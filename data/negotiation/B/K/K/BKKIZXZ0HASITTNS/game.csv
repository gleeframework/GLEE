"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the opportunity for both of us to reach a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value it brings to the table.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
