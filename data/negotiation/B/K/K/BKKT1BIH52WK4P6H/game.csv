"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
