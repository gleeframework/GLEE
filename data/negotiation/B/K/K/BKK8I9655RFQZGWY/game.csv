,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're on a budget, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $100. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, so I'll counteroffer at $105. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,7,
