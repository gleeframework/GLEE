Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product to me. What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this price will allow us to both walk away satisfied.
