"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product to me. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this price will allow us to both walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $1,275,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's try to find common ground.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
