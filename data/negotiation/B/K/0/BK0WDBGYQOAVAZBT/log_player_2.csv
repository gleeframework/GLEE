"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, paying $1,200,000 is a bad deal. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let's see if we can shake hands on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my ideal price of $1,000,000. However, since I know I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I have some leverage to negotiate further with Alice.  I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account the negotiations we've had so far. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to go with John's offer.  It's a sure thing and saves me $75,000."
