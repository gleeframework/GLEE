"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $75? I'm ready to buy if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
