"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly more than my $80 limit and what John is offering. By rejecting and countering, I have a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This strategy aims to see how much Alice is willing to move from her initial price. 
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable.  I don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the price closer to my $80 limit. This counteroffer starts the process of working towards that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice meeting in the middle is a good sign, showing she's willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is still above my $80 limit. I'll reject and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to $80, but leaving myself some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $75? I'm ready to buy if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to compromise, but staying below my $80 limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""I'm ready to buy"", I'm signaling that this is a serious offer and could close the deal if Alice accepts.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):** While $75 is my target, I've left a tiny bit of space to potentially go up to $78 or $79 if Alice pushes back a little."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. While $85 is close to my $80 limit, I've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80. It makes more sense to go with the sure thing at this point."
