"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower.  Rejecting her offer allows for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount of $3,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's genuinely interested in selling, she might counter with something closer to my offer. If she rejects, it will give me information about her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting again allows me to potentially get a better price. I'll need to analyze her counteroffers and adjust my own strategies accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my desired price.  While I could potentially squeeze out another $200, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. There's a good chance she'll reject my next counteroffer and we'll be back to square one.  Accepting her offer ensures a deal and saves me $1,800 compared to buying from John."
