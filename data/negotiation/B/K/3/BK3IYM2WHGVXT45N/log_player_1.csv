Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm starting with a high offer, just below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $120, I still have room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal.  It's only $5 below my starting point and is getting close to what I'm aiming for.  There's still a chance I could get more, but it's risky to keep negotiating.  I don't want to lose the deal and be stuck selling to John for $100."
