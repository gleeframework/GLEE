"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $675,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $675,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $125,000 compared to John's price. 
* **No guarantee of better price:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice backing out or pushing for a higher price. 

At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
