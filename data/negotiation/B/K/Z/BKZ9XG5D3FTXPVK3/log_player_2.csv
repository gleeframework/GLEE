Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below what I can consider. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the significant value of this product while still being a good deal for you. I'm confident this will be a win-win.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $900,000.  To save money and avoid a potentially longer negotiation, it's best to buy from John at your established limit of $800,000."
