Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, and my minimum is $1,000,000, starting significantly higher gives me room to negotiate and understand his position better. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm open to discussion, signaling I'm willing to adjust the price.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's ""potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing its true worth to me.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will indicate how much he values the product and how aggressively he'll negotiate.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts a price close to my initial offer, it's a significant win.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** Starting high allows me to make concessions strategically and guide the conversation.

Remember, I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation, and accepting his offer now would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table.

By rejecting and countering, I can:

* **Signal my Bottom Line:** My counteroffer will demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but not at an excessively low price. 
* **Encourage Bob to Move Closer to His Value:** He might be lowballing initially.  My rejection may prompt him to offer a more reasonable price in the next round.

I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal than $600,000, especially knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below what I can consider. To be fair,  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $200,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the new price is still above my minimum and leaves room for further discussion.
* **Emphasis on Value:** By stating this price reflects the product's true value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth without directly referencing his own valuation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation going and encourages Bob to respond with his thoughts and potentially a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Move Towards a Mutually Beneficial Price:**  I'm aiming for a price between $800,000 and $1,100,000.
2. **Maintain Control:** While I'm making concessions, I'm doing so strategically and avoiding drastic price drops. 
3. **Keep the Door Open for Negotiation:** I'm signaling my willingness to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we are still pretty far apart. To be honest, anything above $700,000 will be tough for me. I could do $700,000 if that works for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased to $700,000, it's still below my $1,000,000 minimum. More importantly, Bob stating ""anything above $700,000 will be tough"" likely means he's willing to go higher, and his offer isn't his final position. 

I'll reject this offer to:

* **Push for a Higher Price:** There's clearly room for negotiation, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000 or higher.
* **Avoid Settling Too Early:** Accepting now would mean leaving potential profit on the table. 

I'll use my next counteroffer to encourage Bob to move closer to his true valuation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I also have a strong alternative with John, giving me leverage in this situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the significant value of this product while still being a good deal for you. I'm confident this will be a win-win."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Strategically):** This offer appears to be a compromise, but it's carefully calculated. It's $200,000 less than my previous offer, showing substantial movement on my part, but still a significant amount above Bob's current offer.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value, keeping it top-of-mind for Bob as he considers the offer.
* **Creating Urgency and Positivity:**  By saying ""win-win"" and aiming for a quick resolution, I'm suggesting this is a fair deal and encouraging a prompt decision from Bob. 

This offer:

1. **Increases the Likelihood of Acceptance:** It's a strong move towards Bob's likely maximum, making it attractive.
2. **Maintains Profitability:** $900,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum. 
3. **Preserves the John Option:** If Bob rejects this, I can still walk away and accept John's offer, though I'm optimistic this offer will be compelling enough for Bob to accept."
