Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $120? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to get at least $120.  I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $118. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product."", ""product_price"": 118} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $118 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $116. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm worried about running out of time and having to sell to John for $150.  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and $116 is close enough to my desired price point to make it worthwhile."
