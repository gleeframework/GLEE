Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

This is a high offer, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It also positions me to potentially get closer to my ideal price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This counteroffer is my minimum acceptable price, given that I can easily sell the product to John for that amount.  It also gives Bob a reasonable starting point for further negotiation if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to negotiate further at this point.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price, and I don't want to waste any more time.  It's best to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation."
