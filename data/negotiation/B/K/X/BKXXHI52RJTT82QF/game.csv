"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $950,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line, but I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000  as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
