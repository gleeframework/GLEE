"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $80? I'm really interested in this product, but that's all I can afford right now.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit over my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is really pushing my limits, but I'm genuinely interested in the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $95.  I'm really eager to get this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
