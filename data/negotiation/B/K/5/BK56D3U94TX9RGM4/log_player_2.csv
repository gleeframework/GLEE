"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your max price:** $120
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **John's price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price and you risk losing the deal entirely."
