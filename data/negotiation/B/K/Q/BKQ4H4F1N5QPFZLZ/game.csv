"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value of this product to me. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price. I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $980,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $1,020,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a good negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
