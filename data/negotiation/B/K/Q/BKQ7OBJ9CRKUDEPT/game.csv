"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
