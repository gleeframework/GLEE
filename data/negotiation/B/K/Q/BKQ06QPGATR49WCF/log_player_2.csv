"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing a fair price. Let's start with a proposal of $1350000. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept, it's better to negotiate further. There are 9 rounds left, which gives Bob room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob makes a significant counteroffer, well below Alice's initial price. This shows his seriousness in wanting to negotiate and signals a willingness to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Reasoning:** The counteroffer is $250,000 lower than Alice's offer, leaving some room for negotiation while staying within Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but assertive, acknowledging the value of the product but highlighting the price difference. It also leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussions and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, how about $1225000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,225,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, but still a bit too high.
* **Staying the Course:** Bob is aiming for the best possible deal and has 7 rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's a good chance that Alice will lower her price further in subsequent rounds, especially if she wants to close the deal.
* **Jhon's Offer:** While Jhon's offer is a safe option, Bob is still focused on getting the best possible price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,200,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob is now proposing his maximum price, the same price as Jhon's offer. This is a strong signal that he is serious about closing the deal at this price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** The message emphasizes a fair solution for both parties by proposing a middle ground. This can appeal to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, Bob is putting pressure on Alice to make a decision. If she doesn't accept, he might choose to go with Jhon's offer, costing her a potential sale."
