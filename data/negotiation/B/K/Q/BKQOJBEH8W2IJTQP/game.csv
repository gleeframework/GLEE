"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,350,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. This is my final offer: $1,450,000.  It's a fair compromise that allows you to get a good deal and me to get a price closer to what I need.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
