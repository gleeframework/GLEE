"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. It's certainly a tempting price, but I'm looking to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $900,000 to $825,000, which is a significant drop. This is a good compromise and a fair price, considering my goal of saving as much money as possible. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a lower price than John's offer."
