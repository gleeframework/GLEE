Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum threshold. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,750,000. It's a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still not ideal. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,500,000.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if Bob is serious about making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's increased offer but still keeps the price closer to my desired range. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable offer that Bob will accept, allowing us to reach an agreement."
