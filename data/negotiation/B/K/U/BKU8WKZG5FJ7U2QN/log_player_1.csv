"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you would be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and Bob's potential interest to create a positive starting point.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a cautious approach by starting with a high price but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also setting the tone for a collaborative conversation rather than a hard-sell, which could lead to a more positive outcome.  

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay up to $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  While it's closer, it's not yet a good deal for me.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to carefully consider how much I want to lower the price while still maintaining a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $13,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've lowered my price from $15,000 to $13,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price and encourage him to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the ""great deal"" reinforces the idea of a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. By moving closer to his price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on a price that is still acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with $11500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** While it is tempting to accept as I'm running out of time, it's not a good deal for me. 
* **I have 6 rounds left.** This is a critical moment. I need to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $10,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Risk:** I need to consider if Bob is serious about getting the product and if there's a chance he will increase his offer. 
* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise, but I need to be strategic with my price to avoid losing too much value. 
* **Selling to John:** If I don't see a clear path to a better price with Bob, I'll consider selling to John to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go a little further to reach an agreement.  How about $11,750? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this discussion."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:** I've made a small concession from my previous offer of $13,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Reason:**  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" and ""time invested"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It aims to find a middle ground while minimizing my loss. If Bob rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy and consider selling to John, as I'm getting close to the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I would like to counter with $11500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are down to 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **No Significant Progress:**  Despite my efforts, Bob's offers have remained within a narrow range, and I haven't seen any indication that he's willing to go higher. 
* **Risk of Losing Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck at a price below my minimum. 

**Decision:**

Selling to John for $10,000 is the most logical choice. It guarantees me a sale and prevents further risk of losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob. While it's not my ideal price, it's a secure option given the limited time and lack of progress with Bob."
