I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $125?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $125, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we try $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still not comfortable with $135, but I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, and I really hope we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to meet you at $137.5, but that's as low as I can go.",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand we're close but $137.5 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. ",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we try $138?,138.0,Alice,9,
