"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, he can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise that still gets you a fantastic deal on this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While he could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. Given that John is willing to sell the product for Bob's desired price, it's the most financially sensible option to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
