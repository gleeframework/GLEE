Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we do $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

At this point, Bob's offer matches John's offer. There's no further room for negotiation to make a higher profit. It makes the most sense to sell to John now and avoid further back-and-forth."
