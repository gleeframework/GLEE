"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price.** You're aiming for a price below $1,200,000, and $1,000,000 is still too high. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You know Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 (since her value is $800,000). 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.**  By rejecting, you can attempt to get a lower price from Alice.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still higher than the price you're aiming for.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has moved closer to your price, indicating she's flexible.
* **Rejecting allows for further counteroffers.** You can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.

**Next Steps:** You should make another counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get the price closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,020,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
