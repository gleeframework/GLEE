Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,500 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, we want to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above our minimum. 
* **Appear Confident:** By stating a value higher than our asking price, we project the product's value to Bob.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to find the right balance between an attractive offer for Bob and ensuring we get a price significantly above our minimum. A price too high might scare Bob away, leading us to John's offer."
