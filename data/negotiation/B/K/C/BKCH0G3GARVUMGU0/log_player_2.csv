 You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer is the best option. You can then make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $105. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $110 is the best you've gotten so far. While you'd prefer a lower price, you are willing to pay up to $120. Accepting the offer is a good choice, saving you $10 compared to buying from John."
