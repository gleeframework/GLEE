"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $8,000.** You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.
* **John's offer is your absolute limit.** This gives you a clear benchmark for how low you should try to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffering gives you the opportunity to secure a better price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum value of $8,000. This gives her room to negotiate while keeping the deal attractive for me.
* **Strategic Message:** I'm acknowledging her offer and being polite, but clearly stating my position and willingness to negotiate. 

Let's see if Alice accepts this counteroffer or wants to make another one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my target price of $8,000.** While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.
* **I'm comfortable with counteroffering again.** I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial offer but still stay below $9,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but also that I'm flexible.

I'll try to negotiate a price closer to $8,500,  knowing that John is my backup option if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise.  
* **Splitting the difference:** This creates a sense of fairness and can be psychologically appealing to Alice.
* **Staying below my limit:** The offer is still well below my maximum of $10,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 

Let's see if this counteroffer gets us closer to a final agreement!"
