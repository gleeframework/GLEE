{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $95 is close, but you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $85 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $85, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price of $85, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to reach a price that is more beneficial to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $88?  That's a good compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still within your budget of $100.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings of $2 are not significant enough to risk losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John for $100."
