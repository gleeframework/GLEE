Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 would be fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, Alice aims for a price higher than that but lower than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept before losing the opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* If Alice wants to absolutely guarantee the highest profit ($1,200,000), she should simply sell directly to John without approaching Bob. However, this approach aims to potentially secure an even higher profit."
