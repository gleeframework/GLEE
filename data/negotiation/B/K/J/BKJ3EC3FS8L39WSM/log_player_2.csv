Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $160?

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay more than $100, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $120 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I am still willing to pay more than $100, but $140 is still pushing my limit. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping an eye on John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum budget of $100.  I've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiation and it looks like we're at an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
