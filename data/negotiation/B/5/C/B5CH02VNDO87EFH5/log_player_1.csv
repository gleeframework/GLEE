Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, there's always room for negotiation. Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" you subtly anchor the price to a higher perceived value.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping the price significantly above his valuation.  

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  You are prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob since you have a guaranteed buyer in John. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
