Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Factor:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $50,000 difference allows for some give and take in the negotiation, without immediately jeopardizing my desired profit. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about if we aim for $850,000? This would still allow you to gain a good profit while ensuring I get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counteroffering.  
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  Let's aim for a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives you a substantial benefit and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain by acquiring the product. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and to the point, focusing on the key factors.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose too much in this negotiation.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  I believe $900,000 is a fair price that could lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $875,000? This price respects both of our interests and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial solution.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my target, $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counteroffering again.  
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation and allows me to take the risk of rejecting Bob's offer.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, aiming for a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit too far off from what I need to move forward.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further by lowering my price from $900,000 to $925,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This price is closer to the middle ground between my last offer and Bob's.
* **Reasonableness:**  I emphasize that the price allows me to make a reasonable profit, strengthening my position.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's finalize this deal"" adds a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $925,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it allows me to explore if Bob is willing to close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. I'll try one last time. How about $890,000? This price still gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to secure the product at a reasonable cost.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my target, $890,000 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  There's limited room for further negotiation without significantly impacting my profit margin.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,000,000, providing a reliable and lucrative outcome.

**Conclusion:**  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I achieve my financial goals without further risk."
