"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about if we aim for $850,000? This would still allow you to gain a good profit while ensuring I get a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  Let's aim for a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives you a substantial benefit and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $875,000? This price respects both of our interests and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still a bit too far off from what I need to move forward.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. I'll try one last time. How about $890,000? This price still gives you a healthy profit margin while allowing me to secure the product at a reasonable cost.",890000.0,Bob,6,
