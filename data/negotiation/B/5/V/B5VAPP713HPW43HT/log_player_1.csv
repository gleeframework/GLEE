Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price accurately reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($12,000) risks insulting Bob or making him think the product isn't as valuable."
