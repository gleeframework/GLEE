"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which matches Bob's offer. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure the desired amount right away with John."
