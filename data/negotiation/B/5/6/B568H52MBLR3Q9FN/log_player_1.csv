Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you, and it's the maximum I can offer at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
