Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $1,400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a significant amount. Since I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000, I think I'll choose option 3 and sell the product to John. I'll get a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000, which is better than the potential profit from continuing to negotiate with Bob.
