"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $900000.

"Alice, your offer is a good start, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm also aware that John is offering the same product for $800000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hesitant to go above $850000.  While I understand the value you place on the product, I'm confident that $850000 is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that works for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $880000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for you.
