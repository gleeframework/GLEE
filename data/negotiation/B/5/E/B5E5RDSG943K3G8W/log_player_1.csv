"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm going to counter with $980,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can secure a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $965,000 is a solid price and significantly higher than my floor of $800,000. While I could try to push for more, the risk of Bob walking away or getting a lower price from John outweighs the potential gains."
