"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
