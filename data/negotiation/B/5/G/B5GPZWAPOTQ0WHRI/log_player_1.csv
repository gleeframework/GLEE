Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to build some initial interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, showing willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.
* If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still potential to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to increase the price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it's the best I can do at this time.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob that this is a good deal by highlighting the discount from my original offer. 
* **Open to dialogue:** I'm asking for his response, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I secure a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether his counteroffer is closer to my desired value, or if it's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
