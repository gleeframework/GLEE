Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $1,200,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential,"" you provide a basis for the high price without directly revealing your minimum acceptable amount.

**Outcome Possibilities:**

1. **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a $400,000 profit beyond your minimum.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** You have space to lower the price slightly while still staying above your $800,000 floor.
3. **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
