{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's, in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $125.  This is a good compromise and gets me closer to my initial asking price.  It's better than selling to John for $120."
