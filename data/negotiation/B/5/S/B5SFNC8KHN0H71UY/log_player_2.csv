"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get from someone else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
