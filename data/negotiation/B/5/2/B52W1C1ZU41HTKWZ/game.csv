"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
