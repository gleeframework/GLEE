You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John, so it's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go higher, and we have 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals our strong desire to negotiate and sets the stage for a back-and-forth. We're aiming to find a middle ground, ideally closer to our desired price point, while keeping in mind the potential of switching to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial offer, but still too high for our target.  We're only three rounds in, and we can afford to keep pushing for a lower price.  Continuing the negotiation gives us more leverage and allows us to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing that we're willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a good middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current offer. We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle and signal that we're serious about closing the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly lower than her previous one, but it's still significantly higher than our target. With 5 rounds left, we can afford to continue negotiating. We're aiming for a price closer to $550,000, and there's still room to bargain.  Continuing the negotiations might lead to a better deal than accepting Alice's offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, we need to make a more substantial move to avoid reaching the deadline without a deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than our target. However, with only 3 rounds remaining, we need to be careful.  We're getting closer to John's price, and the risk of ending up with no deal is increasing. We'll counteroffer again to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our counteroffer again, demonstrating willingness to compromise. This offer is close to Alice's latest offer, signaling our desire to reach an agreement before time runs out. With only two rounds left, we need to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. This offer is still significantly lower than John's price, but it's a risk we're willing to take to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final round.  Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer, and we've already rejected it once.  There's no guarantee that we'll be able to negotiate a better price in this final round.  Given the limited time and the risk of ending up with no deal, it's more prudent to accept John's offer, which is still within our budget.  While we'd prefer a lower price, it's a safer option than risking a complete failure to negotiate."
