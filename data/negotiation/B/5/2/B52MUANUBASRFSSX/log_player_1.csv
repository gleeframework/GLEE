Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fair Justification:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on Bob's perceived value, hoping to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing the negotiation to proceed.

**Strategy:**

* **Plan A:** Bob accepts my initial offer. This is the ideal scenario, maximizing my profit.
* **Plan B:** Bob counter-offers. I'll assess his counteroffer and counter again, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer. 
* **Plan C:** The negotiation stalls, or Bob's counteroffers are unacceptable. I'll move to John and sell for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  Even though it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify selling.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I have no reason to settle for less at this point. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming to find a compromise. However, if the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers remain too low, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for his initial price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows good faith and encourages compromise.
* **Focusing on Benefits:** I'm emphasizing the ""benefit"" for both of us, which might make the price more acceptable. 
* **Keeping Option Open:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm also ready to sell to John if Bob's final offer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it still falls short.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to further price reductions, potentially dropping below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a reliable buyer who offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on John's offer.

**Decision:** I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure a guaranteed profit and minimize the risk of further negotiation."
