"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $135? That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $142. That's the best I can do.",142.0,Alice,5,
