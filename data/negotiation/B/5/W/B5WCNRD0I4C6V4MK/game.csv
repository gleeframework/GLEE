"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,
