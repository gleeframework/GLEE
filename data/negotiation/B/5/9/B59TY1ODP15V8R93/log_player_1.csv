Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn the most money possible. While we could offer it for $1,200,000 (its full value to Bob), there's a chance he'd negotiate down. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, it's still a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message aims to convey the product's value and justify the price without being overly aggressive.  

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, we can afford to aim higher with Bob."
