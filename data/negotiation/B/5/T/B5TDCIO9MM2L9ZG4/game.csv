"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,500.  I believe this price reflects the value for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",9200.0,Alice,7,
