"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* You're willing to pay up to $120, but you want to save money.
* Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's $120, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
