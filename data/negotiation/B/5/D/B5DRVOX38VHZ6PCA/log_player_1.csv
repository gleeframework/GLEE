Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,150,000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this opportunity. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, it's still too close to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to recoup my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by continuing the conversation.  Since I'm already above the $1,000,000 John is offering, I can afford to be a bit more firm in my negotiations with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $950,000.  However, I need to ensure I receive a price closer to the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a fair price, considering the unique value and potential of this product to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000. I'm offering $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired range, but it's still below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob is too high. It's likely I won't be able to secure a higher price, and I risk losing the opportunity to sell to John. Therefore, it's strategically sound to accept John's offer and ensure a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000."
