"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to recoup my investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
