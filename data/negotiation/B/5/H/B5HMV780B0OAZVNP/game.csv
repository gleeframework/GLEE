"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
