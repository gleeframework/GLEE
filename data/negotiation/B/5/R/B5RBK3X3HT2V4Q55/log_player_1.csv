"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing the win-win nature of the deal to encourage Bob's cooperation.
* **Not too aggressive:** While I want to maximize my profit, I also want to keep Bob engaged and avoid an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers. I want to see if I can reach a more favorable price with Bob. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate but not conceding too much. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:**  ""Middle ground"" implies a win-win situation, encouraging a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, so I'll offer $1275000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **More negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds left, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. I want to try to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,275,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000 as a final concession. This reflects the value the product brings to you, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob.
* **Value-based argument:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Closing language:** ""Let's close this deal"" emphasizes the finality of the offer.
* **Strategic price:** $1,325,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, which is another $25000 off from your last offer. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $1,300,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We're already in round 6, and there's no guarantee Bob will come up further.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  The potential of getting a better offer is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely.

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
