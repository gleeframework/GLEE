"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more to get the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $160, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150, Bob's offer of $145 is getting closer to that, and we're already in round 4. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by rejecting his offer. It's better to secure a profit of $25 rather than risking getting nothing from Bob and having to settle for $150 with John."
