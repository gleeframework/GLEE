Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves potential profit on the table. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as high-value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is firmly within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""benefits,"" you provide a basis for the price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a more generous offer might be considered.
