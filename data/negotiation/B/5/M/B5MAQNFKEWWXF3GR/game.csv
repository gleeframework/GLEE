,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $88?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $88 just yet. I'll meet you halfway from $92, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.50. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",90.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to pay $89.25 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",89.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already met you halfway from $90.50 and then from $92. I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price.",90.0,Alice,7,
