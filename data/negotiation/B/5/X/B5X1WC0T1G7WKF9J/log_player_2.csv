"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This product holds immense value and significance, not only to us but also to you, given its worth of $1,200,000 to you. After careful consideration and strategic planning, we propose to offer this remarkable item to you at a special price of $950,000. We believe this offer strikes a balance between fair market value and a reasonable profit margin for us. We understand the importance of making such a decision and hope that this proposal aligns well with your expectations and financial considerations. Should you choose to accept this offer, it would be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties. If you require any further information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to reach out. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you know John will sell it for that price.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a significant markup from her $800,000 valuation. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or simply buy it from John at your maximum budget."
