"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
