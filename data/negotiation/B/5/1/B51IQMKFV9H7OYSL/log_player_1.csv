{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $15,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's not too high:**  It's important to avoid scaring Bob off with a ridiculously high price right away. 
* **It sets the tone:**  It shows that you value the product and are confident in its worth.

You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, you'll need to decide whether to lower your price or try a different approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum of $12,000. While you could sell to John for $12,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're not willing to settle for such a low price.  This opens the door for a counteroffer where you can aim for a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price from $15,000 to $13,000. 
* **Highlight Value:** You emphasize the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify the price. 
* **Openness:** You encourage further negotiation by saying ""Let's see if we can find common ground,"" which keeps the conversation going.

This counteroffer balances your need to earn a decent amount with the desire to keep the negotiation alive with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $11500?  I think that's a fair compromise that shows we both are willing to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still lower than your minimum of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering the following:

* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort.
* **Potential:** There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a higher price from Bob, especially if he's firm on his offer.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a guaranteed sale for $12,000, so you're only losing $500 by accepting Bob's offer.

In this case, it's strategically better to accept Bob's offer. You'll still make a decent profit, and it saves you from potentially losing time and energy in further negotiations."
