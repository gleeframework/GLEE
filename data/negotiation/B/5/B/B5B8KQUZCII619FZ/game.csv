"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I think it's a fair price considering the value to me.  I'm hoping you'll accept it.",800000.0,Bob,4,
