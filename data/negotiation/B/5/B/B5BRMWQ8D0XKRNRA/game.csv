"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a valuable asset worth much more than that to me, but I believe it will be equally beneficial for your business. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the value I place on this product. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  However, $950000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1025000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975000 still isn't enough for me to move forward.  However, I recognize your desire to close this deal.  I'm willing to meet you at $1000000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for your business.  I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I won't go above this price.",975000.0,Bob,8,
