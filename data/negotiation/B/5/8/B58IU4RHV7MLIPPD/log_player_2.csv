Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above $10,000. She's compromising, but slowly. It's unlikely she'll drop to a price that beats John's offer within the remaining rounds.  Cutting my losses now ensures I get the product at the best price."
