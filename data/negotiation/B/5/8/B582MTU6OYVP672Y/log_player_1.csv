"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, aiming to gauge Bob's potential interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's worth and want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me, especially since I'm confident the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price considering the value of the product. I'm trying to find a middle ground to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe the product's value warrants a higher price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering again with $1,600,000. This is another compromise, but I'm feeling the pressure as the rounds go by. I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for Bob to consider, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum, I'm running out of time. It's likely that Bob is playing a game of attrition, hoping to wear me down. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John.  I'm not comfortable risking further negotiation with Bob, as I might end up with a lower price or no deal at all."
