"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good investment for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This shows my genuine interest in your product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
