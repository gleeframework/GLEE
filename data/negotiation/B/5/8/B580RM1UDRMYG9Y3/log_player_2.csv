"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a truly unique opportunity with tremendous potential.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also well within my budget, ensuring I don't overpay.  By expressing interest while proposing a lower price, I hope to initiate a productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my budget, it's still a significant amount of money, and I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I'll reject her offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This shows my genuine interest in your product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest proposal. It demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. I've emphasized my genuine interest in the product to encourage Alice to consider my offer seriously."
