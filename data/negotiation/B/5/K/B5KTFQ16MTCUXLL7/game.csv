"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
