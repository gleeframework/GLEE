"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will lead to a more reasonable price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500?  This is a fair compromise and still leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. However, it's closer than her initial offer, so I'm willing to continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for a lower price that both of us can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering my absolute maximum price, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but also setting a firm boundary. This hopefully pushes her to accept the offer, as it's closer to her desired price than buying from John."
