"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $18,000. It's a great opportunity to own a valuable item that's worth a lot to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to offer $6,000 to be fair.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, $12,000 is still too high. I could potentially go up to $7,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and seems fair given the circumstances.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway again at $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
