Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate could lead to a faster sale than waiting for John.

This strategy aims to secure a price that's beneficial for both parties while prioritizing Alice's goal of maximizing her earnings."
