{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, there's potential to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  $950,000 is still within Bob's budget and offers a substantial saving compared to Alice's initial price. This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for further bargaining."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save more money. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal.  Continuing to negotiate offers a better chance of securing a lower price, especially with more rounds remaining.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation process moving forward."

Offering $1,000,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming for a price that fits within his budget. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate but also has a firm price point."
