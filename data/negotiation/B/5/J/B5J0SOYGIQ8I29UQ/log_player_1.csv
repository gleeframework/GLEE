"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him, and we can close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. While I would ideally get closer to my initial asking price, this is a solid deal that allows me to make a good profit.  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price isn't worth it."
