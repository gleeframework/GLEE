"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I have a few rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $10,500?  That would still give you a great deal, and it's fair to me.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,250 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and it seems like Bob is being reasonable.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by being too stubborn."
