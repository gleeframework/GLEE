Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $10,500?  That would still give you a great deal, and it's fair to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.
