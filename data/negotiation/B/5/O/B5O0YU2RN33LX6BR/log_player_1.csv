{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is above your minimum of $120 but below Bob's maximum of $150, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving you with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120 and is a good compromise. It's likely that if you reject his offer, you won't be able to get a higher price from him, and you risk losing the sale altogether."
