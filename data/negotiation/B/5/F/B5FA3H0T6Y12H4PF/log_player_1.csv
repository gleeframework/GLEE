"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $500,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial price reflects the true potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but $500,000 is significantly below its worth. Could you consider something closer to $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product has potential, $2,000,000 is still far beyond what I'm prepared to pay.  Could you consider something in the neighborhood of $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below what John is offering. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Bob will significantly increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you consider $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer signals flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By coming down more than Bob's increases, it might encourage him to make a larger jump in his next offer. 
* **Deadline Awareness:**  With half the rounds gone, a firmer stance now could lead to a more favorable outcome in the remaining time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're coming down, but we're still quite far apart.  I could potentially justify going up to $800,000 if this would be our final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is his maximum price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees the full $1,500,000, which is almost double Bob's final offer.
* **Time Saved:**  Accepting John's offer ends the negotiation process, freeing up time and resources. 

While there's a small chance Bob might reconsider if pushed, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer."
