"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $500,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial price reflects the true potential of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but $500,000 is significantly below its worth. Could you consider something closer to $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product has potential, $2,000,000 is still far beyond what I'm prepared to pay.  Could you consider something in the neighborhood of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffers, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're coming down, but we're still quite far apart.  I could potentially justify going up to $800,000 if this would be our final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
