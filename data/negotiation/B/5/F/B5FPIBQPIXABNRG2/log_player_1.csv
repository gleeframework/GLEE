Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer, but it also shows him that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is still slightly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is a good compromise and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $80. There's no reason to keep negotiating, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
