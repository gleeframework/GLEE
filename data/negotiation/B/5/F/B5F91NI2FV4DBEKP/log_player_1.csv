Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and highlights the potential for a good deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also prepared to negotiate, which is why I'm not starting at my minimum price.

I'm ready to adjust my price if needed, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves too difficult to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob has indicated he's willing to negotiate, so I can likely get a better price if I counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out entirely. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but I'll be prepared to walk away if he's unwilling to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a good profit margin for me.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product to reiterate the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Open-ended message:**  My message encourages further discussion and leaves the door open for Bob to make another counteroffer if needed.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep negotiations open and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of your product, but I am still hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $8,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I've already made concessions.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, where Bob and I keep haggling over a small price difference, wasting time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a dead end.

While I'd prefer to maximize my profit, selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It ensures a quick and certain sale at a price that is acceptable to me."
