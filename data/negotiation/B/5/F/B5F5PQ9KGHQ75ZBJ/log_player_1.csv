{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, but starting with a strong offer to Bob gives me a better chance of securing a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than Bob's proposed price but shows flexibility.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget but emphasizes the value of the product. It also encourages further negotiation by proposing a solution that benefits both parties.
* **John:**  I'm still keeping John in mind as a backup, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up to $1,050,000, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to push the price closer to my target. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a profit.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,150,000 represents a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my desired price. This is a calculated risk, as I'm hoping to close the deal without losing too much.
* **Message:** I've declared this my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept. This strategy aims to make him realize he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, encouraging him to take the deal.
* **John:**  While I'm aiming for a deal with Bob, I'm still keeping John in the back of my mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has offered $1,080,000, which is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to go ahead and sell to John.  This decision is based on the fact that I can secure a much higher price with John, minimizing my potential losses."
