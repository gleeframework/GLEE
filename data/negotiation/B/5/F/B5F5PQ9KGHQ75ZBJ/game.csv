"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can we compromise on that price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a profit.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
