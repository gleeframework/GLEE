I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,450,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Hopefully, Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, but I'm going to make one more counter-offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,350,000.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing that I'm still interested in selling to Bob. However, it's also very close to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm likely to sell to John."
