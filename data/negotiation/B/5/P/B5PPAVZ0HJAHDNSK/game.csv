"I appreciate the unique value your product offers, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a good starting point, it's significantly lower than what I'm seeking.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
