,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000.  That's still a great value for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $875,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down to $890,000 for a final price. This is a fair compromise considering your budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
