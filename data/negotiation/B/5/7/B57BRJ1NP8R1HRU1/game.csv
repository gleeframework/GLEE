"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen! ",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $1,012,500. This compromise reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away with a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,
