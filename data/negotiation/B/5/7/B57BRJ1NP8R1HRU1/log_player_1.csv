"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John immediately would secure a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I believe I can potentially do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my value. Selling to John would secure a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,012,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiations are getting frustrating.  Bob's offers keep coming in below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the chances of him reaching my price are slim. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
