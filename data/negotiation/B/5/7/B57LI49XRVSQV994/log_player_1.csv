"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,500,000 is better than my minimum,  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
