"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and has the potential to be a game-changer for you.  I'm confident it's worth a significant investment, and I'm starting with an initial price of $1800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $1500000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $1650000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $1400000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $1525000? This price represents a good compromise and ensures we both get a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the point where I'm willing to walk away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000. Can we finally meet at a price that works for both of us?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and we're definitely getting close to a deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more - how about $1475000? This is a fair compromise and a significant investment for you. Let's close this deal and make this happen!",1475000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1450000. I'm willing to meet you at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
