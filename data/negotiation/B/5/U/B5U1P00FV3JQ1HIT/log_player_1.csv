Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding the concept of the ""zone of possible agreement"" (ZOPA).  Both you and Bob have a range where a deal makes sense:

* **Your Range:** $1,000,000 (your minimum) to any higher amount Bob will pay.
* **Bob's Range:** Any amount less than $1,200,000 (his perceived value).

You want to aim high within Bob's range while still leaving him with a feeling of getting a good deal.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value. The use of ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a bit of psychological pressure.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It captures a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain of $50,000. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go.
* **John as a Back-up:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage. You don't have to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
