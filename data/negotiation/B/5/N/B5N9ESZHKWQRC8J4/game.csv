"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a great deal on this valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. While $1250000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping to land closer to $1300000.  How about we split the difference at $1275000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
