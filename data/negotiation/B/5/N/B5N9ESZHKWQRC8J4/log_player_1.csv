"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation and still ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Focus on value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that it's a great deal for him. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I want to explore the negotiation further to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but I'm not going all the way down to his price. I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize that my counter-offer is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.
* **Highlight value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain from owning it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room to negotiate upwards, especially considering Bob's initial interest and his willingness to increase his offer.
* **Risk of selling too low:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would secure a sale, but it would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping to land closer to $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference at $1,275,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counter-offer represents a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable deal.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  The price is still significantly above my minimum and allows me to make a good profit.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that this price offers a good deal for both of us, creating a sense of fairness and encouraging acceptance."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to consider your latest offer. I'll meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1275000, which is $1262500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price of $1,275,000. 
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.
* **Potential for a better offer:** There is a chance Bob may be willing to go slightly higher, but it's not guaranteed.

**Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
