Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price already. There's no room for negotiation left.
