Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1100000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1250000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both the product's potential and your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
