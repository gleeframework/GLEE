Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in your product, the price is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both the product's potential and your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
