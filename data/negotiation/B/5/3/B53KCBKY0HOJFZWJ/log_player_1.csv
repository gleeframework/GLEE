"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob. It gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I am not yet willing to accept it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and close the deal."
