You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant discount already. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above John's $8,000 offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $9,000, and I'm trying to save as much money as possible. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my target price."
