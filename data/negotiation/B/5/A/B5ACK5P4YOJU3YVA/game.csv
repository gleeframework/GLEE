"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. The product's value is truly in the $900,000 range.  Perhaps we can split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  Let's make this happen. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",875000.0,Bob,4,
