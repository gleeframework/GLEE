"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a significant savings for me and still a good deal for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to be flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground, so I'm counteroffering at $13,250. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $11,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,7,
