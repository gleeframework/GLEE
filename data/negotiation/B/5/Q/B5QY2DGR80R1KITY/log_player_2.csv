"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might be risky:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again.  He might end up paying more or going to John, who has a higher price.
* **Compromise is better than risk:** Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a worse outcome."
