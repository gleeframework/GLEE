{""product_price"": 16,500}

This is my starting point, and I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $13,000, as it's below my minimum value.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob was willing to pay $13,000, I'll increase my offer slightly to $14,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering my minimum value of $15,000.
