{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message increases the chance of a positive response.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob increases his willingness to pay.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.
* If negotiations drag on or become too frustrating, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle for anything below $120. 
* **I want to maximize profit.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **John is a safety net.** Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by lowering my price, but not by much.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer.
* **Building Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiations moving towards a potential deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale with a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum.**  $92 is still below my minimum of $120, and I'm not willing to sell for less.
* **I'm closer to my target.**  However, I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John is waiting.**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $92, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my goal. If Bob rejects again, I will likely sell the product to John."

```
