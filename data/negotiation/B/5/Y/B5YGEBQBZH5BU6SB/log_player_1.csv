Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but based on my budget, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $850,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
