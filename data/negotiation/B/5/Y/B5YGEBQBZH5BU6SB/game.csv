"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but based on my budget, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I appreciate your understanding.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $850,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet your latest offer at $925,000. I'd like to continue our discussion, so how about we aim for $900,000? This would allow us to stay close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
