"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a higher offer considering the product's unique features and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it fairly reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
