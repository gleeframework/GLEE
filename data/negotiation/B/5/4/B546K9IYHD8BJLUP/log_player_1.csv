Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the price is a ""fair reflection of its value,""  you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Alternative:** While you have John as a backup buyer, you don't want to rely on that. Securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the primary goal."
