"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to be reasonable, and $9,500 is closer to what I need. However, I'm still stuck with a small gap. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this -  let's do $10,000.  This is a final concession on my end, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,250 for the product. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to make this work. I'm going to make one final counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is my absolute lowest price, and it's a significant compromise for me. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",9750.0,Alice,7,
