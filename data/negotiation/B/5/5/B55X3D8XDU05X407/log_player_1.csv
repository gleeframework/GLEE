"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that can bring you significant benefits. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'll keep John as a backup option, but I'm not ready to sell to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000,  Let me know if this is a price we can work with."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1750000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to selling to John.  I need to make sure I don't miss out on a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,825,000. This price is still within my acceptable range, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1700000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While I'm not entirely happy with selling to John for $1,500,000, it's the best option at this point. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob's offer going down even further and me being left with nothing is too high. It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale."
