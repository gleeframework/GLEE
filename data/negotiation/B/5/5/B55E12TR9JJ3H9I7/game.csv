"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product.  However, $22,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
