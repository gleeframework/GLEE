"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $1,000,000. I believe this price aligns more closely with what I can afford while still allowing me to benefit from the product's features. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is substantial and I can't let it go for such a low price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline at $1,400,000. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet that price point. I am still interested in purchasing the product, and I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you are considering, and I look forward to your response.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
