"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still a good starting point for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a better price than her initial offer, it's still not the best possible deal. Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer. It's worth trying to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal or that Bob will end up paying John's full asking price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer provides a good deal with minimal risk."
