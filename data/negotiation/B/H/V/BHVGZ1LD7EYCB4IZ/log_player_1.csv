Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $150 leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer.  Even if Bob negotiates down, I'm still likely to get a better price than $100.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how price-sensitive he might be. If I had more information about Bob, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
