"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $1325000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our previous discussions.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $1280000 is below the product's value.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1270000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1270000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $1280000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. However, I need to consider the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to $1285000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1285000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
