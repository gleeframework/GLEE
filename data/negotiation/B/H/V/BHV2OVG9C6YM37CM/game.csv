"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
