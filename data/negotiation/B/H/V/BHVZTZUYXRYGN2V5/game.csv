"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $800,000? I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price, otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that it's still a compromise considering the product's true value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
