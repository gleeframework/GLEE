"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation space and sets a high baseline.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a price closer to my desired outcome.  If he rejects and his counteroffer is too low, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my initial offer. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident that I can get a good price.  I believe this offer is fair and will encourage Bob to continue negotiating. If he rejects again, I'll need to re-evaluate whether continuing the negotiation is worth the time or if I should accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer.  I'm starting to feel the pressure to get a deal done, but I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I still have some leverage, and I'm going to use it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.  We are getting close to the halfway point of the negotiations and I want to make sure that we can come to an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John, as I don't want to risk losing time and potentially getting a worse deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure to get a deal done, I'm still not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my desired outcome. I have a few rounds left, and I'm going to try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000.  I'm running out of time, and I need to find a way to close the deal. This offer is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.  If Bob rejects this, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John, as I don't want to risk losing too much money on this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I want, and we only have two rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of running out of time and getting a worse deal.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose any more time or money trying to negotiate with Bob."
