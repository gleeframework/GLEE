"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $22000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $19000, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $16000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $17500, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $16000, and that's my final offer. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might find a better deal elsewhere, so I'd like to know if you can meet me at this price.",16000.0,Bob,6,
