Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle on $1,150,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a mutually beneficial agreement.
