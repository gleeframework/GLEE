Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To accommodate your budget while still valuing the product's quality, I am proposing a final offer of $85 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At $85, Alice's offer is within your budget and saves you $5 compared to John's price.  It's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice at this point."
