"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, however,  $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be open to a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between value and cost for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price point, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $70? That would work much better for my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To accommodate your budget while still valuing the product's quality, I am proposing a final offer of $85 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,5,
