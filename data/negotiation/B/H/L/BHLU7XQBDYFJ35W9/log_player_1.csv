"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get more from Bob. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push the price higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$13,000 is close to what I want, but I think I can still get a slightly better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $13,250? This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely.  $13,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's also a lot better than John's offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
