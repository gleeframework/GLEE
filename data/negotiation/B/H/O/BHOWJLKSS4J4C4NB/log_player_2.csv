"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that allows you to secure a substantial profit. I'm confident you won't find a better deal. Are you interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's message is full of sales tactics, aiming to inflate the product's value in your eyes. 
* While her offer is lower than John's, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting the initial offer, you signal that you're a savvy buyer and might prompt Alice to propose a lower price closer to her actual valuation."
