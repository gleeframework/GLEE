"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, but I need to see some flexibility from your side as well.  This is a significant opportunity for both of us, and I believe a fair compromise is possible.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
