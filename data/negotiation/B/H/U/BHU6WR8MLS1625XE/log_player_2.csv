{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  He has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for his maximum price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and might encourage Alice to compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating. While he could buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate but still staying within his budget. This counteroffer should be a good compromise point.  He's trying to meet Alice halfway while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his maximum.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be stalling. Bob has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's safer to go with that option rather than risk further negotiations with Alice."
