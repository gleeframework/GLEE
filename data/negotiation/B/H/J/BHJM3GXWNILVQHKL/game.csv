"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,300,000. This price still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make sure I'm getting the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still not meeting my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this now.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us considering the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both show a bit more flexibility.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer $1,320,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1320000.0,Bob,8,
