Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for potential concessions without dropping below your minimum. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by getting the best possible price from Bob, while still having a fallback option in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it is still lower than your desired minimum. You have a better alternative with John, who is willing to pay $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter-offer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This counteroffer offers a compromise:

* **It's a slight concession:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're not giving away too much.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It communicates your expectations and leaves room for Bob to agree.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer while still keeping the option to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still looking to keep the cost below $11,500. Would $11,000 be possible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is adamant about keeping the price below $11,500, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. It's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob, who might continue to lowball."
