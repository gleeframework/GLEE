"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds and  while I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,800,000. Would you consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and while I respect the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,750,000 is cutting it too close.  How about we settle at $1,825,000?  That reflects my desire to make a deal while still acknowledging the product's true value.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a final price of $1,775,000. I hope this aligns better with both our interests.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
