I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) because I have a backup buyer in John. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from John. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $102.50? "", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. Could you perhaps lower the price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $97 is still too low for me, especially considering I have John who is willing to buy for $100.  There's no guarantee that we'll reach a deal with Bob, and it's not worth risking losing out on the guaranteed $100 from John."
