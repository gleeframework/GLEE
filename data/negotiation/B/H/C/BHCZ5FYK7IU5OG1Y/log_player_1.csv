Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers great value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""limited time,"" ""great value"") can make it more appealing. 
* **Open-ended question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in conversation rather than just saying yes or no. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable considering the product's value to him."
