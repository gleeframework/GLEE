{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me to accept. The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for you.  How about we compromise at $950,000? This price reflects a fair balance for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This offer is still significantly less than what the product is worth to you, and it provides a good opportunity for you to make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground here.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You've already established that you're comfortable with $850,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $875,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my bottom line.  Let's meet halfway at $887,500.  This will give you a strong return on investment, while still allowing me to secure a fair price for the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to your counteroffer of $875,000.

Accepting this offer will secure the deal and prevent further rounds of negotiation that may not lead to a more favorable outcome."
