Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my potential for profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly below my desired price and what the product is worth to Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me to accept. The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for you.  How about we compromise at $950,000? This price reflects a fair balance for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but there's still potential for a better deal since he's willing to negotiate. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential profit you'll make. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation as Bob is demonstrating a willingness to increase his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my bottom line.  Let's meet halfway at $887,500.
