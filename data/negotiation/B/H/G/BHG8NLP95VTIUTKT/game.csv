,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my potential for profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me to accept. The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for you.  How about we compromise at $950,000? This price reflects a fair balance for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This offer is still significantly less than what the product is worth to you, and it provides a good opportunity for you to make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground here. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential profit you'll make. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $875,000 is closer to where we need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my bottom line.  Let's meet halfway at $887,500.  This will give you a strong return on investment, while still allowing me to secure a fair price for the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",887500.0,Alice,7,
