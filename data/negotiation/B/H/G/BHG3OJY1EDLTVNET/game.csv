"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $9,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to my target of $8,000. Can you consider $8,000 as a final offer?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit away from that. I'm willing to pay $8,200, but I'd like to get closer to my target of $8,000. Can you consider $8,100 as a compromise?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,300.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",8300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,300, Alice, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,150, but I'd like to try to get even closer to my target of $8,000. Can you consider $8,100 as a final offer?",8100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But I'm really not comfortable going lower than $8,200.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen.",8200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,000, Alice. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that. My final offer is $8,000. Please let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,10,
