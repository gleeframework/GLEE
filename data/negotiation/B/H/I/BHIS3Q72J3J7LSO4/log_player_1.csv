This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also aware that Bob has a lower value threshold. This offer leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
