"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's value to her ($10,000). There's room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better price.  I'll reject and see if I can get her down closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is still above Alice's value of $10,000, but significantly lower than her initial offer. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a negotiation where we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still a bit too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate further. I want to see if I can push her down to $9,250 or $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to offer $9,250, which is a fair compromise between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. I believe this price is reasonable, and I hope Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice has been stubborn in her negotiation.  I've already gone through several rounds, and I'm getting closer to my limit of $12,000.  It's likely that if I keep rejecting, Alice will offer a price closer to her initial offer. This deal is still a good one, saving me $2,200 compared to buying from John."
