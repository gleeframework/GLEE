Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffers are increasing at a very slow rate, and he seems firmly anchored below $1,000,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,200,000 value and avoids further negotiation risk."
