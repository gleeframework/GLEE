Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,000,000 and might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Fallback Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no immediate need to sell the product quickly and that you're comfortable with the potential of Bob rejecting the offer."
