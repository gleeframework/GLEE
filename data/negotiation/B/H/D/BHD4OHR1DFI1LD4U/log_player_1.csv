{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price and offers a small saving for Bob compared to its actual value to him. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me leverage to aim high with Bob.

This offer balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to make the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
