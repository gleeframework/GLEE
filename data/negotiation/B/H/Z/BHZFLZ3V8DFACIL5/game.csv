"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I'm really interested in the product and I think we can work something out.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $127.50?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",127.5,Bob,4,
