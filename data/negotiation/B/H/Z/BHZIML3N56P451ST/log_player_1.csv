"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm starting the negotiations at $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a significantly higher offer than the minimum allows room for negotiation and explores Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium. It also establishes a strong anchoring point, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffers to be higher than they would be otherwise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,200,000 is a substantial profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates strong interest. Rejecting at this stage keeps the door open for further negotiation and the potential to secure a price closer to our initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to move things forward."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're still holding firm above Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to our desired range. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:**  By not drastically reducing the price, we encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially offer a counter that meets us closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's still invested in the negotiation. We are now only $150,000 away from our previous counteroffer. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to our desired price point. We are still in a strong position, and it's worth seeing if he'll come up further before considering accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a very competitive offer for something of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and our previous counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Value Assertion:** The language continues to emphasize the product's high value, justifying the price even as we negotiate. 
* **Urgency:** By framing it as a ""very competitive offer,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to accept before we potentially explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob has now offered $1,200,000 twice, signaling a potential price ceiling for him. Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions.
* **Time Investment:**  We've spent six rounds in negotiation, and while we have time, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob losing interest or the negotiation stalling completely. 
* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum, representing a 20% gain. Holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer might not be worth the risk of losing Bob altogether."
