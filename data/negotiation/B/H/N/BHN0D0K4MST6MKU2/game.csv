"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it's worth the same to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,550,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
