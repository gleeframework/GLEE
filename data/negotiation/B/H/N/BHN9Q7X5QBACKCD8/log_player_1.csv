Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal, let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer slightly below your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it at $140 makes it seem like a potential bargain compared to your guaranteed sale price of $150 to John. 
* **Encouraging a Response:**  The friendly tone and open-ended question encourage Bob to engage in the conversation, increasing the chances of a sale. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
