"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
