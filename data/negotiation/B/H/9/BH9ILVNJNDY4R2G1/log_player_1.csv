Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $9,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $200 for some additional support and services? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $9,350.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the extra support I'm willing to offer you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9350}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $9,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100

We've been going back and forth for a while, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum. However, we only have a few rounds left, and I'm worried we won't reach an agreement.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
