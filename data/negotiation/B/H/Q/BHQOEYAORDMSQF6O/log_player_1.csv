"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and you'll be getting it for a price well below its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much more. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer.  $96 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $96 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $120."
