"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and you'll be getting it for a price well below its true value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth negotiating with Alice since you can potentially get the product for less than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much more. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You're closer to your target price of $80, so a counteroffer is a good option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still within your budget and have more rounds to go.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer.  $96 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 96}
