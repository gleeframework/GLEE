"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and you'll be getting it for a price well below its true value. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much more. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is a good offer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $97.50. I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my last offer.  $96 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",96.0,Bob,6,
