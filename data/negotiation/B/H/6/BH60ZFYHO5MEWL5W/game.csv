"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750? I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up.  However, $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9000.  This allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm grateful for your flexibility. I believe $8875 is a fair price for the product. It's slightly higher than my initial offer, but I believe it reflects the value I place on it. Would you consider this offer?",8875.0,Bob,8,
