"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100. It's worth exploring counter-offers to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, so it's likely she'll counter-offer, but it establishes my firm price limit and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight improvement, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a price closer to my maximum of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $125?  That's a good middle ground and closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $125, which is still within my budget and represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also firm in my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference and settle at $140? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $140 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $130?  It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $130, which is closer to Alice's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping within my budget. I'm also emphasizing the idea of a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
