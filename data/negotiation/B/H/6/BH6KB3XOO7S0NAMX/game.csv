"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $125?  That's a good middle ground and closer to what I can afford.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference and settle at $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $130?  It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Bob,6,
