"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject the first one. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
