"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little to $100.  This price still allows me to get a decent value for my product. Let me know if you're interested at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're still talking.  $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $88 is only slightly lower than my previous counter-offer, it's still not high enough. I'm going to make one more counter-offer to see if we can reach a deal, but if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $88 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $92 for this last offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll unfortunately have to go with another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I still want to give you a chance. I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've already made several counteroffers and Bob is clearly unwilling to go above $89.  While $89 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal with John for $120 and guarantee a higher profit."
