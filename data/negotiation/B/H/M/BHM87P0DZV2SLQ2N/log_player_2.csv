"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept on the first offer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and rejecting gives you the opportunity to find out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a common negotiation tactic. This signals that you're serious about buying but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in the middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's last offer. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price."
