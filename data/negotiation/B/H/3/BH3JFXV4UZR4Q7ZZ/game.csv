"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $8,200 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,600. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,100. This is still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
