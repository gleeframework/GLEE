You have three options:

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. You can always buy from John for $80 if negotiations with Alice fail."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That way, we can both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5.

While Alice's offer is closer to your limit, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to see if you can get her down to $85."
