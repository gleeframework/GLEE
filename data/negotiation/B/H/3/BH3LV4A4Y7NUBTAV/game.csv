"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is great, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start this negotiation off at a more reasonable price? I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's only $50,000 above what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can close the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that benefits us both. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $725,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's make this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the value it holds for you. Let's find an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $750,000 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,7,
