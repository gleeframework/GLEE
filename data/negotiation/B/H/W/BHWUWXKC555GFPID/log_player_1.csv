Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, so let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I can do $98, and I think that's a very fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts now. It's unlikely he'll reach our $120 minimum in the remaining rounds. It makes more sense to take John's guaranteed offer."
