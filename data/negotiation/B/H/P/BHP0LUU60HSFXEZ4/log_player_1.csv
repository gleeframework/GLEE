{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm starting high, but I'm willing to negotiate down a bit if necessary.  I'm also setting the tone for a positive and friendly negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's better than selling to John, it still doesn't meet my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the cost under $12,000. Could you possibly lower your price to $11,500? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. It's not worth continuing the negotiation, as it's likely he won't budge further.  Selling to John is the best option now, as it guarantees me my minimum price."
