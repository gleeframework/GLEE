**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's very unlikely to go below $11,000.  We're on round 9, and while she might go down a tiny bit more, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. It's not worth the risk of her staying firm and running out of rounds, forcing us to buy at her price or from John at $15,000."
