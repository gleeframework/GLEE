"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,300. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a good profit while still accommodating your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. That's the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
