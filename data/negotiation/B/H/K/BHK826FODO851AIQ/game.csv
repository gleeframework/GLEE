"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope you'll consider this proposal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to move up. Let's find a middle ground:  $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered while acknowledging your interest.  I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my limit. To continue moving forward, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

I believe this offer represents a significant step from my side while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let's finalize this and get you moving forward with this unique opportunity.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
