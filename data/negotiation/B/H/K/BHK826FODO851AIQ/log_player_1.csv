"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially lead to a higher final agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds, allowing me to strategically lower the price while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Confident Demeanor:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his stated valuation, meaning he has no room to move upwards from there.  While I could accept John's offer right now, it's still early in the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is still within a range where I maintain a strong profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to counter Bob's lowball offer and prevent him from anchoring the negotiation too low.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to signal that I'm serious about reaching a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope you'll consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved up slightly, but his offer is still substantially below my minimum. While selling to John is tempting, I'm not ready to walk away yet.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially as we're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation.  I'll make another counteroffer to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to move up. Let's find a middle ground:  $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered while acknowledging your interest.  I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer is slightly more in my favor than a perfect split between Bob's current offer and my previous one. This maintains a firm stance while still suggesting movement.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message subtly creates a sense of urgency by emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit, hoping to encourage Bob to accept before I potentially reconsider and go with John. 
* **Strategic Pausing:** I'm avoiding large concessions in this round.  This allows me to gauge how much Bob is willing to move and avoid leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my limit. To continue moving forward, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and while Bob is making more substantial moves, he's still significantly below my minimum.  However, his latest increase and message indicate a stronger desire to close the deal.  I'll make one more strategic push to see if I can get him closer to $1,400,000 before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're both committed to getting this deal done.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,450,000. I believe this offer represents a significant step from my side while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let's finalize this and get you moving forward with this unique opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a smaller concession than before, signaling that I'm nearing my limit.  This price point maintains a healthy margin above my minimum while still offering a potential compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message reiterates a desire to close the deal quickly but without using aggressive language that might scare Bob off.
* **Conditional Acceptance:** Offering $1,450,000 sets a strong target. Depending on Bob's response in the next round, I'll decide whether to hold firm, negotiate slightly lower, or take John's guaranteed offer."
