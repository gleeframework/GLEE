# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800,000. How about $820,000?

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'd prefer to stick to my initial offer of $800,000 and see if she'll budge. I'm not desperate, and I have the option of buying from John."
