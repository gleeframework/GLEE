"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, and I believe it could be beneficial to you as well. I am offering it to you for $95, which is above its intrinsic value of $80, reflecting its significance to me. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $95 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is a fair price considering I could buy a similar product from John for $80. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I would like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $90 for the product. This still reflects its value to me while remaining within your budget. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50. This price is still within my budget and reflects the value you place on the product. Let's make a deal!",87.5,Bob,4,
