"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $100. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk Bob lowering his offer further in subsequent rounds."
