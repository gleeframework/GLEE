Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm happy to get $80 for the product, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I'm going to try and get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's only $5 less than my initial offer. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
