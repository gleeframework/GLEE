"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about $175? That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Can you try to meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $140 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $155. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you try to meet me at $145? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,145.0,Bob,6,
