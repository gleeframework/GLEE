Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired $115,  $108 is a good compromise. It's more than John is offering, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go any higher."
