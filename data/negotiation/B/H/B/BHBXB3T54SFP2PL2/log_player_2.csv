"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Not Too Low:** While I want to save money, going too low (e.g., $500,000) might be insulting and discourage Alice from further negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how motivated Alice is to sell and how close to her $800,000 valuation she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is a very fair offer considering the potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her offer by $50,000, showing she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Room:**  There's still a significant gap between her offer ($900,000) and both my initial offer ($700,000) and her product's value ($800,000).
* **Negotiation Leverage:** It's too early to accept. I have time and room to negotiate further without risking getting too close to John's $1,000,000 backup."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Splitting the difference between her current offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($700,000) signals a willingness to move closer to a deal.
* **Target Price:** $800,000 is her value point, and there's a chance she might accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Pressure Point:** By offering her value, it puts some pressure on Alice to justify any counteroffers, especially as I get closer to John's $1,000,000 alternative."
