"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that holds significant potential for your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. I understand its value to you may be higher, and I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your Maximum Value:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000
