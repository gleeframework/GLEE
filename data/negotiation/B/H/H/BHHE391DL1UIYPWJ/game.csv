"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be open to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. How about we meet in the middle at 110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference at $95?  This way, we both get a fair deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 95 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make sure I get at least 105 for my product. Would you be willing to meet me at 105?",105.0,Alice,5,
