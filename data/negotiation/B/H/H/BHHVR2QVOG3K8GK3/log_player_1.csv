Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your minimum:** You know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you.
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.
* **Potential gain:** By offering $1,500,000, you are attempting to maximize your profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially accept the offer. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** A higher price gives you a chance at a larger profit, but increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Negotiation room:**  A $1,500,000 offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Information is power:**  You don't know Bob's valuation, so it's better to start high and see how he reacts.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic approach, and the optimal price may vary depending on various factors like market conditions, Bob's perceived wealth, and your own risk tolerance."
