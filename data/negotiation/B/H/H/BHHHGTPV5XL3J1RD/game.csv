"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
