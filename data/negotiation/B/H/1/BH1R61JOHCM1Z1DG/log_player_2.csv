"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $15,500? This is my final offer, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be fair, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $16250. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made his final offer and Alice has refused to go lower. He's at a point where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a better price. With only five rounds remaining, the risk of not finding a suitable price is too high. Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
