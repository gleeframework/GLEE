"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150.
* **John's Offer:**  $150 is your maximum budget, but you can get the product for less from Alice.

It's always better to get a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
