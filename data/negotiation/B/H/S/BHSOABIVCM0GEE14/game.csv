,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delay.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,037,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1037500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to give up much more, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going below that. I think that's a fair price considering the value I know you place on the product. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
