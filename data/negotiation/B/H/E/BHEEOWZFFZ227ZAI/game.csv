"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and $1,000,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000 as a final offer.  This represents a substantial discount from the product's true value and gives you a good price.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
