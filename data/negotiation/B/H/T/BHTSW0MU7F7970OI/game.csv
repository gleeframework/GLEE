"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $16,000? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is closer to my budget. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $16,500? It's a small compromise, but it's the best I can do.",16500.0,Alice,5,
