"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000. A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $975,000 is actually higher than her previous offer, which means she's less willing to compromise.  However, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further exploration of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to pay a bit more than his previous offer, but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer. $900,000 represents a significant discount from John's price and might be appealing to Alice.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers have been steadily increasing, suggesting she's not willing to drop her price much further.  Bob is also approaching his maximum budget. At this point, buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best option.  While it's not the ideal price, it avoids further negotiation with Alice, which could result in a higher price or a stalled deal."
