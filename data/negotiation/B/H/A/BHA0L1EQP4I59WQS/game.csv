"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for me, while being more within your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep the price at or below $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,300,000 as a compromise?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
