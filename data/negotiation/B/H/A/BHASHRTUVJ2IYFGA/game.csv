"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? I am willing to pay up to $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product, but $500,000 is far below its true value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above a certain price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to meet the price of $750,000. I'm looking for a price closer to $600,000. Is there any possibility we could meet somewhere in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $600,000 is still significantly less than what my product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $700,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a middle ground. I'm still not able to meet the price of $700,000. I believe I can offer $650,000 which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",650000.0,Bob,6,
