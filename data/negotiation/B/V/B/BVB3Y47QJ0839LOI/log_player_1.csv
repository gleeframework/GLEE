"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I believe that price is a little high for me. I would be willing to offer $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That price is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay a significant amount over John's offer. While the negotiation is progressing slowly, there's still room to secure a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value here. $1,210,000 is my final offer - I think it's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1210000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer sends a signal that Alice is getting closer to her bottom line while still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob pushes back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation has gone on long enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. $1,192,500, take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,192,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,192,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is a strong return on Alice's minimum price. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
