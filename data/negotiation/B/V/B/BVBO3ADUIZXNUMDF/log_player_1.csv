Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with ""Let me know your thoughts,"" signaling a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging that Bob has the final say. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
