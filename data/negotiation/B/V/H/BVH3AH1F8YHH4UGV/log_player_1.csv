"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), you anchor the negotiation higher. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, even if it's above what Bob might have in mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for this product. I'm still very interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is already above his perceived value of $1,200,000. This suggests there's room for him to go higher.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $1,400,000 would be selling yourself short since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. 
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only round 2. Rejecting now signals that you're serious about getting a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is truly unique, and I need to ensure a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down from $2,000,000 to $1,700,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing technique often feels fair to both parties, even though it's still significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces why your price is justified.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While closer to your minimum, this offer still gives you some space to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but no higher. This is my final offer. I'm excited about the product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches what you can get from John. There's no financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **""Final Offer"":** Bob has indicated this is his best price, suggesting he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving you with no deal. Accepting now guarantees you the same amount as John's offer."
