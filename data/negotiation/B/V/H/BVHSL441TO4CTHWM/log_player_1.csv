Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 aims high but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.  This gives you some leverage.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or moving on to John."
