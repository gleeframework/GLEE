"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,050,000. How about $990,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $990,000 is still not workable for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to being comfortable with the price, but I'm still a bit short. How about $1,015,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing hard for a lower price, but $1,015,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,020,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
