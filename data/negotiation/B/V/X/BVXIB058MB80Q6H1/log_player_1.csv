"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** The message is designed to be polite but firm, inviting Bob's input to understand his negotiation style and willingness to pay.
* **Backup Option:**  We keep in mind that we have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, your starting price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below our initial asking price and still leaves a considerable profit margin on the table. We are aiming higher and believe further negotiation is in our best interest.  

While we have a guaranteed offer from John, we are confident we can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true worth of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We reduce our price from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm on Value:** We don't drastically drop our price. Emphasizing the product's value justifies the higher price point. 
* **Test Bob's Willingness:**  This counteroffer aims to see how much Bob is truly willing to pay and if he's approaching our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding our minimum by $300,000. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** Bob's negotiation tactic suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Time Value:** We've already spent four rounds.  Prolonging negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome.  It's best to secure a good deal now."
