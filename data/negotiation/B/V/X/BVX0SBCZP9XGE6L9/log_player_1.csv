Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a sense of getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still making a profit, and it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps Bob understand your offer and allows for quick negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9800. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,800 is still a bit too low for me, but it's getting closer to my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a final counteroffer. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $9900. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to go any lower and risk losing a significant amount of money. I've already invested a lot of time in this negotiation, and it's getting frustrating. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for my desired price. It's time to move on and avoid any further negotiations."
