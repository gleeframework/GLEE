Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.  A $50,000 reduction from her initial offer is a reasonable starting point.  If she rejects this, we can continue to negotiate down from here."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 740000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but keeping it below Alice's latest offer.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us, but I'm determined to get the best possible deal.  This counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to negotiating while also showing that I'm willing to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still determined to get the best possible price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a lower price.  I don't want to settle for a price that's not optimal, especially since I have the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 745000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a price that's within my budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our current offers and reach a deal in the next few rounds.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll consider buying from John in the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations, and Alice's offer is very close to my desired price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be left with no deal. Additionally, buying from John would cost me $800,000. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price that is only $50,000 more than my initial counteroffer, and it saves me the risk of losing the deal altogether."
