Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $15000 price point. I would like to make a counteroffer at $12000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
