"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a valuable asset that holds great significance for both of us. I believe we can create mutual value through this transaction. Considering its worth to you and the market value, I propose to sell it to you for $15000. This price reflects not only the current market conditions but also the potential growth and benefits it could bring to you. Let's discuss if this offer aligns with your expectations and financial planning.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $15000 price point. I would like to make a counteroffer at $12000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's worth to me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
