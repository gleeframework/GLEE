"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, and you have a guaranteed alternative at $8,000 with John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Buying from John ensures you pay the minimum possible price."
