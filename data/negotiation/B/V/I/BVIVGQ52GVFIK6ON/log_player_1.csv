Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, which gives you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussion, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than immediately rejecting the initial price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In reality, a more dynamic approach involving multiple offers and counter-offers might be more effective."
