"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for Bob and allows for potential negotiation.  If he rejects it, I have room to come down a bit, but I want to see if he's truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good amount, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give away too much just yet.  We'll see if he's ready to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has clearly indicated he's not willing to go higher than $1,000,000.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with him.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and I'm not losing any more time trying to squeeze out an extra few hundred thousand dollars."
