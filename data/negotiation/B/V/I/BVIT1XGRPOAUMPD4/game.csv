"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000.  I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
