"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can find a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
 
While $14,000 is tempting, I'm going to sell to John. I'm confident I can secure a better price with him, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation with Bob."
