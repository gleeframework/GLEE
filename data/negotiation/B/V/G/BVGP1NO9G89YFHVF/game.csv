"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
