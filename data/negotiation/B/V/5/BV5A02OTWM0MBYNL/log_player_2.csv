"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1200000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price and offers you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, but still higher than I'd like. Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, it's worth seeing if I can negotiate further. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
