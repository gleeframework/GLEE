"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired profit margin and my budget. Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure a profit closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and represents a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing this discussion."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000.  This price is fair considering your desired profit and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to sell for more, $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price and it seems Bob is unlikely to go higher.  This ensures a good deal for both of us."
