Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (You have a guaranteed sale with John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (If he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer. Aiming slightly below his maximum value increases your chances of a deal.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully assessed its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its true worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and value.
* **Price Justification:**  Implies careful consideration went into the price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob may counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Confidence is Key:**  Present your offer with confidence.  Believing in the value you're offering will make Bob more likely to accept."
