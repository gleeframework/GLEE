Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still allows you to earn a good profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to potentially accept a counteroffer if necessary. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes the offer easy for Bob to understand.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option of walking away and selling to John if the negotiation doesn't go in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $15,000.  You have a good chance to get closer to that by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you consider $9,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum price, $9,750 is still below your desired range.  You can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
