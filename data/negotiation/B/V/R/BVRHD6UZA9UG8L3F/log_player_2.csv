"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price and lower than Alice's value, it's still higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation. It also puts the price closer to John's offer, creating a sense of urgency without completely revealing my fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still a $500 difference. It's worth one more try to negotiate a slightly lower price before accepting defeat."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you consider $9,750? "",
 ""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($10,500) and my previous offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still $250 more than John's price.  While Alice's product might be slightly better, the price difference isn't significant enough to justify going above my $10,000 limit. It's time to walk away and buy from John."
