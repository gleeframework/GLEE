"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you consider $9,750? ",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,750 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
