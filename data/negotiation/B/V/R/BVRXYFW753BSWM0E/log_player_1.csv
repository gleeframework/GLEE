{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum price of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation. 
* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000.  While it's good that he's interested, it's not worth selling the product for that price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500** is a compromise price. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* The message is still friendly and positive, emphasizing that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob but am not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to make another counteroffer to try and get a price closer to $8,000. I'm also starting to feel like John might be the better option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to drop my price to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're able to come up to that. If not, I might need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,000** is my minimum price, and I'm stating that clearly to Bob.  
* The message is firm but still respectful. I'm letting Bob know that I'm serious about selling to him, but I won't go any lower.
* I'm also hinting that I have other options (John) to encourage Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $7800. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum price of $8,000. At this point, I'm starting to run out of time and patience. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price, and I'm not comfortable going lower. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiation.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer who will be willing to pay my asking price in the future."
