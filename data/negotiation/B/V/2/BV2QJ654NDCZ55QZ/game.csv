"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $150, which is fair considering the product is worth that much to you. Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a good deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
