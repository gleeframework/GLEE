"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $18,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which would be $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,800, but I can't go any higher.  This is still a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal!",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $9,800, which would be $10,275. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",10275.0,Alice,7,
