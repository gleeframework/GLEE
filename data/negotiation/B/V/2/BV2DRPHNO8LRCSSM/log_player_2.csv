"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $18,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and work out a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside of what you're willing to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal. You also have the option to buy from John at $8,000, which is still on the table. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which would be $10,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,750 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. You're still early in the negotiation process, and there's a chance you can get a better deal. Also, you can always go with John's offer of $8,000, which is your ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,800, but I can't go any higher.  This is still a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $9,800, which would be $10,275. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,275
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your preferred price, you've only got 3 rounds left and it's looking increasingly difficult to negotiate down to $8,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John at your ideal price, it's safer and more efficient to simply go with John's offer.  You avoid further negotiation that could potentially result in you having to pay more than $8,000."
