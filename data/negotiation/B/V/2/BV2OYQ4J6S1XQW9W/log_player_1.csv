Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a strong offer of $950,000, Alice anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and still allows Alice to potentially secure a deal significantly above her minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 

Alice is prepared to negotiate but has the safety net of John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both Alice's starting price and her minimum acceptable price. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's a wide gap in perceived value, but Alice knows Bob is willing to pay considerably more. By rejecting and counteroffering, Alice can try to bridge that gap without settling for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my initial asking price.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the product's potential to benefit your business."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** Alice stands firm by rejecting Bob's low offer, but demonstrates flexibility by decreasing her price by $50,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's value proposition, reminding Bob of its potential benefits, which might justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while still leaving Alice room to maneuver before approaching her minimum acceptable price. She's testing Bob's willingness to move closer to her range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I will consider the product's value carefully before making a decision. Based on my current assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While she could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is now relatively small.  

* **Good Return:** Accepting this offer secures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead Bob to reduce his offer, or even walk away. Accepting now guarantees the sale. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal quickly means Alice gets her money sooner. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer of $850,000 represents a favorable outcome for Alice."
