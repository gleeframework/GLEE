Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below our minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes Bob is reasonable and open to negotiation. If Bob is known to be a hard bargainer, we might need to start with a slightly lower price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If we need to sell the product quickly, we might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob."
