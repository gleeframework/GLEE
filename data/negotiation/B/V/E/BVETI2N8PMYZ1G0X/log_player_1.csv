Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Consider the Alternative:** Offering it for much less (close to John's $8,000 offer) leaves too much potential profit on the table.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer rather than letting Alice go to John."
