"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still gives me a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is dropping his offer, which makes me think he's not very interested in the product. However, I'm still not willing to accept $9,000. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so that's the safest option at this point."
