"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be open to that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit off on the price. I'm willing to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,500 is your bottom line, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I can offer it to you for $13,000, which is still $500 above your last offer. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make.",13000.0,Alice,7,
