Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I can offer it to you for $13,000, which is still $500 above your last offer. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $13,000 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
