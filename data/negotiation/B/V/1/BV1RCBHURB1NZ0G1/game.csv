"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure if $14,250 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,6,
