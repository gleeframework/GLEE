"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum threshold. This allows for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below it.  I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations with Bob. I believe that with more rounds, I can potentially secure a higher price, especially since he is clearly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm trying to close the gap by making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, while still staying above my minimum threshold. I'm also using language that emphasizes fairness and compromise, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not sure if $14,250 is the best price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming increasingly difficult. His offers are consistently below my minimum threshold, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that satisfies me.  I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it's important to consider the time and effort involved.  I'm confident that I can secure my minimum threshold with John, so I will sell the product to him."
