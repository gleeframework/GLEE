"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a good profit margin. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
