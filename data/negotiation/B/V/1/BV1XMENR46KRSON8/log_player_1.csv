Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I think it would be worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $125.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John acts as a safety net, ensuring you'll make at least $100. 

By offering the product at $125, we:

1. **Create a Win-Win:** Bob gets the product for $25 less than its value to him, and you make a $25 profit over your minimum.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** We start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation if needed. 
3. **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering it for anything less than $125 significantly reduces your potential profit, while going much higher risks Bob rejecting the offer outright."
