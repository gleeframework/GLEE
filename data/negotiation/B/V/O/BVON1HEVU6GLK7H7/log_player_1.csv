Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me the best chance of getting my desired price and avoids the risk of Bob making a counteroffer that's too low.  If he rejects, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what he initially valued the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,500. This is a compromise between my desired price and his offer.  It's still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good profit for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
