"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for Bob to get a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid. I'm  showing willingness to discuss further.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. I'll also consider the remaining rounds and my potential fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $90 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **More negotiation room:** I have 8 rounds left. This allows me to try and push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage in negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired $120. I will use this round to assess how motivated Bob is to buy and whether he is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to get closer to $105 for this product.  It's a unique piece and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my goal:** I'm increasing the price from $90 to $105, aiming for a more favorable deal. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness and its potential value to him.
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm using ""let's see if we can find a compromise"" to signal openness to negotiation while maintaining my price range.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects my offer again, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.  I'll also consider the remaining rounds and my potential fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $90. I hope you can consider this as a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $90 remains below my desired profit margin, and I'm still not willing to accept a loss on this product.
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating.
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:**  My ability to sell to John for $120 provides leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5.  I'll aim to stay firm but also consider whether to offer a slight compromise, perhaps a price between $95 and $100, depending on Bob's reaction in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a little, but I can't go lower than $95. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a small concession to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the quality and value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Finalization:** The ""What do you think?"" at the end shows I'm open to closing the deal if he agrees.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll watch for any change in his negotiation strategy. If he continues to stick to $90, I'll have to decide whether to accept or continue negotiating in the next round. 
* **Consider John's Offer:**  I'll keep in mind the security of John's offer and whether I'm willing to risk losing more rounds for a few extra dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $92 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** While $92 is still slightly below my desired $120, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  I have only 4 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing more time and potentially ending up with nothing if Bob becomes unwilling to budge.
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I have the safety net of John's offer if I need it. This allows me to take a slight loss and secure a sale.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on, knowing that I secured a profit despite not reaching my ideal price."
