"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. Would you be willing to accept this price?",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're agreeable.",800000.0,Bob,4,,
