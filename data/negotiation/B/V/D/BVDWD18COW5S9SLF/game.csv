"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's still below what it's worth to me, but allows for a good profit margin for you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows for a good profit for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $1,275,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without sacrificing too much. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than $1,275,000. Can you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling a bit frustrated with this negotiation. While I appreciate your persistence, I'm still not willing to sell for $1,225,000.  I'm willing to make one final concession and go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product and the fact that John is willing to pay $1,500,000. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
