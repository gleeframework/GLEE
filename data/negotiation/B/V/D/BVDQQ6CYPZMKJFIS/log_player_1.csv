Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,250.  Would you consider $9,150? This would be a fair compromise and a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to pay $9,125 for the product. This is a fair price considering your original asking price and my budget.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,125 is a good compromise.  It's close enough to my goal, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
