Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering you $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
