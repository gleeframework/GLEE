"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $712,500 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product to me while allowing you to make a substantial profit.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",712500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $712,500.
