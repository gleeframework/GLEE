"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal!",102.5,Alice,5,
