"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  However,  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
