Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit. If Bob accepts, you've made significantly more than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $120, this high initial offer opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer with a price that's still higher than your guaranteed $80 from John. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, you have a backup buyer (John) ensuring you won't lose out completely. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or price sensitivity. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer can lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
