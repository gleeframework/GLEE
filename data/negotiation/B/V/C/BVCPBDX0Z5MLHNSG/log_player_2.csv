"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to secure the product at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in Alice getting closer to her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal for Bob and avoids the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
