"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",14500.0,Bob,4,
