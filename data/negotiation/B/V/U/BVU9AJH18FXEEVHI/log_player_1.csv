Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. My asking price is $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $1,900,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. It allows room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be aware that pushing too hard could lead to Bob rejecting the offer."
