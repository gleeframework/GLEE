"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $120? It's still a significant discount from my original price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference - how about $100?  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I can't go below $105. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's make this happen, and I promise you won't be disappointed with the product.",105.0,Alice,7,
