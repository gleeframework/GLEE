"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Alice still makes a profit:**  Even though Alice is selling for $12,000, she is still making a profit of $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000).

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob as it allows him to save money and still acquire the product."
