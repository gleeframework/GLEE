Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation, giving you the opportunity to secure a better price while still being attractive to Bob.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit with maintaining a good relationship with Bob and keeping the negotiation process open."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000?

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement through further negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000, which reflects a compromise on both our parts.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer of $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems like we're reaching a stalemate, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome.  To guarantee I get my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
