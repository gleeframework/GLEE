# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is way too high.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me. How about $140? I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $100. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. How about $135? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, he's still willing to walk away and get the product from John for $100.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he should aim to secure a price closer to his $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $135 is still too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 130}
