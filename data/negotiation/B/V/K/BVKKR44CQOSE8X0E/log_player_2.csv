Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $650,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $675,000, which is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 675000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We've carefully considered your proposal and decided to respond with an offer of $685,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and we hope it aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $685,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $685,000, which is only $15,000 more than Bob's last offer.  It's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's a good value for Bob."
