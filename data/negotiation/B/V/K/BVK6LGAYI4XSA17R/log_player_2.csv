# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me, and I believe it would be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think!

You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price for the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10000 is below my minimum threshold, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $12000? This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value and my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's new offer is closer to my budget, but still a bit high.  I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can find a price closer to my target of $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
