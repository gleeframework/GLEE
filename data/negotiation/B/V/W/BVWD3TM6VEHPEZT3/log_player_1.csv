"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not starting at my absolute minimum, I'm leaving room for Bob to make counteroffers and for us to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only able to offer $950000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).**  Even though it's closer than his initial offer, I'm still not willing to settle for less than what I consider the product's true value.
* **I want to see if I can push for a higher price.** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **There's still time.** With 8 rounds remaining, I have ample time to negotiate further. Selling to John is a fallback option, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a significant saving. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting value and savings:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the potential savings he can achieve by accepting my counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, indicating that I'm serious about getting a price that's fair to me.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that invites further discussion and encourages Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is truly worth to me.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We've reached a point where the difference between our offers is relatively small. With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to push for a higher price and see if I can secure a deal closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, but if the negotiations fail, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $960,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $965,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer, showing a commitment to compromise and demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price that benefits both parties, reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer narrows the price gap significantly, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting and closing the deal. 
* **Last chance to negotiate:**  I'm still hoping to secure a deal close to my target price, but with only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to get closer to my fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  However, I'm still holding out for a better price.
* **Pushing for a higher price:** I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can get him to increase his offer again. 
* **Strategic consideration:**  While selling to John would secure my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to give up on a potentially more favorable deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $962,500 is still a bit short of what I need to accept.  To be fair to both of us, let's compromise at $963,750.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm again offering to split the difference between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing continued flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Finality and urgency:** I'm framing this offer as a final compromise, emphasizing the need for a decision to be made.  With only three rounds left, I'm creating a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, and it's a chance to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic positioning:**  While this offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's a strategic move. I'm hoping to close the deal before time runs out and I'm forced to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about it and am willing to offer $963000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $963,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are becoming slim.
* **Price is still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Securing my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  While it's not ideal, it's the most logical decision given the circumstances. 

At this point, the risks of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweigh the potential gains.  I'm confident that selling to John is the best option to secure a fair deal and avoid further delays."
