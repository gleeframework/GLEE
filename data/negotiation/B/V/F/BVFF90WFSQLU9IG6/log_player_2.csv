"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer because it's above your budget. You can always get the product from John for a lower price. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation and gives Alice some room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, and it's close enough to John's price that it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  You can get the product from John for a guaranteed lower price, so it's the most logical choice."
