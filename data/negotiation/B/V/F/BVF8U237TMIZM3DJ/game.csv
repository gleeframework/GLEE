"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could be persuaded to part with it for $925,000. This offer takes into account the true value of the product, which I believe will bring you a significant return on your investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've mentioned earlier. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
