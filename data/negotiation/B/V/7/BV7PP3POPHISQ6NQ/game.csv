"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000.  This is a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given my current market research and the potential for negotiation.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, but this is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a very good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which I believe is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
