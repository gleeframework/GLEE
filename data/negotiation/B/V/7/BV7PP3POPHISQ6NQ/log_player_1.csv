Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1800000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given my current market research and the potential for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
