Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
