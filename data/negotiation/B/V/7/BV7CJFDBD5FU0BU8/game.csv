"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy having it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $160 and $150, which is $155. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
