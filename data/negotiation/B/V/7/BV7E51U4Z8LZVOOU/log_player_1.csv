"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking $115 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while also ensuring I start with a profitable offer.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close the deal."""
