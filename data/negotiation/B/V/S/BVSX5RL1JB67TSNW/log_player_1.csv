{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. It's high enough for me to make a profit, but low enough to be potentially appealing to Bob. I also include a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true worth while allowing us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident you'll agree that this price is fair, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
