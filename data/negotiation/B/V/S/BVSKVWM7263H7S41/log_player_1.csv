"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? I think that's a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","While Bob's offer is lower than my initial ask, it's still a significant profit above my minimum.
