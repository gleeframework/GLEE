Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $18,000 is a fair price for this product and its potential value to your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. It's the maximum I'm able to pay, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is holding firm at his maximum price, which is our minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to move on to John and secure the $12,000 sale."
