Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $16,500, which is only $500 more than my last offer, and $1,500 less than her previous offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we're getting closer to a final price.  Accepting this offer is a smart move, as we've already gone through several rounds and we can still buy from John for $15,000 if we need to."
