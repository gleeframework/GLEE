"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $750,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
