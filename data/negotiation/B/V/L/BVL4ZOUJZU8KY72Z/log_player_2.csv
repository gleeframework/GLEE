"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you at a price of $60. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $60 is a decent price, there's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's worth seeing if she's willing to go lower before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $60 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price?"",
""product_price"": 45
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and Interested:**  I maintain a positive tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($45), I'm aiming to shift the negotiation in my favor.  Even if Alice doesn't agree to this price, it sets a lower point for future counteroffers. 
* **Strategic Lowball:** While $45 is quite low, it leaves room for me to gradually increase my offer over the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $60 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $55. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to inch closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $50? That would work really well for me."",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Alice's movement helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $50, demonstrating willingness to compromise but not jumping too quickly to her price. 
* **Clear Target:**  By stating that $50 ""works really well,"" I'm subtly anchoring this price as my ideal outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $52.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $52.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating in good faith and has come down considerably. $52.50 is a good price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling."
