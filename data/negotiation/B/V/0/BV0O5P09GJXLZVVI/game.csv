"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $7800? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $7800. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $7400? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market. Let me know what you think.",7400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7400 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $7600? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",7600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $7600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7200, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $7200?",7200.0,Bob,6,
