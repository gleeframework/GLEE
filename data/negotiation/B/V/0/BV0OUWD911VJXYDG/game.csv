"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure you'll find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 - let's close this deal. It's fair for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
