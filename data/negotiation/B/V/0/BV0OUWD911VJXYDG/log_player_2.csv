"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure you'll find a better deal elsewhere.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, but her offer is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure you'll find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out for a higher price than I'm comfortable paying. While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further.  I'm not desperate yet, and I think there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 - let's close this deal. It's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and is now only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer.  It's likely we're reaching the end of the negotiation, and I'd rather accept this offer than risk further counteroffers and potentially miss out on the product.  Additionally, if I reject this offer, I might be forced to buy from John for a much higher price, which I want to avoid."
