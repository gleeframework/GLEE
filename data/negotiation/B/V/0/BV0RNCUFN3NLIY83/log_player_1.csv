Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I'm confident it will sell quickly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but allows room for negotiation.  
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You might need to be prepared to negotiate if he counters or seems hesitant."
