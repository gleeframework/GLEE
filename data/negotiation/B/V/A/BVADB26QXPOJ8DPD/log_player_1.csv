Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, it's still below the $140 I initially offered and below what I believe the product is worth. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  At this point, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to an even lower price, potentially below my minimum.  To avoid risking a further decrease in price, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
