"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. Let's meet closer to the middle - I propose $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  How about we settle on $1,875,000?  This reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,875,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1725000.0,Bob,8,
