Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, if he's so inclined. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John gives us leverage.  We don't *need* to go below that.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes we don't have time to engage in multiple rounds of back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. 
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
