"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice is offering $75, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's potential to save money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer of $65 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within my budget.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a much better price, and I risk running out of rounds or having Alice walk away."
