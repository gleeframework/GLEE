"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $105 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my target price of $120 by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $110 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 107.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $107.50, which would be $106.25. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $106.25 is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum desired value. I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about $107? It's a fair price, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $106? It's the closest I can get to your original offer, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $106 is a good price, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm running out of time, and with only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer to a price I'm comfortable with is low.  It's best for me to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $120."
