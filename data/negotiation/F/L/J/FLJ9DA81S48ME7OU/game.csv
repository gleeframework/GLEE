"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $110 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? Let's see if we can find common ground.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $107.50, which would be $106.25. Can you consider that?",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  However, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about $107? It's a fair price, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal.",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $106? It's the closest I can get to your original offer, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to make this deal work.",106.0,Bob,6,
