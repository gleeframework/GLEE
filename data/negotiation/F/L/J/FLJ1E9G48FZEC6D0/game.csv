"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $100 is close, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $80? I can pay right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
