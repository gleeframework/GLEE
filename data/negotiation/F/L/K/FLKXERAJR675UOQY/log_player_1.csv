Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price. Can we meet at $90?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I think we can do better than that. Can we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Bob seems pretty set on getting the price close to $90.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his $90 offer is worse than selling to John for $100."
