Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $95. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'm not too thrilled about accepting his offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of my own. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $105. This is a bit higher than his offer, but still lower than the original price I was willing to sell it for.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:
