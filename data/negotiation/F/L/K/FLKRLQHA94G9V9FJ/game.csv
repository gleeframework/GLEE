"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about $120? That's a good compromise for both of us, and I can make a decision right now.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $120. I'm willing to compromise at $140, which is still a good deal for you, but also gets me closer to my minimum price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really trying to stick to my budget.  How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I can make a decision right now.",130.0,Bob,6,
