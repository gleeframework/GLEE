"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as much value as possible.  $14,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. I also want to encourage Bob to think about the value of the product to him, reminding him that he values it at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I can still make more money by continuing the negotiation. I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for me to increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about we meet at $13,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price. While I would like to push for a bit more, it's getting late in the game. Accepting $13,000 ensures a profit of $3,000, which is a good outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially with the possibility of selling to John for $10,000 looming."
