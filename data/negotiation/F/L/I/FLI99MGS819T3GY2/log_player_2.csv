"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is the lowest price Alice would be willing to sell at theoretically, since it's her perceived value. While she may not accept immediately, it leaves room for negotiation upwards while still being significantly below my alternative of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her lowest price.  $110 is a reasonable deal and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
