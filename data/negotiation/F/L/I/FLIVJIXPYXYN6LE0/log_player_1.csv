{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for you.
* **It's a reasonable initial offer:** It's not too aggressive, which could make Bob unwilling to negotiate further. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower your price slightly or try a different approach. You also have the option of going with John's offer if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
