"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider my revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 still leaves me a bit short.  I'm willing to come down to $10,400. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10400.0,Alice,5,
