"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $8,000.  Would you consider that?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a common tactic in negotiation to understand the other party's bottom line. I'm leaving myself plenty of room to increase my offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. How about we meet halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, $14,000 is still above my budget and what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm now proposing my maximum budget of $10,000. This lets Alice know I'm serious but also sets a firm limit.  It will be interesting to see if she's willing to accept a price that's lower than what the product is worth to her."
