,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is quite steep. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $8,000.  Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
