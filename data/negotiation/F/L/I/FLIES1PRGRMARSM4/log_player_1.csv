"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to kick off negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the high price (""true value""), which could be based on factors Bob might not fully know (e.g., market demand, unique features).
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer acknowledges that we're starting a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than my target price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up from your initial offer.  To be frank, $1,800,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. Could you do $2,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  I started by acknowledging Bob's movement to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial ask but still above Bob's offer. This signals that I'm serious about selling but not desperate. 
* **Open for Discussion:**  By using phrases like ""Could you do..."" I'm keeping the conversation open and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. How about $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a significant amount below my target. I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer since I have the security of John's offer. Bob seems motivated, so I think he might go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,900,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I'd need to see $2,050,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** I'm introducing a ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to make a move.
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** By stating ""to make this work for me,"" I'm implying that this is a bottom line without fully revealing my hand. 
* **Shifting Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting the decision pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm afraid $1,800,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,800,000 is his limit. It seems unlikely he'll budge further. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with a less favorable outcome. Selling to John now guarantees my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
