"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8750 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great price for such a valuable product.",8875.0,Alice,5,
