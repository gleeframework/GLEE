"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is within your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a much better deal with John."
