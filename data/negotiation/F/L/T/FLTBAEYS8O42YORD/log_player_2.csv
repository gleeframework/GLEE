"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I finalize a deal with another buyer.  While my asking price is typically above your stated valuation, I'm willing to consider a discounted price of $1,450,000 for a quick and decisive sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her typical asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum valuation of $1,200,000.  Bob can get the product from John for a price that fits his budget, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
