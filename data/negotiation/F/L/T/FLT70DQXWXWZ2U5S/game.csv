"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  This is a fair price, considering its value. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
