,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy with that deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
