You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's a clear sign that she's starting high, hoping to maximize her profit.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, starting with that price as your counteroffer sets a clear boundary.  It's highly likely Alice will reject this offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals your seriousness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and since you have 7 rounds left, it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price. It's time to increase your offer, but still keep it within your budget.  A counteroffer of $1,200,000  shows you're willing to compromise, but it's still a significant discount from her offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your maximum budget. However, there's still room for negotiation, and you have 5 rounds remaining. You want to try to get a price closer to $1,000,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is demonstrating willingness to negotiate. We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and it's time to make a more substantial counteroffer.  $1,300,000 is a significant increase from our previous offer, showing Alice we're serious about making a deal, but still leaves room for her to lower the price further.  We want to stay within our budget, but also be prepared to potentially buy from John if the price doesn't drop further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to be flexible, but the price is still above your ideal target. With only three rounds remaining, it's time to push for a lower price. While you could accept and buy the product for $1,450,000, there's still a chance to save more money by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation and need to push for a deal.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and a counteroffer of $1,350,000 shows that we are serious about reaching an agreement while staying within our budget. It's a fair offer considering Alice's previous offers, and if rejected, we can decide if we want to buy from John in the final rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in the final round of negotiations with Alice. While her offer of $1,400,000 is tempting,  we are still within our budget and have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer gives us one last chance to push for a better price, potentially getting even closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final offer and we're aiming for a price that's both a fair compromise and within our budget. 

* **$1,375,000** is a substantial increase from our previous offer, demonstrating our commitment to reaching an agreement.
* It's also a significant discount from Alice's last offer, leaving some room for negotiation.
* If Alice rejects this offer, we will have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000, ensuring we secure the product.

This final offer aims to push Alice to accept a price that is beneficial for both parties and avoids the need to go with John's offer."
