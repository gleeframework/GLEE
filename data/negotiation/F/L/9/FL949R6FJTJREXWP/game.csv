"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $7500 yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $8200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7800. I'm willing to compromise one more time and offer you a price of $8100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
