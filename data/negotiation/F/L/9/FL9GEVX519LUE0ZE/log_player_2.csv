Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $795,000. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm at $800,000.  At this point, saving $5,000 isn't worth the potential risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at our maximum price."
