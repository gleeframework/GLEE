"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a decent deal.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
