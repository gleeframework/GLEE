"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You can get the product for $1,150,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,200,000 you would pay John. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer achieves this goal."
