"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can save a lot more money than $1,200,000. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. It's worth negotiating further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also taking into account its worth to me.

You can still do better than $1,150,000. Continue negotiating and try to get closer to the $950,000 range."

Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I think I can do better than that. I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm willing to stand firm on this price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.

Alice is back to her original price, but you've made progress. It's worth one more counteroffer. You're close to a deal and don't want to risk buying from John at a much higher price."

I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.

While you'd like to pay even less, Alice is firm at $1,250,000.  This is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. You're saving a significant amount and securing the product you want."
