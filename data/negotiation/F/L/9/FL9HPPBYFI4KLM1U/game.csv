"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is worth to you. How about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also taking into account its worth to me.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I think I can do better than that. I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm willing to stand firm on this price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $1,100,000? That's a good compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  It's closer to your price and still saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I've already met you halfway and stood firm on my initial price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
