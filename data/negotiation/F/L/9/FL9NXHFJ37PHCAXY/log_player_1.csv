Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can lower the price, but I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to make a deal, I'm not willing to drop to $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair compromise. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to settle for $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from his position, and I'm not willing to drop any lower than $1,300,000. It's time to move on and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
