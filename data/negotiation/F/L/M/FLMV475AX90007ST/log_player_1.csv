Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This price is still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product, and it would be a great starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
