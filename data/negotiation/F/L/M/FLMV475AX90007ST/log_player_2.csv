"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This price is still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on the product, and it would be a great starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to find a middle ground, I propose we set the product price at $11,000. This acknowledges the value you see in the product while also providing a fair return for me. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's lower than the initial offer and lower than the price from John.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
