Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for explaining.  I know you're trying to get a fair price. How about $12,000? That's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go above $12,000. We've been firm with our $15,000 minimum, and he's only increased in small increments.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, so it's time to cut negotiations with Bob and take the sure profit."
