"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount compared to its value, but I believe it's a fair offer given our current discussion. Please let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try $825,000 as a compromise. This still offers a substantial discount on the product's value while being closer to your budget. I hope you'll find this proposal more acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
