"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $75 is too low for me. Could you do $95? That's a significant reduction on my initial price and would be a fair deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $85. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
