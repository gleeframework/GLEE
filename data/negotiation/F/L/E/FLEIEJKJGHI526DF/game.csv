"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. Can we meet in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while still giving you a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $12,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
