"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
