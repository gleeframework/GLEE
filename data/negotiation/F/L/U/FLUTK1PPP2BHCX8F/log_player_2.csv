"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate you being interested in the product, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

While $135 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100. You'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
