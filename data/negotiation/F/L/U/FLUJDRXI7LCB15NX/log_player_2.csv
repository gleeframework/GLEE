"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is still a good price for Bob. He's comfortable paying up to $10,000, and this offer is significantly less than that. It's also higher than Alice's minimum price, so it's likely she's unlikely to come down further. There's no guarantee Bob will get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and he could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a fair price."
