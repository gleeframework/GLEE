I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to counter with a price slightly closer to my minimum. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up just a little more. If not, I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'd prefer to get more, I've reached my limit with Bob.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  John is a reliable buyer, and his offer is a safe bet."
