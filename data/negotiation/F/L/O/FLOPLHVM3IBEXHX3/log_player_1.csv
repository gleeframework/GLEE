Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might discourage Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, framing it as an opportunity for Bob.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value but still leaves you with a substantial profit above your guaranteed sale price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Remember, your bottom line is $1,500,000."
