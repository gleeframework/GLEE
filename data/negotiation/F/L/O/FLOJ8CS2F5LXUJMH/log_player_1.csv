{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's attractive to both of us. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, but still secures a good profit for me.  I'm also keeping John as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but if the next round doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I'll likely sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
