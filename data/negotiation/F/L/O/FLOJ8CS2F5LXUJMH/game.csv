"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer you the product for $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
