"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see its worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
