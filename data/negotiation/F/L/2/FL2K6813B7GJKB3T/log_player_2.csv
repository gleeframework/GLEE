"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is my final offer on that price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice has indicated that this is her final offer.  Bob might be able to secure a better price if he continues to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to take a closer look at my pricing strategy and come back with a new offer. For now, I'll meet you at $15,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob is within his negotiating range and it's worth seeing if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $15,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  At this point, Bob has been negotiating for several rounds and it seems like Alice might not be willing to go lower.  It's best for Bob to go ahead and buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $12,000. This ensures he gets the best possible price and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
