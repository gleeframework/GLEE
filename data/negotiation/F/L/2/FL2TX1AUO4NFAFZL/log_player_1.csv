Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13,000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price and close to my desired price. It's worth it to close the deal now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
