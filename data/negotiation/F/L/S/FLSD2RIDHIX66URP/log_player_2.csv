Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $715,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $720,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While we could push further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'll end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting at $720,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
