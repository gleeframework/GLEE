"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely do better.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate and you want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if necessary. It also gives you room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $115 is still too high.  Since you only have 7 rounds left, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice you're serious about getting a lower price, and this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It demonstrates you are willing to be flexible but also still want to save money. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking Alice walking away entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price considering you have only 5 rounds left.  While you could potentially negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price within your budget and allows you to potentially buy other things later."
