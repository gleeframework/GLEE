"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm confident it's worth more to someone like you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no incentive to accept it because you can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice or find another seller who might offer a lower price."
