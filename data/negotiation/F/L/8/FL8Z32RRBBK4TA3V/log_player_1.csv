Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? This would still leave a good profit for you, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. I've done some research and I think I can get a similar product elsewhere for around $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $12,500.  How about we compromise at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to lose patience, Alice. I've made a serious offer of $12,750, and you've rejected it. I'm now willing to make one final offer of $12,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and consider other options
