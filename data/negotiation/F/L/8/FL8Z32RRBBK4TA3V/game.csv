"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? This would still leave a good profit for you, and it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. I've done some research and I think I can get a similar product elsewhere for around $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $12,500.  How about we compromise at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose patience, Alice. I've made a serious offer of $12,750, and you've rejected it. I'm now willing to make one final offer of $12,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and consider other options",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration.  However, I'm still firm on my price of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. It's our last chance to close this deal. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. ",13000.0,Alice,9,
