"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product's value,  $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
