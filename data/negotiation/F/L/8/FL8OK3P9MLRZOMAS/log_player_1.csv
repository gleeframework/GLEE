"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob is offering $7,500.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer is only $200 less than my minimum.  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, it's better to close the deal now than risk losing a sale and having to sell to John."
