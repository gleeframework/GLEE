"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but I'm hoping we can settle on a price that works a bit better for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'll buy it from you right now. Otherwise, I think I'll have to go with the other offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
