Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you say $13,500 is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $13,000.  That's already a significant stretch for me. Can we make this work at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,200. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one!  Alice is squeezing us. Here's how I see it:

* **Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,200.**  She's stated ""final offer"" twice now.
* **We're only $200 away from our ideal price.** John is a safe fallback, but saving an extra $200 is good.

I'm going to push it one more round, but with a clear signal that we're close to walking away:

**{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is really my limit. I can do $13,100, but if we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John.  It's been good talking with you, and I hope we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your final offer, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge. We gave a strong signal we were about to walk away, and she countered by splitting the difference *against* our favor. At this point, any further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
