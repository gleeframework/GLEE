"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you say $13,500 is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $13,000.  That's already a significant stretch for me. Can we make this work at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,200. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is really my limit. I can do $13,100, but if we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John.  It's been good talking with you, and I hope we can make this work.",13100.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13250.0,Alice,9,
