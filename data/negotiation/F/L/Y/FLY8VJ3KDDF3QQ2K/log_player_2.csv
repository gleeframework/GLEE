# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $100, which is still within my budget, and it's better than paying $90.
