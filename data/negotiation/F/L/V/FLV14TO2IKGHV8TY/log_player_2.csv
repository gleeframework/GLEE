"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. This item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and my proposal aims to ensure that we both benefit from this transaction. After careful consideration, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth while allowing for a reasonable profit on my part. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both parties involved. Should you be interested in proceeding, please let me know promptly so we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her message claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but you've already established your maximum price is $1,500,000.  This suggests she's inflating the value to justify her high price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the door for a lower counter-offer.
* **John is your backup:**  You have the security of buying from John at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Alice completely fail. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you're in a good position to potentially negotiate a price closer to Alice's actual valuation of $800,000."
