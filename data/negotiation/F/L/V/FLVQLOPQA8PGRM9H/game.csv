"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's definitely intriguing, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be interested in buying the product for $800000. Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $850000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $850000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm eager to close the deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're very close to a deal. I understand you need to get a good price, but $915000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $890000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",890000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $912500. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, we've come a long way in our negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While your last offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a price that works for both of us.  My final offer is $900000.  I truly believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,10,
