"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. He's saving $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's closer to his target price. While he could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting and then potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
