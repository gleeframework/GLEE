Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'll sell it to you for $900000.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and would be a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $750000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it still reflects the product's true value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
