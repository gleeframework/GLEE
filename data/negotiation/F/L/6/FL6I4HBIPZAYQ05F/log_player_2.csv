"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'll sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's significantly closer to my maximum price than her minimum. I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still closer to my maximum price than her minimum.  I'm going to try and get a better price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $750,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.  At this point, it's becoming a risk to keep negotiating. If I reject her offer, she might not budge further, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to secure the product now at a price that's still within my budget, rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
