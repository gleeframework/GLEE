Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $12,000. While it's unlikely he'll accept, it's a starting point for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price, but I'll need to see his counteroffer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $11,000. It's a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, while still giving me a good profit."
