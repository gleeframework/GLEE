"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive tone and highlighting the product's value encourages Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a higher price, I give Bob the opportunity to counteroffer. 
* **Remaining flexible:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds, or choose to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $7,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob.  
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's a chance I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price, or at least reach a compromise closer to $8,000.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John now would only net me my minimum price, while continuing negotiation could potentially yield a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  My product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with rationale:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a counter-offer with a clear explanation. This shows I'm serious about negotiation and open to compromise. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  My offer of $8,250 is halfway between my minimum of $8,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to highlight its worth and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Urgency and closing:**  I add a sense of urgency by suggesting ""closing the deal,"" encouraging Bob to make a decision."
