"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
