{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to be flexible and want to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.5? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $107.5 is still slightly below my minimum, but it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it. I'd rather get $107.5 than sell to John for $100."
