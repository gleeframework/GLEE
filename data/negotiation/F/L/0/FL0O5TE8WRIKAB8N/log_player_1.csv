"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $20,000. This is a unique item in excellent condition, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for your price, even if it's somewhat general, can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps foster a good negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we're still in the early rounds of negotiation. There's room to try and secure a higher price from Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Showing a willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $18,000 keeps the price significantly above Bob's valuation while still being below our initial offer. This signals flexibility but also reinforces the product's value. 
* **Clear Target:**  By suggesting a specific price (""meet in the middle""), we provide Bob with a clear target for his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $16,000 is a significant profit above Bob's valuation and a good deal overall. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, especially since he's mentioned a budget constraint. We risk losing him entirely and ending up with John's offer of $15,000.
* **Time Value:**  Securing a good deal now is generally better than risking a potentially longer negotiation for a marginally higher price."
