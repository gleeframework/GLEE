Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product. 
* **It's close to the middle ground:** This makes the offer seem reasonable and increases the likelihood of a quick deal. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a price closer to my minimum ($12,000).  I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob stall."
