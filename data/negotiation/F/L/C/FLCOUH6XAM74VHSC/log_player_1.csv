Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this product is valuable enough to warrant a price above $2 million, and Bob might be willing to pay it.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary, as I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop in price. I'll counter with a higher price, still aiming for a good profit while being prepared to possibly sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, a more appealing price for Bob.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale to John at the same price.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
