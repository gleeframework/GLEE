"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we're offering it to you for $9500. We understand its worth to you is $8000, but we hope this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's trying to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still too high. He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding my budget.  While $9,500 is a good starting point, I'm really hoping to stay closer to my target of $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to you. I'm glad to meet you halfway. In light of your offer, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $8750. I hope this price aligns better with your budget while still ensuring a reasonable return for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to push for a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get to $8,250. That would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge that small gap."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to consider a lower price. In light of your latest offer, I propose to sell the product to you for $8500. This price reflects a fair compromise between our interests and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's now only $500 above his target price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get much lower.  The risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John for $8,000 outweighs the potential benefit of trying to squeeze out another $250 or $500."
