"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
