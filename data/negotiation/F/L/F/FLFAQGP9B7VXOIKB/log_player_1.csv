Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below that will be instantly accepted. Alice needs to aim higher.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, giving her a strong bargaining position. 
* **Strategic Offer:**  Offering at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him.
    * Alice makes $150,000 more than Bob's initial valuation and avoids going to John.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, there would likely be counter-offers and further discussion."
