``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer."

Bob is not budging on his offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to accept his offer of $85 than sell to John for $80."
