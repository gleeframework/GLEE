"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  My product is worth more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow me to purchase today.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, though.  How about $8,000?  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
