"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the market value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000.  However, I value your professionalism and the product you're offering, so I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
