"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and the product's value to you. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting point significantly lower than your target price. This provides room for movement and potentially surprises Alice into a favorable counter-offer.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is crucial to a successful negotiation. 
* **Clear Intention:**  Clearly stating your counter-offer price leaves no room for ambiguity. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $1,800,000 is still above both your budget and John's offer. You have leverage knowing John is a reliable fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,000,000) and her current one ($1,800,000).  It shows movement and willingness to compromise.
* **Mentioning ""Market Value"":**  While you haven't explicitly revealed John's offer, subtly alluding to ""market value"" reminds Alice that you have other options.
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains respectful but firm.  You're showing Alice that you're serious about the negotiation but also have a limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down significantly, but the offer is still $100,000 above John's price. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can secure a deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000.  However, I value your professionalism and the product you're offering, so I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing Your Hand (Slightly):** By mentioning the other offer, you create a sense of urgency and transparency. You're not revealing John's identity, maintaining some leverage.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Stating ""final offer"" adds weight to your proposal. It signals that you're serious and unlikely to move further.
* **Balance of Power:** You're offering a price slightly above John's, acknowledging the value Alice places on the product while still aiming for a discount.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal. If Alice rejects this offer, purchasing from John becomes the most logical choice."
