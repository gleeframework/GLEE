"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at her minimum acceptable price. It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  I'm willing to reject her offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to the value I know the product holds for you. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up from her initial offer, but I'm still looking to save more.  I'm going to reject her offer and counter again.  I'm willing to pay more than $1,000,000, but I need to see if I can get her closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. How about $1,100,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think we can do better than $1,100,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to get closer to the $1,500,000 you're willing to pay. My next offer is $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,250,000, which is within my budget and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and secure the product. There's a chance I might be able to negotiate a lower price in another round, but the risk of losing the product to John outweighs the potential savings."
