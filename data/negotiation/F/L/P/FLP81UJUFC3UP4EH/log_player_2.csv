"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John is the most financially beneficial choice."
