"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $9,500 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
