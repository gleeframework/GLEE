"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
