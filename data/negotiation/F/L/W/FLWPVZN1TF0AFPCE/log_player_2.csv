# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down further, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

We're still making progress in the negotiation. Alice is consistently coming down, and we have time to push for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is consistently lowering her price, but the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll drop significantly below $815,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We only have a few rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price and risks pushing Alice away entirely. 
* **Good Deal:**  $815,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.

While we could try to negotiate further, accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
