"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down further, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $780,000? That reflects a significant movement on my part while acknowledging the value of the product you're offering.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",815000.0,Alice,7,
