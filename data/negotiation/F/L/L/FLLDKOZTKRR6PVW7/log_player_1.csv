I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial asking price. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept while still getting a decent price for the product."
