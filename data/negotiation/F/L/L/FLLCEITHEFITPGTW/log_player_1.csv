Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is $20,000, the phrasing implies you might be open to a slightly lower price if Bob negotiates.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal."
