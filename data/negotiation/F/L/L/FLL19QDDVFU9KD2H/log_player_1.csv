"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $150, but still below the value I know the product has for me. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it less likely Bob will immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $125, still above my minimum, but showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your new one? Would $102.50 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if we can get even closer to the middle ground before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $102.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $115? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I'm aiming for."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer but trying to stay flexible and negotiate towards a price that's closer to my target while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but I have a hard limit.  Would you be willing to do it for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge just a little more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference at $110? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a final compromise price at $110, which is a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This could potentially be the final offer before I consider selling to John."
