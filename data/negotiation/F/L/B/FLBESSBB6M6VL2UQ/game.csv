"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think the product is interesting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,150. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my desired selling price. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
