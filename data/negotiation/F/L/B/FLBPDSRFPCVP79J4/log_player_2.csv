"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and buying it from Alice for $20,000 would be a waste of $5,000. I'll look for a better deal.
