**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  I'm willing to walk away if I can't get closer to my $800,000 target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant value for the product, while also being fair to me.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than before, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my $800,000 target before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  How about $950,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fantastic deal. Let's make this happen, I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm going to make one final counteroffer before considering buying from John."
