The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is a terrible deal for me.  I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm willing to pay the maximum I'm comfortable with, $120.  This is fair, considering the product is worth $150 to Alice.  Let's see if she's willing to compromise."

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my maximum value. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'll offer Alice $130.  This is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her last offer and my maximum price. Hopefully, she'll accept."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems she's not willing to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $120."
