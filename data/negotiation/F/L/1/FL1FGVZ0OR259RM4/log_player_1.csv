Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's wise to start with a price higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if he finds the offer compelling.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** $125 is strategically placed above Bob's $100 valuation but still significantly below John's guaranteed $150 offer. This creates a sense of value for Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""special price,"" ""great deal"") to make the offer more appealing. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject $125. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $150, there's little risk in aiming slightly higher initially."
