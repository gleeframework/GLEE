Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a significant risk he won't go above $1,000,000.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
