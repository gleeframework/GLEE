{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have more leverage by making a counteroffer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, aiming to get the product at my desired price point. If Alice rejects this, we can continue to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her price is now within my budget. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It's also a better deal than buying from John, as I can save $400,000."
