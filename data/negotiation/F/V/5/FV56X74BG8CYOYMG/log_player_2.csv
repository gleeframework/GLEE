"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get an incredible deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is still a great deal, and I believe the product's value is worth every penny.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has now offered $725,000 twice and seems fixated on this price. She explicitly stated it's her ""best offer.""  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Since John offers the product for $800,000, and we are trying to save as much as possible, it's no longer worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice."
