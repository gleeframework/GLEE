"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is still a great deal, and I believe the product's value is worth every penny.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $675,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $675,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $700,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $700,000 is a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,7,
