Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $10,250? That's closer to your offer, but still allows me to reach my minimum. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, it's more strategic to buy from John now."
