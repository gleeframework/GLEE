"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even though he's trying to meet me in the middle.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $10,250? That's closer to your offer, but still allows me to reach my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm  offering a price slightly closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This is a compromise that hopefully leads to a deal."
