"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way above that. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further or buy from John to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $1,200,000 shows he's willing to negotiate but still wants a price closer to his value. This keeps the possibility of a deal with Alice while not jeopardizing his own budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000. However, it's getting closer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, it's strategically better for Bob to accept the offer and avoid further haggling.  This secures the product while still saving some money compared to Alice's initial asking price."
