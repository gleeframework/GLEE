"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer or can buy it from John for $10 less."
