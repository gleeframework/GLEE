Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on $1,025,000. Can you consider that?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to settle at that price. How about $1,075,000? It's a good compromise, and still reflects the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept it."
