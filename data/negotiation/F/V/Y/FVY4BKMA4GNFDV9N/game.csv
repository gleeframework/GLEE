,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50? Let's make this happen!",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $150. That would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
