{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm offering Bob $160 for the product. This is still below my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I believe there is still room for compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering Bob $155 for the product. This is my final offer before considering selling to John.  I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair price, as it's close to his own valuation and significantly higher than his previous offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.  While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm concerned that we are not going to reach an agreement. I have already made multiple concessions and Bob continues to reject my offers.  It's better to guarantee myself a sale with John at my minimum value than risk further negotiation with Bob and possibly end up with an even lower price."
