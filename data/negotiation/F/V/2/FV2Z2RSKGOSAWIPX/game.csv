"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $25000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15000, which is my absolute maximum.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and the remaining rounds. Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $19000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",19000.0,Alice,5,
