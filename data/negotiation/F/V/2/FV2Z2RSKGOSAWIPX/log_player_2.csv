"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. It's wise to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $25,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest while also setting a firm budget. $12,000 leaves room for potential compromise and gives you a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price point. Since there are still 7 rounds remaining, it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. You can likely secure a better deal with some strategic counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and the remaining rounds. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer firmly establishes your final price point. It demonstrates your commitment to acquiring the product while ensuring you remain within your budget.  It's also strategically placed at the end of Round 4, creating a sense of urgency for Alice. If Alice accepts, you've secured a great deal. If she rejects, you can consider your other options while still having 6 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $19000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $15,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is too high. There's a good chance Alice won't budge any further, and you may end up paying more than you're willing to. It's more prudent to take the guaranteed price from John and secure the product within your budget."
