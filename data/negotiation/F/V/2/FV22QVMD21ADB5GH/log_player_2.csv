"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer than our true maximum ($100) to give us room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Alice Room:** While low, $80 is still a decent profit for Alice (considering it's worth $120 to her). This makes it more likely she'll counter-offer rather than walk away. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to go to John and buy for $100 if Alice's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We are moving closer to our maximum price but in smaller increments to signal our interest while still trying to save money.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" aims to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Alice to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** We still have the option to buy from John for $100, which gives us bargaining power and prevents us from overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95.  Would you be willing to do $105 as our final price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice's latest offer of $105 is above our maximum budget of $100.
* **John's Price is Better:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer.
* **No Guarantee of Further Negotiation:**  Alice has framed her last offer as ""final,"" making it unlikely she'll go any lower.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John at this point."
