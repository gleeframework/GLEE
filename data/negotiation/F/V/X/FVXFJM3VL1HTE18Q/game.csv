"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think $9,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11000.0,Alice,5,
