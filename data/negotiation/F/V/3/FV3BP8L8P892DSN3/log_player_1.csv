Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that Bob is immediately likely to reject it. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a satisfactory price.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,000,000, which is a much better outcome."
