"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to start high, knowing that I can potentially lower the price in future rounds if necessary.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that Bob values the product enough that he'll be willing to negotiate further.  However, I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open in case the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the price reduction, but I still think we can do better. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe that we can still bridge the gap, and I'm confident that Bob will come up to a price closer to $1,000,000. I have a few more rounds to work with before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference - $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm ready to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target price, but I still need to save a bit. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm only $25,000 away from my desired price with Bob, the negotiation seems to be stalling. I've already made significant concessions, and Bob's counteroffers are not moving significantly towards my desired price.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.  John is offering my desired price, and it's better to secure the deal with him than risk losing out on a higher price."
