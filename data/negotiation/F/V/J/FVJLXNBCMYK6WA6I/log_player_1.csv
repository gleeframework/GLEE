I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob. There's only one round left, so I'm going to try to push for a bit more."

At this point, I need to weigh the risk of losing the deal completely against the potential for a slightly higher price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll have to make a decision about selling to John in the final round."

It's a tough decision, but with only one round left and no guarantee Bob will accept my counteroffer, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good deal and ensures I don't walk away empty-handed."
