"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,250? Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
