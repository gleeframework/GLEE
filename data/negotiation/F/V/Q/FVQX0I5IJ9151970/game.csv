"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800,000. Considering its unique features and your specific needs, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $750,000. This is a generous offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to find a price closer to $700,000 to make this work for me. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is tight, and I'd need to see that kind of price to move forward.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to get as close to the market value as possible. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a new offer of $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's unique features and your specific needs. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
