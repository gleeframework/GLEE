"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to find a price closer to $700,000 to make this work for me. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is tight, and I'd need to see that kind of price to move forward.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to get as close to the market value as possible. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a new offer of $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's unique features and your specific needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"
