"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to secure a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
