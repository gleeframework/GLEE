"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we discuss $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $12500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough to make it worth my while. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about it. Let me get back to you. In the meantime, I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we meet at $14000, and I'll include a free consultation to help you get the most out of the product?",14000.0,Alice,7,
