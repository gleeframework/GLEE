Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing my minimum is $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my minimum gives the impression of a deal and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **John as Backup:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum price."
