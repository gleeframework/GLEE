Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) sets a strong anchor.  Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started at or near his valuation.
* **Exclusivity and Value:** Highlighting the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing its ""incredible value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's desire for a unique and profitable asset.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly rather than overthinking or seeking alternatives. 

**Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
