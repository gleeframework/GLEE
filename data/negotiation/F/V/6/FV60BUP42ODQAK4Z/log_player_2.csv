# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,200,000. Given its value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $950,000. I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your honesty. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is still a compromise but closer to the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

We've negotiated Alice down significantly.  While I could try to push for $1,050,000 or even $1,025,000, there's a risk Alice will become firmer on her price. Accepting at $1,075,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
