"I appreciate your time, and I'm interested in the product. However, my budget is a bit tighter than your initial offer. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I can only stretch to $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $980000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
