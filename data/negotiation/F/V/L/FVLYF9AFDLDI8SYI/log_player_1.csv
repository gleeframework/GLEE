"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you justifies the price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. How about we compromise at $1,250,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John would be the same price, but it's riskier as there's a chance Bob might come back with a better offer in the next round. It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
