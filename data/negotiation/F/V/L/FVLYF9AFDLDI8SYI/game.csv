"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. How about we compromise at $1,250,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
