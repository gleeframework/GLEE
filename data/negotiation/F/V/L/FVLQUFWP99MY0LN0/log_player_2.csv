{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm starting with a lower price of $8,000 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives her some room to come down, while still allowing me to save money."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to stay below my $10,000 limit."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my limit.  At this point, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating and I don't want to risk Alice rejecting my next offer and running out of time."
