Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price below what it's worth.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $8,000.  
* **Value to Alice:**  Alice values the product at $12,000.
* **John's offer:** Alice has a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $10,000, Alice is still making a profit ($10,000 - $8,000 = $2,000) and leaving some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Potential Outcome:** If Bob accepts, Alice gets a good deal. If Bob rejects, she still gets her minimum value from John."
