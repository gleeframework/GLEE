"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we try $9300? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product.",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9300 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and agree on $9150? This would be a good deal for both of us.",9150.0,Bob,6,
