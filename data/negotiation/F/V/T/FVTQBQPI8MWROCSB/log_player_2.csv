"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $120, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's Offer:** $120, the same price as Alice. 

Since Bob can get the product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change his final cost. However, rejecting the offer keeps the option open for potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice in the future."
