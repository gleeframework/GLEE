{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $100 but below your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum price, and you don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price."
