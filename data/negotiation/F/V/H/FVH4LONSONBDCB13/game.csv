"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to be careful with my finances. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be fair to myself. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be careful with my finances. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $980000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1050000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
