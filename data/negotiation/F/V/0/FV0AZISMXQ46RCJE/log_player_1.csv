Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and the potential it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable by comparison. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""incredible value"" and ""potential,"" I aim to shift Bob's focus towards the product's benefits and away from the high initial price.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer is a starting point. Bob is likely to negotiate, and I'll need to be prepared to lower the price. However, having John as a guaranteed backup buyer gives me significant leverage in the negotiation.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a chance Bob could outright reject this high offer.  However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
