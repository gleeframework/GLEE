"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the unique features it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you. While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price in a counter-offer.  Even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John for $15,000."
