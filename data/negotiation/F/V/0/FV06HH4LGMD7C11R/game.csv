"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,500,000 to me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,875,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
