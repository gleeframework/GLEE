"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I can offer it at $950,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but that price is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, and while I'm still open to negotiation, I need you to understand that this product is in high demand. My absolute bottom line is $875,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're getting close!  I can see you're serious about this purchase.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, let's make it $850,000 and call it a day.  This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,7,
