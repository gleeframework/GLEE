"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20,000. It's a great deal considering its potential worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the ""unique"" and ""potential worth"" of the product to pique Bob's interest and emphasize the potential value to him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, and I want to explore that possibility before settling for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is unfortunately too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price from $20,000 to $17,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlight Value and Deal:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that the $17,000 price is still a good deal for him.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate further but establishes a firm, yet reasonable, price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to make a decision based on your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While Bob has stated this is his final offer, there's a chance he might be willing to budge a bit more. However, I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guarantee a Profit:**  Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations that might result in a lower price or a failed deal.
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to make a decision that ensures a profitable outcome quickly."
