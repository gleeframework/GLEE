"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and inviting Bob to consider it. This can encourage him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. I'm willing to negotiate down, but I'm not going to accept a price below my minimum.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my target price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise.  However, I'm keeping the option of selling to John in mind as a backup plan if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a counter-price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately.
* **Positive framing:** I'm again framing the offer as fair and beneficial to both parties. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a midpoint, I'm trying to find common ground with Bob and incentivize him to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.  I'm still considering the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't progress as expected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. Can you consider my offer again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his $13,000 offer, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm getting closer to my goal, I don't want to settle for a price that's too low. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore those possibilities further. 

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm aware of the risk that he may become less willing to compromise as the rounds progress. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind, as this deal would guarantee my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  Would you consider $13,250?  It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would help me feel confident that we've reached a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $13,000 to $13,250. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to make a final push toward a price that's both acceptable to me and potentially enticing enough for Bob. I'm still considering selling to John if the negotiations don't progress further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $13,125. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,125 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to explore if there's any further room for negotiation before I resort to selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

I have four rounds remaining, and I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll make another counter-offer, but I'll also start considering selling to John if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory point. I don't want to risk losing out on the potential for a higher price if there's still a chance to improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's try to bridge the gap just a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,187.50.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's still closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13187.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:** I'm offering a slight concession, increasing my offer from $13,125 to $13,187.50. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my desired price point. 
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the word ""compromise,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a deal.
* **Appeal to practicality:** I'm stating that this price is ""closer to what I need to make this deal work,"" subtly suggesting that I'm nearing the point of selling to John.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm making a final push for a better price. While still considering selling to John, I'm determined to see if there's any further room for negotiation with Bob. This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $13,150. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still significantly lower than my desired price, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John. I've made a decent effort to negotiate with Bob, but the gap between our desired prices is too significant to close in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the $15,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit, and while I might be able to squeeze a little more from Bob, the risk of a deal falling through outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
