Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $85, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $85. It's more beneficial to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
