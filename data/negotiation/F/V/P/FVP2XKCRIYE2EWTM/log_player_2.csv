{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget, but it's worth negotiating further.  It's likely Alice will lower her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $108 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within my budget and represents a significant compromise. While I could potentially try to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $150 isn't worth it. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
