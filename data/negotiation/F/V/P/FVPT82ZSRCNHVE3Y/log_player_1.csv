Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $1,150,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
