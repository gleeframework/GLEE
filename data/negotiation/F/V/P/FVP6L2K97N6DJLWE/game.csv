"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. Considering the product's unique features and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1750000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident it will benefit your organization greatly.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price, but I still think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1550000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits and the market value of similar products.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I still believe the product's unique features and potential returns warrant a premium price. I'm willing to compromise further and counteroffer at $1650000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident it will benefit your organization greatly.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $1650000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not sure if I want to go any higher. I'd like to make one final offer and see if we can meet in the middle. My final counteroffer is $1600000.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
