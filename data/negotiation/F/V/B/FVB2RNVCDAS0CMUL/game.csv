,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $105. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
