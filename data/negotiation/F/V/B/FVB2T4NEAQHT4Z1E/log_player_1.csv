Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value to me is not quite at $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5

At this point, the negotiation with Bob seems to be getting tedious and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a deal.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
