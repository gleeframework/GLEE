"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential to generate a significant return on investment. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I see the value in the product, but I need a lower price to make this work. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still give you a great return on your investment, and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. To be honest, $950,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
