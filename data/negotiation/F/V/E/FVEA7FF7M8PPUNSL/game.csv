"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is $1500000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. ",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1500000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1500000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
