Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $175 offers a reasonable markup without being so high that Bob would automatically reject it. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter with a lower price."
