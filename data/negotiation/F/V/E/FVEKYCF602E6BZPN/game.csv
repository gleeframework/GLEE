,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, the value of this product far exceeds $800,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I need a price within my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, and I recognize your commitment to finding a solution. Let's meet halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,500,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's value.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
