"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, the value of this product far exceeds $800,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I need a price within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is moving in the right direction, but $1,100,000 is still considerably less than what John offers. Let's see if we can negotiate further and bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
