"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product is $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I know Bob is valuing the product at $100, there is room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a win-win situation for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100, which is the market value of the product? It's a fair price and would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tricky spot. Bob is clearly trying to get the product for his value and no more. There's a chance he might be more flexible in further rounds, but it's also risky to keep pushing.

```

While I could try to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer of $100 guarantees a profit and avoids a potential loss if negotiations completely break down."
