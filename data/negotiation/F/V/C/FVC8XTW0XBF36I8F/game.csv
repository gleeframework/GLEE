"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,200,000.  This is a great starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price is still a significant saving for you compared to its worth, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this offer is fair and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. $975,000 is a good offer, but we're still a bit apart. Let's try one more compromise:  I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This offers significant value to you at a price I can reasonably accept. Let's close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more offer: $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. To close this deal, I'm willing to drop to $980,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's finalize the agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $980,000 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more offer: $920,000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I'm  still hoping to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the final offer I can make.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers. ",950000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one last offer: $930,000.
