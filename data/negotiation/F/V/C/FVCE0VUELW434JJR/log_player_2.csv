Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which would be $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice has met your ideal price. There's no benefit to going through another round of negotiation or buying from John."
