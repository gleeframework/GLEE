"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm aware that this is a high price, but I'm confident the product is worth it, and this gives me room to negotiate down. I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also prepared to go to John if I don't feel like we're making progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his first offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to counter with a lower price, but one that's still profitable for me, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for me. It's also a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary. I'm still not comfortable with the idea of selling to John at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm not willing to sell to John yet as I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs.  I'm determined to close this deal with Bob, as his value for the product is still higher than John's.  I'm hoping he sees the value of this offer and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. There are only a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob, but if the next few rounds don't result in a more profitable offer, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This is a very significant concession, almost reaching my minimum.  I'm making a final push to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  If this is rejected, I'm going to sell to John.  The risk of losing a large profit isn't worth the chance of getting a little more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've reached my limit for negotiation with Bob. We're very close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price.  John's offer guarantees me a comfortable profit, and I'm ready to move on."
