"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my own minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits for Bob, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Information Gathering:** This first offer is as much about gathering information about Bob's willingness to pay as it is about securing an immediate sale. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate your offer, but I am only able to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. We have plenty of room for negotiation and a good alternative with John. Rejecting this offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $2,000,000. I'm confident it will provide you with significant returns on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We lower our asking price by $300,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.  
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still substantially above both Bob's offer and our absolute minimum, preserving room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value to Bob, aiming to shift his focus from the price to the potential benefits. 

We need to incentivize Bob to counter with a more reasonable offer while avoiding the risk of him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still cannot exceed $800,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, indicating that he might be hesitant to move significantly from his valuation.  However, we still have several rounds of negotiation, and walking away with John's offer is always an option. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see some movement from your side to justify continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000, but that's my final offer for this round.  I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Stance:** We're sending a clear message that Bob needs to increase his offer.  Stating ""final offer for this round"" introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Significant Concession:**  Another $300,000 reduction shows flexibility but keeps the price well above Bob's current offer and our minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** We again highlight the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to consider more than just his initial budget.

This offer aims to:

* **Elicit a Counter:**  Encourage Bob to move away from his $800,000 and propose a counteroffer closer to our range.
* **Maintain Control:**  While showing willingness to negotiate, we remain firm on a price significantly above Bob's valuation.

The next round will be crucial in determining if a deal with Bob is possible or if selling to John is the more profitable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. While it's a reduction, I still cannot meet you at $1,700,000. I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $800,000. I hope we can reach a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not budged from his initial offer of $800,000 despite several rounds of negotiation and significant price reductions on our part. This strongly suggests he is unwilling or unable to meet us at a price that is acceptable. 

We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is almost double Bob's offer and meets our minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a significant risk of losing both offers and potentially settling for a less favorable deal in the future.

Therefore, it is in our best interest to **sell the product to John for $1,500,000**. This ensures a profitable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
