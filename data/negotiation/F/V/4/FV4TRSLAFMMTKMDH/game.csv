"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  My initial offer is $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.  My counteroffer is $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my counteroffer is $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $825,000 is still too low for me. Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my counteroffer is $812,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $812,500 is still far below my minimum price.  I've already lowered my offer significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  My final offer is $950,000.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,7,
