"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus, worth $250, to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get an even better value for your money. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
