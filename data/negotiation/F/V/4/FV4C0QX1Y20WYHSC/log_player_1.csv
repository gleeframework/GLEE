Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield more profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob:** Gets a $100,000 discount from the product's worth to him.
    * **Alice:** Earns $100,000 more than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a good deal."
