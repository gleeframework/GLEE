"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.  This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a great starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $850,000? This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
