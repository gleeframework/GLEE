"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to start high, at $95. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's also a price that I believe is still within his range of willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $85. This is still a good profit for me and is likely within Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price of $80. It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
