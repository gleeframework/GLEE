,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $100? Let's see if we can find some common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives us both a fair deal, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
