"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying at a higher price before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than his offer. I'm hoping this will push him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I still believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be more flexible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500.  This is a lower counteroffer than the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob and see if he's willing to meet me there.  I'm also aware of the time limit, so I need to be more flexible in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though time is running out, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I need to be strategic.  I need to make an offer that's appealing to Bob, but also gives me a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,800. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement. It also leaves room for a final counteroffer from Bob if he's still interested.  It's getting close to the end, so I need to be flexible, but still aim for the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $10,800 is better than selling to John for $10,000, and I don't have much leverage left to push for a higher price."
