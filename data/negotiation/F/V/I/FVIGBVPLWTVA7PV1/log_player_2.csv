"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9200 for the product. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer of $9,200 is closer to Bob's value of $8,000, there's still room for negotiation to get the price even lower. Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $9,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way back to $8750, but I can meet you halfway between $9200 and $8750. How about we meet at $9075? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,075. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,075
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's value:**  $8,000
* **Alice's offer:** $9,075
* **John's price:** $10,000

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's price.  It's also a reasonable compromise.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $925 compared to buying from John, which is a good outcome."
