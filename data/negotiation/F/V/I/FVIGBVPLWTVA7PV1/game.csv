"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $8500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9200 for the product. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $9200 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $8750. Would you be open to that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way back to $8750, but I can meet you halfway between $9200 and $8750. How about we meet at $9075?",9075.0,Alice,5,
