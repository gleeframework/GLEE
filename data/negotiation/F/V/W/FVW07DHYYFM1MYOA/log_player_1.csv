Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed $800,000 from John. Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, even though John's offer is a safety net.
* **Value framing:** Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential,"" justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  Alice doesn't know Bob well. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective. 
* **Relationship building:** While aiming for maximum profit is key, Alice might also consider the long-term benefits of a positive relationship with Bob, especially if he's a valuable contact in the future."
