"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
