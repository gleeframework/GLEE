{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value, which is $10,000. This is a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also aiming to get a better price than the initial offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my desired price point. I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair counteroffer, as it's closer to Alice's price, but still within my budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price that's very close to my ideal price point.  I've already rejected two offers, and continuing to negotiate might risk her getting frustrated and walking away.  Accepting this offer allows me to purchase the product for a good price within my budget."
