"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $800000 is certainly a starting point, the product's true value is significantly higher. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This reflects a substantial discount and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
