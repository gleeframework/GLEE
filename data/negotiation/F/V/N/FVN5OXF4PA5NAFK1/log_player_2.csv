"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Maximum Willingness to Pay:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the $12,000 price is a good deal given your budget constraints and the alternative."
