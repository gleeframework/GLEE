"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is too far below my value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and gives you a significant savings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
