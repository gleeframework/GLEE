"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While I'm open to working with you, $9,800 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  Let's aim for a compromise at $10,200. This would still be a very good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
