{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $75 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $70, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $75.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am trying to get a better deal.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $72 is still above my ideal price point.  I want to try and get closer to $70. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter again and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 71}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $71. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better deal. It's a small increment that might be enough to convince Alice to accept, especially since she's already lowered her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $72.5 is a good compromise. It's closer to my target price of $70 and only $2.50 more than my last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might save me another dollar or two, but it risks losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most sensible option, given my goal of acquiring the product while saving money."
