Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer to avoid settling for the lower price prematurely. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of closing a deal that's significantly more profitable than selling to John."
