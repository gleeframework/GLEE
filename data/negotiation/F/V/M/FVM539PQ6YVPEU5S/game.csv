,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid 8000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for 11000. This is a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise given my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for 9500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for 10800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. I'm still not able to go any higher than $9500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 9500 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for 10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
