Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's value leaves room for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  A price closer to the middle ground between your minimum and Bob's maximum makes the offer seem fairer and less likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, so you have leverage to aim higher with Bob."
