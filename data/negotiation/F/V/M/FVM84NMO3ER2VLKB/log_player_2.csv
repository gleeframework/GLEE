Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $13,000.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $13,250.  This gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
