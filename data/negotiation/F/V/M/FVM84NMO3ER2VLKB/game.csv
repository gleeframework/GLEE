"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $12,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer, and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $13,000.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $13,250.  This gives us both a fair deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
