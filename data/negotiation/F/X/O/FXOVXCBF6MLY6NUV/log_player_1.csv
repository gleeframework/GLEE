Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than the value of the product to me, it's still close enough that it's worth continuing negotiations. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to the value of the product to him and to my own floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $780,000 is close enough to the value of the product to me, and to the price that John is willing to pay, that I'll accept it. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
