,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see something closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm ready to meet you halfway, but I need to see $975,000 to move forward. This price acknowledges your needs and helps me achieve my goals. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $925,000.
