"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to me to make the offer seem more attractive and to potentially persuade Bob to pay more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm giving Bob a clear path to counter-offer, encouraging further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the possibility of a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more to me, implying a potential loss on my end if I sell at a much lower price.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  While I'm offering a compromise, the price remains above Bob's initial offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob to meet me halfway.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintaining Position:** While his offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum.
* **Strategic Advantage:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum, giving me leverage in this negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final compromise. If we can't agree on a price that works for both of us, I might need to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm still willing to make one more offer. I can do $10,800, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your urgency, but $10,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,200.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to walk away and explore other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Guaranteed Alternative:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum, guaranteeing a significantly higher price. 

Given the limited rounds remaining, the potential for further negotiation, and my guaranteed alternative with John, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This decision ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of a lower sale price with Bob."
