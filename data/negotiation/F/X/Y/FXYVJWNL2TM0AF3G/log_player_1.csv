"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,000 is still below my minimum threshold, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $13,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm firm on $13,500.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've been through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to come up much higher than $13,000.  That's still below my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with nothing.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
