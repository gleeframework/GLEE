I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $8,000, I'm hoping I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting too close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation resulting in a lower price. John's offer of $8,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum value."
