{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love.  I'm thinking $12,000 would be a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant profit for me and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to be flexible and see if I can close the deal quickly. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's too low, I'll counter back, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $8,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it holds for me, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $10,000 is still above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my desired profit.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Gaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and gives me leverage in the next round of negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still attractive to him but closer to my desired price. My goal is to bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is tempting, I'd need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not conceding too much, still holding out for a profit closer to my original target.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to further justify the price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John for $8,000 as a last resort. However, I'm confident that this counteroffer will be attractive enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value the product, but I still can't meet the price of $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Profit:** While $9,500 isn't my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable offer of $8,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a significant chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for $8,000.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a higher price.

**Strategy:**

It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. Given the closeness of the offer to my minimum, accepting seems like the most logical choice to secure a profit."
