,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a little outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise and get us both closer to our goals.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,900. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your decision.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  Would you consider $10,800?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big impact for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
