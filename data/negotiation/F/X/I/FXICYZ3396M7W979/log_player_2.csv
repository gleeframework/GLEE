"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,000, and it's a reasonable price considering that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  Bob is trying to strike a balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,500. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer again, or that he might lose the opportunity to buy the product altogether.  It's more beneficial for Bob to accept the current offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
