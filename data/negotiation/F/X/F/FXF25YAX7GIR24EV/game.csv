"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $85, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I'm really interested,  $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $86?  I think that's a fair compromise, and would allow us to close the deal.",86.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $86. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $88.25. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",88.25,Alice,5,
