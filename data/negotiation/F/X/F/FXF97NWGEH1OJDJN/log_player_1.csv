Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also frames the offer as beneficial to Bob, highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. By rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer, I can explore the possibility of reaching a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $12,000 is a bit low for me considering the product's condition and value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my target price of $14,000. Accepting his offer will result in a good profit for me and avoid further negotiation. While I could try to get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely to John or Bob walking away entirely is too high.  $13,000 is a good deal and I'm happy to accept."
