"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  To start our negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to show you my good faith.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
