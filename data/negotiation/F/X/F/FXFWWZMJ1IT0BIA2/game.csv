"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,112,500?",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,087,500?",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't justify going below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm counting on you to meet me in the middle.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
