Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so he has incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher starting price might scare Bob off immediately.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. It's worth taking another round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, it's worth accepting Bob's offer for a slightly higher price.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob might walk away or I might lose out on a sale to John. This offer is a good compromise that ensures a decent profit."
