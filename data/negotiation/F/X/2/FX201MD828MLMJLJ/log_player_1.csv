{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but I'm open to a counteroffer from Bob. This approach allows for a potential win-win situation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a strong bargaining position. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob.
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's initial offer and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving from my initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's offer but significantly closer to his perceived value.  This creates an opportunity for a deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm compromising, I'm not giving up too much. The offer remains above my minimum acceptable price, and I still have the option to sell to John if negotiations break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's within a range I'm comfortable with.
* **Commitment from Bob:** Bob has expressed a strong commitment to buying the product at this price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue to negotiate and hope for a higher price, there's a risk that the negotiations will break down, and I might end up selling to John for $15,000. This offer is a good compromise that secures a sale."
