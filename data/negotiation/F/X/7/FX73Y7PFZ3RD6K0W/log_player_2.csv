"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a lower price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable deal for her, as it's higher than what she values the product at.  This is a good starting point for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to ensure I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still a bit too high for Bob's target price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to drop her price even further. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob can leverage the fact that he has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's value of the product ($10,000) while still remaining within his budget. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise, but he also wants to get a good deal. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
