"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
