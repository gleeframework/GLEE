"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my minimum of $10,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest in the product, $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250, which would be $9,125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,125 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within a few rounds of negotiation and I'm holding out for a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum of $10,000 with a bit more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I'm happy to work with you, $9,125 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,150, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,150 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, I still have a few rounds left and I'm hoping to get a better price. It's a risk, but I think I can still squeeze out a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about we meet at $9,175?  I know this isn't a huge jump, but it's a small compromise that could bring us to a deal quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,150 and $9,175, which would be $9,162.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and while $9,162.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still quite a bit less than what I'd like to get.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's the best I can do with the limited time and negotiation rounds."
