Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised offer bridges the gap while acknowledging the value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While I'm committed to reaching an agreement, $900,000 remains significantly below my bottom line.  I can go down to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
