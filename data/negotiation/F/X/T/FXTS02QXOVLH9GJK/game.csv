"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation, but $8,250 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625?  It's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away happy. ",8625.0,Alice,5,
