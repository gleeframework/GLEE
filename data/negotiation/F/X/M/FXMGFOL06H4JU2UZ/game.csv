"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
