Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80):** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price ($120):** This demonstrates you are open to negotiation and keeps the deal alive. 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, you can gauge his interest and see if he's willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  You can likely get a better price than $85."

Bob's offer:
