"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $105. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not ready to meet you at $115 yet. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $130 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
