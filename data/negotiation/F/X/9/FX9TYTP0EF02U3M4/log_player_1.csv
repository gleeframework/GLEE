Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially leading to a price higher than $100.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Starting too high might discourage Bob immediately. $140 presents a significant discount while still being profitable. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
