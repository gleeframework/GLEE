"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as long as it's truly in good condition.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $8,500 is a little lower than I'd like to go. How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
