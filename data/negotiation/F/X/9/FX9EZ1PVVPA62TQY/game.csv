"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly value your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a significant step towards meeting your needs while staying within my price range.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $920,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a significant commitment from my side, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. It's a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the transaction.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $890,000, which is $905,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.
