"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $875000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $20000. This will give you an even better return on your investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,,20000.0

"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added value of the service package.  It's a great deal, but $875000 is still a little high for me.
