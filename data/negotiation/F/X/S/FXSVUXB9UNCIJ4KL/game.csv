"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we aim for $11,000? I hope this proposal is within your considerations.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  $11,000 is a bit too far below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. Considering the value of the product and my budget, how about we aim for $11,200?",11200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $11,200 is still a bit below where I can comfortably sell.  I'm willing to go down to $11,300 as a final compromise.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",11300.0,Alice,5,
