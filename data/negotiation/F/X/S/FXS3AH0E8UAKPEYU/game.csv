"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for me. This product is not just an item; it represents a significant milestone in my journey. I am offering you the chance to own this piece at a special introductory price of $2000000. I believe its true worth far exceeds this figure, but I am eager to explore the possibility of a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your interests, and we can proceed to discuss further details.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your unique product, the price of $2000000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this offer reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, your offer of $1600000 is closer, but still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell it at a good price and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
