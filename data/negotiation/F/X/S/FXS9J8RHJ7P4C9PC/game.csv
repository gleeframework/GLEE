"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a great deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,175,000.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,112,500. This price would be a good deal for both of us and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.",1112500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,112,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product and is a good compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
