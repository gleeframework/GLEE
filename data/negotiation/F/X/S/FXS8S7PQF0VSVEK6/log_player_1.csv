"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value (""great deal considering its value"") helps emphasize the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is a great opportunity, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Holding out for more:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and show I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have the opportunity to explore if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:**  Again emphasizing the product's worth to keep the focus on a good deal for Bob.
* **Fairness:**  Framing $95 as a ""fair compromise"" makes it sound more palatable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $85 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm hoping to get closer to $90 in the next round.
* **Remaining rounds:** With 6 rounds left, I can afford to reject Bob's offer and see if he'll come up to a more acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $90. This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $90 is still a fair deal for him.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to make the offer sound appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price.  
* **Remaining rounds:**  I have 4 rounds left and the potential to get a slightly higher price if I push a bit more. 

I'm going to risk it and see if I can get closer to $90 in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I want to make this work. However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $88. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small step up:** I'm increasing my offer by just $1 to show flexibility, but not sacrificing too much.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $88 as a ""fair compromise"" and ""allows me to cover my costs"" to make it more appealing.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""make this work"" to show a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Last chance:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and not risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $84 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds left:**  With only two rounds remaining, the potential for a better deal with Bob is getting slim.
* **Below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $84 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $80 guarantees me a profit, and I won't have to risk losing the deal entirely. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and ending up with nothing outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
