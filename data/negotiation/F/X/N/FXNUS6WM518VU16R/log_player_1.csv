"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than what I consider the product to be worth.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $12,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum than his first offer, it's still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a bit more.  How about $13,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little too high for me. How about $13,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than his previous offer, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
