This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable cost compared to its market value of $150. I trust you'll find this offer appealing and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

While Alice's offer is below her stated market value, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($80).  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a better price with Alice or move on to John's offer."
