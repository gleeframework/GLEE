"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its value to me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $820,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $880,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a much better starting point for us to reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I believe we can still find a middle ground. I would like to counter with a proposal of $860,000. This allows for a fair profit for you while staying within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still committed to reaching a deal with you, but $860,000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $870,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",870000.0,Alice,5,
