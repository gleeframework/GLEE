"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a great price considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $11,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my target. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,500? It's closer to my budget and closer to your target price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $11,500 is getting closer, but I need to be at least at $12,000 to make this work.  Would you be willing to go to $11,800?  That's a small increase for you, but it helps me get closer to my target price.",11800.0,Alice,5,
