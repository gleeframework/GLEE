"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000? That's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it would make this deal more attractive to me.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go down to $13,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $13,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13800.0,Alice,3,
