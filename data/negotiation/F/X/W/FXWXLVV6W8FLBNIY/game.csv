"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your expertise.

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, the price point is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to be fair to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000, which I believe is still a very reasonable price considering its potential to benefit your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. To meet somewhere in the middle, I could go up to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects the serious interest I have in acquiring the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value the potential synergy our partnership could bring. To close the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, and I understand your position with other potential buyers. To be completely upfront, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can justify for this acquisition. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
