"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm initially offering it to you for $1,300,000.  I'm confident that at this price, you'll see remarkable returns.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  Let's start with a more realistic number. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm eager to make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my limit.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. I hope we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding common ground.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the very lowest price I can justify.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my financial reach.  I'm truly interested in acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my strict budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere commitment. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
