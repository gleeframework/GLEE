"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you get a great deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still fitting within a range you're comfortable with.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. How about we split the difference and I pay you $11,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
