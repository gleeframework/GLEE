Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. How about we split the difference and I pay you $11,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.
