Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), aiming slightly lower increases the chance of Bob accepting and still secures a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob immediately avoids potential delays associated with John's purchase.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  The message implies scarcity and value, encouraging Bob to act quickly.  
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale to Bob."
