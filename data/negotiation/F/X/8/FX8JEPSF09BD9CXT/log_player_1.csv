"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, and the message is friendly and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price. I'll reject the offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $115 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to sell to John for $120 rather than risk getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
