"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
