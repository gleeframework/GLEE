"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that reflects your target price range. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating your position and desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $18,000 is my ideal price point, I understand we may need to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down significantly, but $14,000 is still considerably more than your $8,000 maximum and her own $12,000 valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to lower the price suggests there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we both might agree on. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** The message acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while firmly stating your budget limit.
* **Fair Offer:**  Offering $8,000 presents your maximum price.  It allows Alice to understand your constraints while still leaving some room for her to potentially counter if she's truly motivated to sell. 
* **Time Constraint:** As the rounds progress, it becomes more important to signal your ideal price point clearly, especially if you're considering John's offer as a backup."
