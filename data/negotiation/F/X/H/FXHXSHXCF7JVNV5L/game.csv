"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $12000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $9500.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate you coming down in price, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but $10000 is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer for this round.",11000.0,Alice,7,
