Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for potential negotiation and finding a price point that's mutually agreeable (but still above your minimum)."
