"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I'm offering this product to you for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $17,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $16,000?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. He's still willing to pay less than $15,000, and there's still some room for negotiation. Buying from John would be a better deal at this point, but it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $15,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 15500}
