Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a good price considering John is selling for $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and saving $150,000."
