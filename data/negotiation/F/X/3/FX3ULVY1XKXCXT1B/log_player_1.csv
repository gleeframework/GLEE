Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity for someone like you with your expertise. I'm confident this product will be worth significantly more to you than the asking price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a high price initially sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting Bob's expertise suggests the product's value could be higher for him, making the price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,500,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, allowing for potential concessions without sacrificing too much.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or cutting my losses and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** I need to make at least $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:** Selling to John guarantees I'll get my minimum. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it does show interest. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and try to secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work.  This product has a lot of potential, and I believe it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer but remains above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Long-Term Value:** I emphasize the product's future potential to persuade Bob that this price is justified.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""Let's find a middle ground"" keeps the door open for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm also willing to accept John's offer if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds my minimum price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Guarantee of Better:** While I could counteroffer and try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. He might walk away, leaving me with John's offer.
* **Time is Money:** Prolonging the negotiation risks losing time and potentially missing other opportunities. Accepting Bob's offer is a secure way to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll move forward with the sale to Bob, ensuring a smooth transaction and clear communication to avoid any potential complications."
