I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000, which is still below my maximum budget but significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also looking for a fair price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. However, it's closer to my ideal price than her previous offer. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}

I'm increasing my offer to $880,000. This is a compromise that shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. This also keeps me under my budget while pushing for a more favorable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's closer to my ideal price, the negotiations seem to be going in circles. At this point, it's more financially beneficial to buy from John and secure the product at a guaranteed price within my budget."
