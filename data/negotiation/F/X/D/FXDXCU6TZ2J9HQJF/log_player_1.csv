{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is higher than the $80 Bob values the product at, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $120 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth exchange. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $100. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to make a worthwhile profit. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still giving you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $102. This price is closer to my budget while still allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $102 is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. It's not ideal, but it guarantees I make a profit."
