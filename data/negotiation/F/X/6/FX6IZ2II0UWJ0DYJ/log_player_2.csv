"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $875,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price considering my goal is to save as much money as possible.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further or that I'll run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a good price and don't risk losing out on the opportunity altogether."
