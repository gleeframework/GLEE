Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down later.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup. If he counters, it opens the door for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product helps justify the high asking price, even if you don't go into specifics.

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, remember that getting the best possible price from Bob is ideal. Don't be afraid to negotiate, but be prepared to walk away if necessary knowing you have a backup option."
