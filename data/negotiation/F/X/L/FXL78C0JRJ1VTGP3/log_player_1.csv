Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer without excessive negotiation.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will sell to John for $800,000. There's no opportunity to counter-offer in this scenario."
