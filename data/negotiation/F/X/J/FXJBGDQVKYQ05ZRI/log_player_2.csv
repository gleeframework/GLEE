Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would still prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target and is a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Alice is also willing to compromise. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product without further negotiation and avoid potentially wasting more time."
