"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards my position, Alice.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
