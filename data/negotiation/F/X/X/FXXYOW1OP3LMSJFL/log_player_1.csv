"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, but still below its value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and also shows that I'm open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $750,000 yet.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering. I still have 9 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $800,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
