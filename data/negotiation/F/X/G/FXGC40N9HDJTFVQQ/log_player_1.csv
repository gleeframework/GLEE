Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
