{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000. I know it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident he'll find the product valuable at this price, and I'm open to discussing a potential compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and would still allow you to profit from it. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal considering the value of the product for both of us. Accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiations and secure a reasonable price."
