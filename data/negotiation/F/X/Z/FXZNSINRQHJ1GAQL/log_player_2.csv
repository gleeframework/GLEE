"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice is offering the product at your maximum price.  While accepting her offer would get you the product, it doesn't offer any savings.  Rejecting the offer allows you to consider other options, and since John is also offering the product for the same price, you are not losing out on the product."
