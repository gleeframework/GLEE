"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is quite low for this product. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we possibly settle on $70? That feels like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $70 is still a significant drop for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $90? That's my final offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
