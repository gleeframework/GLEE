Alice's offer is still too high.  Even though she lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can get closer."

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my budget. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower offer one more time before considering John's offer."
