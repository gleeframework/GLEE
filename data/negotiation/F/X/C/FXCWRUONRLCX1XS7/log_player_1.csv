Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and hopefully still leaves me with a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000. 

I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it could be worth more to Bob, but I'm also aware of the possibility of him walking away.  I'll be ready to counter his offer or accept his counteroffer if it's reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  

I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $1,000,000, to show I'm open to negotiation, but still want a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a comfortable margin above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of my willingness to negotiate, but also recognize the inherent value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell my product for significantly less than my minimum.

I will counter with a higher price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  If he rejects my counteroffer again, I will finally sell to John, as $800,000 is still a good profit for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm offering $750,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of my product while also showing flexibility in my negotiations. 

If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to sell to John. But I'm hopeful that this offer will finally be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is still too low. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a better option than accepting such a low price."
