"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring options before committing. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm keeping the offer significantly lower than her initial price, but still within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. It's a small step towards meeting Alice's offer, but I'm still trying to save money. I believe we can reach a deal within this range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,180,000, which is a decent price, and we're only 5 rounds in. Accepting the offer is a good compromise, saving me $320,000 compared to buying from John. There's always a risk that I could get a lower price if I keep negotiating, but the chance of reaching a significantly lower price is decreasing with each round. It's better to secure a good deal now."
