"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $7,500.  However, I'm really looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to go that low?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to be honest, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,250 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $7,100?  This would give us both a good deal.",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,100. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we try $7,150? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7150.0,Alice,5,
