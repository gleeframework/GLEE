"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I'm confident this revised price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
