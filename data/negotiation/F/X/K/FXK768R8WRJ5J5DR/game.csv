"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling the product for $12000.  This price still gives you a great deal considering its value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm sure it's a good deal for you as well. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Bob,4,
