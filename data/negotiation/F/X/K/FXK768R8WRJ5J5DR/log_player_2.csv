# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's too early to accept, and I have 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling the product for $12000.  This price still gives you a great deal considering its value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I have 7 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm sure it's a good deal for you as well. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
