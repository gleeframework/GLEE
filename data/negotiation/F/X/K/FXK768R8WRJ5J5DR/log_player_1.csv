"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling the product for $12,000.  This price still gives you a great deal considering its value, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm sure it's a good deal for you as well. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum value of $10,000 and is a good deal considering the potential of further negotiation. I'm going to accept it."
