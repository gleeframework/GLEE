{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, allowing Bob to respond with either a counteroffer or a question about the product.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000. However, starting too high might scare Bob off. 
* This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to compromise. 
* I'll also factor in the ""John"" option â€“ if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a great product, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's better than his initial value of $8,000, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and try to get a better price.** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first.**

**Next steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. 
* I'll need to be careful not to push Bob too hard, as he might walk away entirely."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to continue working with you on this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""fair"" deal for both parties. It avoids being aggressive or confrontational.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while testing Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll have to reassess my options, considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still a bit hesitant about $10500. How about we settle on $9500?  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to make me comfortable selling. 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and try to get a better price.** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first.** 

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, but I'll need to be careful.  Since he's already rejected two offers, my counteroffer needs to be strategic. It needs to be close enough to his offer that he doesn't get frustrated, but high enough that I'm not selling too low."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $9,500 is getting closer.  However, I'm still at a point where I need to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're truly serious about this, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer of $10,500 but still above Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Message:** The message is firm but not aggressive. It emphasizes my willingness to compromise while also stating that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take the deal.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a significant compromise from my desired price but still above Bob's offer. It aims to bridge the gap and incentivize Bob to accept while maintaining a sense of leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, I'm ready to walk away and avoid selling at a loss."
