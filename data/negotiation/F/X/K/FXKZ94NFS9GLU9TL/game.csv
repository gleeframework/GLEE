"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I would like to suggest a price of $9,500 for the product.
