"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000 for the product.
