"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is tempting but still leaves significant room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my offer and I might end up paying more. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a favorable price."
