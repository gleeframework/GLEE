Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $120 (its value to you), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting you more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially landing on a price higher than $80 but lower than $110.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob now is preferable to waiting for John, even if the price difference is small. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
