Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value I place on this product is considerably higher than what you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still getting closer to Bob's maximum perceived value, but we're not there yet.  It makes sense to push a bit further to see if we can secure a higher price before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to propose an offer of $1,085,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob is clearly edging closer to his likely maximum price, and continuing to push aggressively might make him walk away. Accepting his offer of $1,085,000 ensures a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000 value minus $1,085,000 offer = $115,000 profit) and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
