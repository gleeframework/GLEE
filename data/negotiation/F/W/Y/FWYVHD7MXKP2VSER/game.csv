"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $9000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still covering my costs.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9000 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about $8750? This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9200. This is the minimum price I need to make it worth my while to sell the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price.",9200.0,Alice,5,
