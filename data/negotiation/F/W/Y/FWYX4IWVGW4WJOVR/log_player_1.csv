Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Alice values the product at $150, meaning she won't sell for less. However, she has a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob only values the product at $80.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering a price of $125 creates a potential win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $45 less than his perceived value, and Alice makes a $25 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Higher Starting Point:** Starting higher allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

While this offer might seem high, it's a strategic starting point for Alice to maximize her profit."
