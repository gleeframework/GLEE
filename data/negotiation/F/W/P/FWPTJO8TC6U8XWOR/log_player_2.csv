"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John, so it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his ideal $1,000,000 as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and gives him room to maneuver in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob is still trying to get the price closer to his ideal $1,000,000. There are still 7 rounds left in the negotiation, so there's room to try and get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price. He has 6 rounds left, so he's willing to risk pushing a little further.  $1,025,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer and puts pressure on her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above Bob's ideal price.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a significant risk that further negotiation will result in Alice walking away, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer guarantees a deal and saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John."
