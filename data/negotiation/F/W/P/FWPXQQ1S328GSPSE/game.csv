"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's true worth is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its quality and potential for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product has potential, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That's a substantial offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your hands.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting close.  However, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense for me. Let's make this simple â€“ $1,150,000 and we have a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  It's a fair price, and it lets us both walk away with something.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
