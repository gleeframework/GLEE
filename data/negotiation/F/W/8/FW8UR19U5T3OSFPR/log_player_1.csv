{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it at $950,000 positions it as a premium, but potentially attainable, acquisition for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob shows resistance, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
