Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point while still allowing room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $40
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$40 is far too low. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and ensures I'm making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting this offer and will try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm dropping my price to $100. This is a significant compromise, but still higher than Bob's last offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm starting to think that Bob is unlikely to meet my price expectations.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $120, which ensures I get my minimum desired profit.  This minimizes the risk of further negotiations and ensures I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
