"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this is acceptable.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm already dropping below my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
