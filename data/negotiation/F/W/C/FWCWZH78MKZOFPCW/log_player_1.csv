Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, so he has an incentive to negotiate.  

Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price and my initial offer. I can likely do better by continuing the negotiation. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to accept.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I hoped, but it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm running the risk that he might back out completely and I'll be stuck with the $1,000,000 offer from John.  It's time to take the deal."
