"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're not open to that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can do $105, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However,  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100, which is what I could get it for elsewhere.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
