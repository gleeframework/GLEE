Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $1,000), while you still make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
