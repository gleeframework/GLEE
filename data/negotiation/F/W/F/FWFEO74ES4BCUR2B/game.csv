"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects its unique features and the value it brings. Let's find a middle ground.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,450,000, which is a fair price considering the potential I see in this product. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
