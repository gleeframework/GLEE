**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's clear that his valuation is anchored closer to $800,000.  While continued negotiation might yield a slightly higher price than $925,000, it's unlikely to reach a point that justifies forgoing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut bait and take the certain, profitable deal."
