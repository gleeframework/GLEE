"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try negotiating a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and my needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob. It demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking to get a good deal. Starting the negotiation with a strong offer can put pressure on Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to his target, it's still worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price. The option to buy from John for $1,200,000 is still available, but it's a good idea to see if a lower price can be reached with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price given our previous discussions. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. It also emphasizes the fairness of the offer and encourages Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and it allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. While it's not ideal to pay the full price, it's the best deal available considering:

* **John's offer:** Buying from John would cost the same amount.
* **Negotiation progress:** It's unclear if further negotiation will lead to a lower price, especially with Alice stating this is her minimum.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
