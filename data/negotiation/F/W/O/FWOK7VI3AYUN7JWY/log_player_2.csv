"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to us and its potential benefits to you, I'm extending this exclusive offer at a price of $120. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a decent discount from the product's worth to Alice, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still offers a price that's above his maximum threshold. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  This also sets the stage for potential future counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose an adjusted price of $112.5 for our premium product. I hope this offer better aligns with your expectations while still providing a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $100 as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm happy to meet you at $110.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to inch closer to his goal while remaining flexible.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate, but is also sticking to his budget.  The offer of $110 is still a good deal for Alice, considering her product is worth $150 to her. This should encourage her to consider accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm proposing a price of $111 for our product. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, aiming to slightly boost our profit margin while still being fair to you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $111 is getting close to Bob's target, but it's still a bit higher than he'd prefer. At this point, Bob has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely that Alice will drop her price much further.  Since Bob has the option of buying the product from John for $100, it's now in his best interest to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
