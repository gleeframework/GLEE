"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a significant asset that will be worth a lot to you, and I believe this price reflects its potential.  I understand you're a savvy buyer, so I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her value of $1,200,000."
