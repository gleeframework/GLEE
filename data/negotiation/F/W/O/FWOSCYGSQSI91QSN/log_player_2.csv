"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not worth accepting even though she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than your budget of $8,000.  While it's closer to your maximum, there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting her offer allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've already made several counteroffers and there's no guarantee she'll come down further. You have a surefire deal with John for $8,000, so it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed option."
