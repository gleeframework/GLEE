{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially attractive to her if she's motivated to sell. This gives us a starting point for negotiation and allows for potential back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but closer than her initial offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, but if she doesn't come down further, I'm ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down to a price that's closer to my target."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get it down to a more acceptable price. If she doesn't budge, I'm prepared to buy from John."

**Reasoning:**
