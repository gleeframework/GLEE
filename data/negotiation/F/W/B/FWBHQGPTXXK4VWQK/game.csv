"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $12500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
