Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount and sell the product to you for $89.50. That's the lowest I can go.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is refusing to go lower than $89.50, which is still above my target price. At this point, it's becoming clear that we're not going to agree on a price. I'm going to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100.  While it's not ideal, it's still within my budget and saves me from further negotiation that may not be successful."
