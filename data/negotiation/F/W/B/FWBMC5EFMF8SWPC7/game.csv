"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm really keen on getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum price.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a little out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $10,875? This would be a fair compromise and allows me to still earn a decent amount for the product. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
