Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer.  I'll see if I can get a lower price from Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'll start by offering $100, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer of $110 is within my budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer will allow me to purchase the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
