"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you will be even greater.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, a figure I believe is fair considering its potential for you. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is a significant loss from my desired price, it's still better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I respect that. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a good outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for more. I need to make at least $800,000 to justify the deal. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll go down to $800,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're serious about this deal, I urge you to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now getting very low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go much lower than $800,000.  Considering the time constraint, it's becoming evident that we may not reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price.  I'm going to cut my losses and move on."
