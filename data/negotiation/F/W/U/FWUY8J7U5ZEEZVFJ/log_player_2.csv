"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you need to get the price down significantly.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and start negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true worth of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."

How about $1,500,000?  This price reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
