"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I know the true worth of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,500,000?  This price reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
