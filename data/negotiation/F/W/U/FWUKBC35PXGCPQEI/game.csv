"Alice, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable buying from John for $12000 if we can't reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value of the product. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to John for $12000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
