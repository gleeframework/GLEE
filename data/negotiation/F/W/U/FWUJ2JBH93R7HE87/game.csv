"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to accept $8,750? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to meet me at $8,750, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to the value you place on the product. How about we try $9,200? It's just a small step up, but it gets me a bit closer to where I'd like to be.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,900? It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",8900.0,Bob,6,
