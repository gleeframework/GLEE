"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $170, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 170}
```
This is a classic negotiation tactic where you start high to leave room for bargaining.  You know Bob values it at $80 and you value it at $100, so there's room to negotiate a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my desired $170."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $135?"", ""product_price"": 135} 

I'm aiming to close the gap quickly but still leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to pay more than $100 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is holding firm at $100, and while I'd prefer a higher price, getting my minimum acceptable price is better than risking a failed negotiation and settling for John's offer."
