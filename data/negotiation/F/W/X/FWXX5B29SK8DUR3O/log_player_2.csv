"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer on this incredible opportunity, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You know John will sell you the product for $800,000, which is within your budget and saves you $200,000 compared to Alice's offer. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
