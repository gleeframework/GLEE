"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
