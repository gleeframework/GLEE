"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm not sure if I can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll choose to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
