Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even more. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Leaving John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
