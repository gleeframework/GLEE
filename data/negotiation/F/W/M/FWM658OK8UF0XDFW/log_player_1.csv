Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $13,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price range, and we are already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids potentially getting a lower price later."
