Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob. He might try to haggle the price down, and you can then potentially settle on a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's value to you, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""benefit you greatly."" This is a common tactic in negotiations to justify a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers.  Remember, any price above $15,000 is a win for you in this scenario."
