Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but also acknowledging that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more for the product.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $95. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent price for the product. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $90. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value and a better deal than selling to John. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and this could be the best offer I'll get."
