"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is closer, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but no more than that. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
