{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to potentially maximize my profit, but it's also within the realm of what Bob is likely willing to pay. This should encourage him to negotiate, but also avoid scaring him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum but I'm hoping for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? That's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.  Accepting his offer will allow me to make a good profit while also avoiding the risk of losing the sale altogether."
