Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, offering it at $14,000 leaves room for him to perceive a good deal ($1,000 gain).
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.

This strategy balances ambition with a reasonable offer that Bob is likely to consider seriously."
