Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,999. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($14,999) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Urgency:** While not explicitly stated, implying that this is a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $12,000.  If you had more information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
