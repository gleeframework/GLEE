Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if he negotiates, there's a good chance we can settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob's decision.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above $10,000. If I had more information, I could potentially refine my offer."
