{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message also indicates that I'm open to negotiating, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can then evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.

**Next steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a better price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** The message starts by acknowledging Bob's interest and perspective, which shows respect and helps build a positive rapport.
* **Counteroffer:**  I propose a counteroffer of $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Mutually beneficial:** I frame the counteroffer as a way for both of us to get a good deal, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still being above my minimum threshold. By keeping the negotiation open and demonstrating flexibility, I hope to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum price.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. However, if the negotiations continue to stall, I am prepared to sell the product to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,750 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Addressing Bob's concerns:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations to show understanding and maintain a positive tone.
* **Counteroffer:** I propose a counteroffer of $9,250, which is halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $8,750. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this is a fair price that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer aims to continue negotiating while keeping my minimum threshold in mind. I hope that by demonstrating flexibility and appealing to Bob's sense of fairness, I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If Bob still rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling the product to John for $10,000."
