"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $12,000 opens the door to counteroffers and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob.**  He can get the product for $15,000 from John, so saving $4,500 is a significant advantage. 
* **Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.**  Alice might not be willing to go lower, and Bob could end up paying $15,000 to John. 

It's a good compromise that saves Bob a substantial amount of money."
