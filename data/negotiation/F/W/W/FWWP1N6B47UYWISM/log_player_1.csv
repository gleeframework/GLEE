``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate, while also leaving room for me to potentially earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. Could we possibly agree on $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there is room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $9,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
