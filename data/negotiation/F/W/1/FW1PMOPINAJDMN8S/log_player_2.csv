"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, Alice's offer is appealing. However, there's potential to save more money by negotiating. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you might get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $800,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that I am serious about negotiating and am willing to pay less.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering my budget of $1,000,000 and the potential to find a better deal with John.  If Alice rejects, I can adjust my offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for me. It's still within my budget, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away or raise her price. Accepting this offer guarantees me the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
