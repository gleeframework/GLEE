"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $120 is a decent price, but I want to see if I can get it lower. 
* **Strategy:** I'll start by rejecting and seeing if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate and gives me some room to maneuver.
* **Showing Interest:** I'm emphasizing my interest in the product to avoid completely shutting down the negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason (""a bit higher than I'm comfortable with"") makes the counteroffer more concrete and less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110 is a good price considering my goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Strategic Advantage:**  It's closer to my initial counteroffer, which shows Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer, and I'll have to deal with John's $150 price. 

I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product for $110."
