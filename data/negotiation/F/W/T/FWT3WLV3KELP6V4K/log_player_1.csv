Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1600000 to make it work.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,700,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle with John for a lower price."
