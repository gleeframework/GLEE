"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my costs as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your costs, $11500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  This would give us both a fair deal, and we can finalize the sale.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $10750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's try $12200. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have your price point, but $12200 is simply too high for me.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to stay below $11500.  I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $11250? This is my final offer.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
