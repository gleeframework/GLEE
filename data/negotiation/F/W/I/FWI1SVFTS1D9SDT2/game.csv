"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, and I do see the value in this product. However,  $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
