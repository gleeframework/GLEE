"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that's more in line with the product's actual value. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it, given its potential benefits to me.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can achieve for your business.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's immense value while still providing you with a significant return on investment. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a fair price, considering the potential benefits to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
