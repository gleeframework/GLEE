"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that's more in line with the product's actual value. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it, given its potential benefits to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what Bob can afford and still save money.
* **Justified:** Bob highlights the product's ""potential benefits"" to suggest he sees its value, while also implying that the asking price is too high.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Alice to respond and potentially begin a more focused negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and what it can achieve for your business.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's immense value while still providing you with a significant return on investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a gap of $100,000. 
* **Avoiding impulsive decisions:** Accepting at this point would mean losing out on potential savings.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and potentially puts pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a fair price, considering the potential benefits to my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** Bob again references the ""potential benefits"" to justify his offer and suggest he understands the product's value.
* **Setting a deadline:** The closing sentence creates a sense of urgency and pushes Alice to consider accepting the offer."
