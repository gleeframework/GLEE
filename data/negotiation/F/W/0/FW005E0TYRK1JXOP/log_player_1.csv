"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I highlight the product's unique value to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I use the phrase ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach balances a strong opening price with a willingness to talk and potentially compromise, aiming to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a compromise from my original offer and a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique value and position this offer as a ""significant discount."" 
* **Negotiation Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the conversation going and reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price point, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe the product is worth more than $950,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to $1 million.  I'm willing to continue negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its unique qualities. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer by dropping to $1,000,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within my desired price range.
* **Focus on Finality:** I use phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique qualities, hoping to sway him in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come very close to my desired price range.  At this point, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and ending up with John's offer of $800,000. Accepting this offer will guarantee a profit significantly higher than that, and it's worth risking missing out on a slightly higher price in the future."
