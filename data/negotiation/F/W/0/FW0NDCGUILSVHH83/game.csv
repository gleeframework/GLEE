"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's make a deal and avoid further negotiations.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
