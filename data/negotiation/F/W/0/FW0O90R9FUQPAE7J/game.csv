,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $11,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
