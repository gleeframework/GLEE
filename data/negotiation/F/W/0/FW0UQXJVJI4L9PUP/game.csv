"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is much too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, however,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price better reflects its inherent value and potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I could go as high as $750,000 if that would be agreeable to you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price considering the potential benefits it offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a big stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  That's the absolute maximum I can justify.  It's a fair offer considering the market value and my needs.",800000.0,Bob,6,
