"Alice, $150 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $80. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still out of my range. I'm sticking to my offer of $80.  It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,5,
