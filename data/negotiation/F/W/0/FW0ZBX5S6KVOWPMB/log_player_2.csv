Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.
