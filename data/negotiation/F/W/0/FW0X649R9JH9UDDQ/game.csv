"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, but I think this price is more reasonable considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
