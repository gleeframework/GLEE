"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $1,100,000, so my new offer is $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,150,000? This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so my new offer is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
