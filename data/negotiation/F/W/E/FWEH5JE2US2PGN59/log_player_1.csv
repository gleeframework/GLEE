Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $90?  I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
