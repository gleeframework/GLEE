"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it to be worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
