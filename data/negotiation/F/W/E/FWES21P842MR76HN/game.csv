,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $160? It's a fair price for a product this good.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I'm serious about buying it, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
