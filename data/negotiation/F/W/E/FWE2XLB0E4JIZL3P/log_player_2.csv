This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You're getting a $25,000 discount from John's price.
* **""Final Offer"":**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. You risk her sticking to her price or the negotiation breaking down, forcing you to buy from John at full price."
