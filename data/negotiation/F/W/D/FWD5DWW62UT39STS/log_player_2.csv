Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make one more concession: I'm counteroffering $9,300. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd still like to get the price lower, Alice is signaling this is her final concession. Accepting at $9,300 is a reasonable compromise, saving $2,700 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks either getting a price I'm happy with but close to the deadline, or Alice walking away, forcing me to buy from John anyway."
