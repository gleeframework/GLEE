Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price closer to $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed the product details again and believe that a price closer to $1780000 would be more aligned with its value and my budget. I hope this proposal works for you, and we can finalize the transaction.

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer.  While it's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still above the $1,750,000 he offered previously and above the $1,500,000 I could get from John.  The risk of continued negotiation is that Bob may walk away or lower his offer further, potentially bringing the price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Accepting now allows me to secure a sale with a decent profit."
