"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too High:**  However, I'm not starting ridiculously high, as I want to avoid immediately discouraging Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll get from the product. 

This initial offer is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, it does show he's interested in the product. There's room to negotiate towards a more favorable price.
* **No rush to sell to John:** I have 10 rounds to close a deal. Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm not drastically reducing my price, but showing some flexibility to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Focus on Value:**  Again, I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message conveys a willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, while still protecting my interests and aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $900,000.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is closer, but it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his offers are getting closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal with Bob that might get me closer to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'd love to close the deal at $900,000, it simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This offer is a significant compromise on my end and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm making a further concession, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests. 
* **Fair Value Argument:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify my asking price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encouraging, emphasizing cooperation to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and push the negotiation closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept a deal that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob's offer is a sign that he's getting more serious about closing the deal. We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **More negotiation is needed:** I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can potentially push the price up further. 

I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to meet in the middle. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Fair Value Argument:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price, making the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and encourages a quick resolution, expressing a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.

This counteroffer continues to push the price closer to my desired price, while still keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your attempts to find a compromise here. To be honest, my absolute top end is $1,010,000.  Take it or leave it, but that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has shown some flexibility, his offer of $1,010,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Bob has made it clear that his offer is his final offer. There's little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk going through more rounds of negotiation with no guarantee that we'll reach a deal. This could waste valuable time.

Selling to John at this point guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to go higher."
