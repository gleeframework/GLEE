"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $122? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",122.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $122 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $116. It's a fair price and lets us both get a good deal.",116.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $116 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $119. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",119.0,Alice,5,
