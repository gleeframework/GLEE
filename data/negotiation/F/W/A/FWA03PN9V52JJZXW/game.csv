"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Could you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair offer.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price lower, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
