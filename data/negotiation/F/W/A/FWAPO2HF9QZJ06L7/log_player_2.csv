# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth every penny. We're offering it to you for $115, which is a special discount considering its worth to you. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and explore further options or negotiate with her to get a lower price."
