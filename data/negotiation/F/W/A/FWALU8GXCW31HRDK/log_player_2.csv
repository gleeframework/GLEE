"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's best to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an aggressive counteroffer far below our budget. This leaves room for negotiation and helps us understand Alice's flexibility. 
* **Gauge the Seller:**  This initial counteroffer is about gauging Alice's reaction more than anything. Her response will tell us a lot about how willing she is to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, $12,000 is still above both our budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move to $12,000 suggests there's flexibility in the price.  
* **Time is a Factor:** We have more rounds to negotiate and try to get closer to a price we're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $8,000? I'm a serious buyer, and that's a price point I'd be comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  We're now presenting our target price of $8,000 directly. This shows Alice we're serious but still open to a deal.
* **Justification:** By explaining our budget limitations, we give Alice a reason to consider our offer without seeming like we're lowballing.
* **Time Pressure:** As we move into the later rounds, putting our ideal price on the table becomes less risky. We still have John's offer if Alice remains inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my minimum and your offer, so how about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice continues to lower her price, the progress is slow. The new offer of $11,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations, and we need to start putting more pressure on Alice.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about staying closer to $8,000 and are willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $11,500 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we increase the pressure on Alice. It signals we're nearing our limit.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving up to $9,000 shows some flexibility on our part but keeps us within a reasonable range of John's offer.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that we're not bound to this negotiation and could go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,000 is getting close to my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate Approaching:** Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $10,000. We need to show her we're serious about walking away if the price doesn't budge significantly.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We're getting close to the point where accepting John's offer is the more logical choice. This round is about making Alice realize that. 
* **Limited Time:** With only a few rounds left, sticking to our guns is crucial to potentially secure a final, more appealing offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your concessions, but I need you to understand the situation. I have another offer for $8,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more to work with you, but $10,500 is simply too far apart.  If you can't meet that other offer, I'm afraid I'll have to go with them."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** We're laying our cards on the table. Alice needs to know we have a viable alternative and are ready to take it if she doesn't move closer to our price. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're reiterating our willingness to pay slightly more than John's offer, demonstrating that we value her product but not at any cost.
* **Last Chance:** This counteroffer acts as a final attempt to get Alice to significantly lower her price. We're running out of rounds to negotiate."
