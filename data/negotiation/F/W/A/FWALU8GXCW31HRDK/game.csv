"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a significantly lower price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider something closer to $8,000? I'm a serious buyer, and that's a price point I'd be comfortable with.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my minimum and your offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $11,500 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider my other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,000 is getting close to my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concessions, but I need you to understand the situation. I have another offer for $8,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more to work with you, but $10,500 is simply too far apart.  If you can't meet that other offer, I'm afraid I'll have to go with them.",8000.0,Bob,8,
