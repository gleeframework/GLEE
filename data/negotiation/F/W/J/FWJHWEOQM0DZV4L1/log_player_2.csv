"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a great deal to you.  I understand you value it at $1,200,000, so this price allows for a significant profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. John's offer serves as a fallback option, so you have some leverage to negotiate."
