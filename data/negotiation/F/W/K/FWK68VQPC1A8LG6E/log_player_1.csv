Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it at $9,500 positions the price as a ""discount"" from your minimum. It might entice Bob to consider it a good deal, even though it's above his initial valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($10,000).  If Bob rejects your offer, you're not losing out."
