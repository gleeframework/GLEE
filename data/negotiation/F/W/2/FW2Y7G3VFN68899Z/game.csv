"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $95 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Can we meet in the middle?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite at $92.50. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $94. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the sale.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to pay $94. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $91 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we agree on that?",91.0,Bob,6,
