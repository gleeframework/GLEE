"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, given its market value and my own financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and provides a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which reflects a compromise on both our sides. It's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,275,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. This would allow us to reach an agreement and move forward with the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
