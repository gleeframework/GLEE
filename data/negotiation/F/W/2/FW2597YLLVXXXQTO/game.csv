"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $160? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. I can meet you in the middle at $170. Would that work for you?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $170 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $165? It's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford.",165.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $172.50. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know!",172.5,Alice,5,
