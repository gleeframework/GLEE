{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum.** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also leaves you some margin to work with.
* **It's a clear and concise message.**  This helps to avoid confusion and keeps the negotiation focused. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate.** By offering a price below your minimum, you're demonstrating flexibility and openness to a deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get a bit closer to what we're looking for."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That way, I can still get a good deal on the product, and you'll still get a decent price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82.50 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell it for less than $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about buying it, let's meet at $90.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm really not comfortable going up to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $90, so how about $86.25? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has shown some flexibility, his final offer of $86.25 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him any further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get the minimum price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower sale price."
