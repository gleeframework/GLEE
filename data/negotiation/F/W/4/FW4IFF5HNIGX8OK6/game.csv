"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
