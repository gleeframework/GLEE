"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal closer to $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer."
