"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000.  John offers a guaranteed price at that amount, making it the smarter financial decision at this point."
