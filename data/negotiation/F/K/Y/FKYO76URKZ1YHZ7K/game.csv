"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
