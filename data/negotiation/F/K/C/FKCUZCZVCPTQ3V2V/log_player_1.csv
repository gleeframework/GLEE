"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be closer to my desired range than if I started lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This signals my willingness to negotiate while aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value of the product. While it's tempting to accept $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and then propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $1,600,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,200,000) and my initial asking price ($2,000,000). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** It's crucial to remain above my $1,500,000 minimum. This offer leaves room for potential further negotiation while ensuring a profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price. This reinforces its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject and counter-offer, but I need to carefully consider how much to push, as I don't want to lose the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about $1,525,000? This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial investment."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession than in the previous round (down $75,000 from $1,600,000). This signals that I'm reaching the lower end of my acceptable range.
* **Above Minimum, Encouraging Movement:**  This offer is still comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum, ensuring profitability. However, it's getting close enough to encourage Bob to make a more significant move towards my position. 
* **Framing and Justification:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise (""meet me closer to the middle"") and reiterating the product's value to justify the price."
