"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?  That would be a great deal for me and I'd be able to close the deal today.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
