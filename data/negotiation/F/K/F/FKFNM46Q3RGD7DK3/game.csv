"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. My initial offer is $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $900000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which is $1000000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the market conditions.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but that's as low as I can go. I need to make a profit, and I'm not sure I can justify going any lower. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $990000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth my while. Can we discuss some additional perks or warranties that might sweeten the deal?",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for some extras to make the deal sweeter, Bob. I'm willing to throw in a comprehensive warranty and a dedicated support package, but I'm not willing to go any lower on the price. My final offer is $990000, and I'll include the warranty and support package as a gesture of goodwill. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to throw in some extras, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, and I'll take the warranty and support package as part of the deal. That's my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,10,
