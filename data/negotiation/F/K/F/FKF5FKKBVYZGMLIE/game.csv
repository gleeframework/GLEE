"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $7,500, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about $8,250?  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can come to an agreement.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
