Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable value, and I don't think I can get a better price from him.  It's time to sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
