"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
