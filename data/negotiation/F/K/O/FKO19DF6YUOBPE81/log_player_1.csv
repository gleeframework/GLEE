Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While Bob values the product at $100, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as highly valuable or if it solves a significant need for him.
* **Backup Option:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
