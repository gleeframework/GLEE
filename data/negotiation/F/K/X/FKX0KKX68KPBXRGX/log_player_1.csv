"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's more than what the product is worth to me but still leaves room for negotiation. This should gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can do better with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing some flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's higher than what Bob offered and closer to my desired value.  This should show Bob that I'm serious about selling but I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal with further negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a possibility, but I'm taking the safe bet and closing the deal with Bob."
