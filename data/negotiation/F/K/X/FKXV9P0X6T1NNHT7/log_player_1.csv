Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could give Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some wiggle room for Bob to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Alice knows she has John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so she's not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

This is just one strategy. Alice could:

* **Start higher:** She could try an even higher price, hoping Bob is eager and willing to pay a premium. 
* **Offer a deadline:** Creating urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Highlight the product's value:** Reminding Bob why the product is worth the price can make the offer more appealing."
