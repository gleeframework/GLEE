Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's estimated $15,000, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, Alice can be bolder in her initial offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
