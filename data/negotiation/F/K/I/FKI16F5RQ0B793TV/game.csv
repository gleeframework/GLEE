"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a great price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
