"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it presents you with a rare chance to acquire a valuable asset.  I understand this is a substantial investment, so please consider this offer carefully. If you choose not to proceed, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount, it's still above your budget. You can get the product from John for a much lower price of $800,000."
