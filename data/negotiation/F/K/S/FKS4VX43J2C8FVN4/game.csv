"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still allows you to make a good profit while giving me a price within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. This gives you a significant advantage and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I can offer $925,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move closer to a deal. Let's find common ground!",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a great compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,5,
