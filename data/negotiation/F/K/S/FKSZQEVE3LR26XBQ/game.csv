,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both something to work with.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7000? I think that's a fair price considering I'm willing to buy the product from John for $8000 if we can't come to an agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7750? This would be a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $7750 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",7250.0,Bob,6,
