Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I'm offering it to him at that price.  This ensures I get the maximum value for the product. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for the same amount, so there's no risk in offering the full value."
