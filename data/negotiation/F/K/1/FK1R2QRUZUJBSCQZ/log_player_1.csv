Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
