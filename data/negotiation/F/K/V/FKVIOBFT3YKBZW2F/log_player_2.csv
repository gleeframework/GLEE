# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is a good compromise. It's still lower than I initially hoped for, but it's a significant saving compared to buying from John for $8,000.  It's a good deal for me."
