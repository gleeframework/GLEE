# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,600.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on not going below $6,800. We're in round 9, and she's repeated her previous offer.  While I could try to push her a tiny bit further in the last round, there's a risk she won't budge. Accepting $6,800 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price."
