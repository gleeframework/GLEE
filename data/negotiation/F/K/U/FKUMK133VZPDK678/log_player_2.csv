"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really value. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is less than your maximum budget of $150, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her."
