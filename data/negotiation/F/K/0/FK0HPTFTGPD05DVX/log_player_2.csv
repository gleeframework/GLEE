"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is far beyond your budget of $80. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $80 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum offer of $80, making it clear that this is my limit.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in selling the product quickly and consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, $140 is still too high.  I'm going to try to negotiate further, as I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product.  $100 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still within my budget.  I'm also stating this is my final offer to put pressure on Alice to make a decision."
