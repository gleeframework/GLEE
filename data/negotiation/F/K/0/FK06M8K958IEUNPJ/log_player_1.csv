``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, aiming for a 10% profit. It's reasonable and gives Bob room to negotiate.  I'm ready to adjust the price if needed, but I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try and counteroffer him to see if we can find a price we're both happy with. John is a reliable backup, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal with Bob yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it ensures I can make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,420,000? That's a bit lower than your last offer, but it's still a good price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,420,000 is closer to my minimum price than his previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,380,000 for the product. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've gone back and forth with Bob several times, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
