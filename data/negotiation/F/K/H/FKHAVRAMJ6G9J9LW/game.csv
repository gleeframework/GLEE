"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is way beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $8,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I've carefully considered my budget, and $8,000 is truly the most I can spend on this. It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price. If you're not able to meet that, I understand, but I may need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,000, which is $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,7,
