"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm confident this product will bring you immense value exceeding that amount. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
