Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit at that price. The product holds significant value to me, and I believe a price closer to $750000 would be more fair for both of us.  This price still allows you a good profit, while making the purchase more appealing to me. Let's continue this negotiation and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
