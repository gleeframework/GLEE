"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $95. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you benefit from the product's worth. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $100. Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, Bob can get the product from John for $100.  Since Bob is focused on saving as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
