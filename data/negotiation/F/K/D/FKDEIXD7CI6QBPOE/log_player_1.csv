{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation with Bob. It also shows you're willing to compromise, which could make him more likely to accept. If he rejects, you'll need to be ready to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a good price for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell the product, I can't afford to let it go for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $950,000 is still too low. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in this product, but I think we're getting close to the point where I need to consider buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. That's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Even though he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not comfortable accepting it.  I'm going to sell the product to John instead, as he is willing to pay my desired price."
