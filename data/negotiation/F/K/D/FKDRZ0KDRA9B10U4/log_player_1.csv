Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $130 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially still reach a price above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects this high price, it might indicate he's not willing to pay much more than his perceived value ($100)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to negotiate a slightly higher price. We'll try to meet him halfway between his offer and our initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $115, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This counteroffer still keeps us comfortably above our $100 minimum.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** It's a reasonable counteroffer that might encourage Bob to accept, avoiding further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I would like to stick to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Bob seems firm on $100.  Squeezing out a few extra dollars might not be worth the risk of him walking away. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting his offer guarantees the sale at our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now allows us to move on."
