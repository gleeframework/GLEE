"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
