"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The offer is below Bob's perceived value ($10,000), which makes it more likely he'll counteroffer, opening up further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't afford $17,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly below my desired price and my initial offer.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's a chance Bob will increase his offer in subsequent rounds, especially if he sees my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I want to try to maximize my profit if possible. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's still getting a good deal at this price.
* **Direct and clear:** I'm stating my counteroffer clearly and inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm still looking to keep within my budget of $12,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No progress:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $12,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 4, and I'm running out of time to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, which is a much safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, but I will also seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't show a willingness to come up on his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but unfortunately, $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is a significant concession from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I'm expressing my desire to make a deal quickly, implying that further negotiations might be difficult.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation may not be worth the risk of losing time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. I'm still aiming for $12,000. Can we try to get closer to that number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No progress:** Bob is still stuck at his initial offer of $12,000, showing no willingness to budge.
* **Time is running short:** We're in round 6, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. 
* **John's offer is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a significantly better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit.  I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
