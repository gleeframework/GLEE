"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same numbers.  How about we split the difference - $10,750 and we have a deal?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the way you think, splitting the difference was a good idea! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once more.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is my final offer.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000. I'll meet you at $11,500, and that's my final offer. If we can't meet there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
