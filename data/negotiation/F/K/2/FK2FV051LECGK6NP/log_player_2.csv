Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000. I'll meet you at $11,500, and that's my final offer. If we can't meet there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly sticking close to her price and is unlikely to go below $11,500.  While it's possible to push her further in the last round, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her walking away. Buying from John for $15,000 is not ideal, but it guarantees getting the product and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing after ten rounds."
