"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in the product, $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000, but I need to be sure it aligns with my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for you in the long run. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  $900000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $825000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
