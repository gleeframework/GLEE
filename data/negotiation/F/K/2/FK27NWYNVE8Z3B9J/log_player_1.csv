Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, which I believe is worth a significant amount to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in the product, $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000, but I need to be sure it aligns with my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than my minimum of $800,000, I'm not confident that Bob is being entirely honest about his budget.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for you in the long run. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $900000 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $825000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum of $800,000.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle with John for $800,000. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to take it."
