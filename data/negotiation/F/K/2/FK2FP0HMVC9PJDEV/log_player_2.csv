"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects a fair compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This allows you a substantial gain while ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.  Consider this your exclusive chance to acquire this asset at a price below its true market value. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
