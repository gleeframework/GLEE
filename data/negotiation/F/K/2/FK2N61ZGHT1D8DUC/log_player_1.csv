Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be highly valuable to your business. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's value to me, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 just yet.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would ensure a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once again and settle on $800,000. This price would allow us both to walk away happy and satisfied."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
