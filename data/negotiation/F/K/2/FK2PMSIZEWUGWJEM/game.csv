"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $12,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
