"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,200 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's try to close the deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
