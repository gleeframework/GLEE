"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves me space for a potential counteroffer. It's important to be clear and direct about my intentions and to open a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is more than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that is still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired price point. I'm highlighting the value of the deal for Bob to try and persuade him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the minimum I am willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John for $150. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
