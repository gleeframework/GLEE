"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far above your maximum price of $100. It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer, or even buy from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer, knowing Alice likely won't accept immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to increase my offer if needed. I'm aiming to get as close to my maximum price of $100 as possible without risking walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is slightly lower, it's still above my maximum price of $100.  I will continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price, keeping the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also still unwilling to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Alice to accept, especially with the looming threat of me buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still above my maximum of $100. I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal without going over my budget. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, and I'm willing to risk it to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to my maximum price of $100.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am unwilling to pay more. Since Alice's offer is still higher, I'm hoping she will accept my final counteroffer, especially as I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $100.  While I'm close to reaching a deal with Alice, the risk of her refusing my next counteroffer and ending up with nothing is too high. It's better to be safe and buy from John for my desired price."
