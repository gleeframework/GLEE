"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $17500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $18000 is still a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to meet me at $16500?",16500.0,Bob,6,
