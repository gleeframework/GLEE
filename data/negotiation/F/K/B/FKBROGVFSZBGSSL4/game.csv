"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget for this purchase is strictly under $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a bit of wiggle room.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,200. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial situation, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,400 for this to work. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my financial situation, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am unable to meet you at $10,400. My final offer is $10,300. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10300.0,Bob,6,
