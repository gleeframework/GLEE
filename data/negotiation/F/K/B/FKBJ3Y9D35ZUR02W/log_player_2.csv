"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is far above your budget, so rejecting the offer is the logical choice.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This is the maximum price you are willing to pay, so this is your first and best offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate with Alice allows you to potentially get a better price or ultimately buy from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

You're willing to go slightly above your initial offer, but still want to stay below $140. This shows Alice you're serious about buying, but also willing to walk away if she's not flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your maximum.  It's likely Alice will continue to negotiate, but there's no guarantee she'll come down to your desired price. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $120, saving yourself potential time and frustration from further negotiations."
