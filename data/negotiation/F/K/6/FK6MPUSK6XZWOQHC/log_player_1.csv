Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will reveal how interested he is and provide insight into his perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives me a safety net. I can always negotiate down with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale."
