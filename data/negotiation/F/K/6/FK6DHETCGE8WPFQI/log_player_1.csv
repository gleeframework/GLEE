"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer, allowing you to work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You need to hold firm on your position and aim for a higher price. It's important to remember you have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for a price you're comfortable with.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is my bottom line. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit in this investment."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from your initial offer but remains above Bob's initial offer. It signals your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to your minimum acceptable value. The message emphasizes the product's value and the potential benefits for Bob, encouraging him to reconsider. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal within the next few rounds."
