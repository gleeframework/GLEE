{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum value of $1,200,000 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential for Bob's business to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using open-ended language like ""Let me know your thoughts"" to signal I'm open to negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I'm not desperate for a sale and have a backup option in John. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the potential for a successful negotiation with Bob, without jeopardizing my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  I'm offering $1,000,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Finality and urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my proposal seriously.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product, subtly implying that he might be missing out on a good opportunity by not accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **No significant progress:**  Bob's offer is only $100,000 higher than his initial offer, indicating he might not be willing to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my minimum.

This decision prioritizes securing a guaranteed profit over potentially prolonging negotiations with Bob, who might not ultimately agree to a price that meets my needs."
