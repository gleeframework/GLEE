"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me and her offer is way too high.
