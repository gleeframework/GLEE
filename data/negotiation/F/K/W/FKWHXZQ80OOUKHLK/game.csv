"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for me. How about we settle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000, Bob. I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
