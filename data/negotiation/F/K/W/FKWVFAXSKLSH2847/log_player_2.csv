"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this deal and be willing to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You'll use this if the negotiation fails, but you're aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating that you're serious about getting a good price. It also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message highlights that you understand the product's value but are working within your own budget constraints.  
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** This encourages Alice to be open to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **More negotiation room.** You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility, so there's likely room to bring the price down further.
* **John is a fallback option.** If the negotiations fail, you still have the option to buy from John, but you want to see if you can get a better price from Alice."

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
