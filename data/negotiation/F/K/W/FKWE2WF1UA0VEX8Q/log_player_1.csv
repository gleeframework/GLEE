Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for my minimum price, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation: 
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * I make a profit of $100,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale above my minimum."
