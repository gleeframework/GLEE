"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm confident this product can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $11,750?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,750 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,125?"", ""product_price"": 12125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,937.50.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,937.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below your $12,000 minimum.  At this point, the difference in price increases is getting smaller and it's unlikely Bob will meet your minimum within the remaining rounds. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
