"Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. Let's split the difference and see if $11,000 works for you. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $8,000. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. Can we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
