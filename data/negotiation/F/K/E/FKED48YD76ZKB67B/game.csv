"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
