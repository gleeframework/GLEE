{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable, considering my maximum budget of $8,000 and Alice's potential profit margin."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. It's important to stay firm and remember my goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price with her offer of $11,000. I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $9,500.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but am still aiming for a price that works for me. I believe this is a fair offer that could be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm also aware that I can still buy from John for $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is only $500 away from my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $10,000.  This shows that I am very close to accepting a deal, but still need a slight discount to close the deal. I believe this is a fair offer that could be accepted, and will likely be accepted, as Alice is getting closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is only $200 above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to my budget,  I'm now very close to a deal and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm choosing to accept this offer as I'm confident I won't get a better deal with the limited rounds remaining."
