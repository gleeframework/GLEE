"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This is to leave room for negotiation and hopefully get a higher price.  It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product. This high starting offer might encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to eventually find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 meets my minimum value, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum. It's important to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept. This move shows willingness to compromise, but also protects my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
