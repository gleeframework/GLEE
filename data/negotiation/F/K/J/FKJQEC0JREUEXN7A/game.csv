"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to do $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50?  ",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88.50. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal and offer $90. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,5,
