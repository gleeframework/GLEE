"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I know you'll benefit from it.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're right, $14,000 is getting closer.  To be fair, I could come down slightly to $16,500, but that's my final offer.",16500.0,Alice,5,
