"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a little above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,875.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",10875.0,Alice,5,
