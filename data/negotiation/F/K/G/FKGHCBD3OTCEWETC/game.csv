"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on this product. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",9250.0,Alice,5,
