"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're putting on this product. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counter-offering. It's worth exploring if there's further room for negotiation before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 9250}
