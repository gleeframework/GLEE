"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go below $8000, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. How about we meet at $7800? It's a bit closer to my minimum, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give me a slight discount, but $7800 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so how about $7400? Would you be willing to consider that price?",7400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7400. How about we meet at $7600? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to get the sale done.",7600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7600 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so how about $7300? I'm hoping we can get closer to a deal.",7300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to think it's time to wrap up this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $7400, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",7400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7400, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're willing to sell it to me for $7000, I'm ready to make the deal.",7000.0,Bob,10,
