"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's already $2,000 below the market value of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still $2,000 above your maximum price.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is still a bit below my target price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your target, it's still a bit high.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum and your minimum. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  You're only $200 away from your maximum price with John, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer.  It's better to lock in the $8,000 price with John and avoid further negotiation."
