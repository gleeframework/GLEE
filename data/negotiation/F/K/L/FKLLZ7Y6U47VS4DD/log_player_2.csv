"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
