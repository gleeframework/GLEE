"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $137.50? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",137.5,Alice,5,

"I've already offered you $137.50, Bob, and you've come back with the same offer twice. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's my final one: $135. If that's not acceptable, I'm moving on.",135.0,Alice,7,

"I've given you a good deal, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $132, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not serious about buying, I'm moving on.",132.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",125.0,Bob,10,
