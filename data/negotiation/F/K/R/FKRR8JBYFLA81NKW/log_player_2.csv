"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is better than $100, it's still above the product's value to Bob ($100).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Reasoning:** The message emphasizes Bob's desire to find a mutually beneficial price, making the counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $85 is still above the product's value to Alice ($80), leaving room for her to potentially accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's value:** $90 is still above Bob's maximum price of $100 for the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice's offer shows she's willing to compromise, so there's still room for a better deal for Bob. 
* **Strategic approach:** By rejecting again, Bob maintains the pressure on Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise while still trying to stay below his $100 limit.
* **Strategic positioning:** $87 is still a fair price for Alice, considering the product is worth $80 to her.
* **Urgency:**  The message adds a sense of urgency, implying that Bob is ready to move on if an agreement isn't reached soon."
