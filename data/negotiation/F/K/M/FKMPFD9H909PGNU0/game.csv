"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
