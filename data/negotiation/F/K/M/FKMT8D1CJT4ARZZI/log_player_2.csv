$75 is a good offer, but it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and try to counter."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $77.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$77.50 is still a good deal, and it's likely I won't get a lower offer from Alice.  I'll accept and move on."
