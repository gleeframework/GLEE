Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $700,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway at $850,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still more than I can justify. Let's compromise at $750,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and at this point, accepting John's offer for $800,000 is the safer and more profitable option. It avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling below the guaranteed sale price."
