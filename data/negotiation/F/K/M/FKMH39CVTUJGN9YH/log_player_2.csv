"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget and significantly more than the product is worth to you. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $700,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly reducing the price.  It's a bold move, but it shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but not at her initial price. This strategy forces Alice to either accept a lower price or continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above what you are willing to pay.  You are aiming to save as much as possible and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still more than I can justify. Let's compromise at $750,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. This strategy keeps the pressure on Alice to accept a lower price or continue negotiating."
