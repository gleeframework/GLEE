Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still offer Bob an incentive to buy. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher gives you room to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  Mentioning it's a ""steal"" implies there might be other interested buyers, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Why not other prices?**

* **$150 or higher:** Bob won't buy because it's more than he values the product.
* **$120-$130:** This leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. You can likely get more from Bob.
* **$140:**  This is close, but leaving a little extra wiggle room for negotiation is strategically better."
