"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $18000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $15000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you a slight discount, so I'm offering the product to you for $15500. This is my final offer on this price point, so let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
