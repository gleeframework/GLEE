Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'm not going to sell the product to Bob for $8,000, that's way below my minimum price. And selling it to John for $15,000 is a better option than selling it to Bob for $8,000.
