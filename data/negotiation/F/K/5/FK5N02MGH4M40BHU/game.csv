"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,200. Let me know if that works for you.",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500, which is $8,750. This is the best I can do.",8750.0,Alice,5,
