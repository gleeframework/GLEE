Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but I'm really only willing to pay $12000 for the product.  It's my maximum budget and I'm sure we can both benefit from a deal at this price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for the bare minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can't go higher than $12500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a fair compromise. While I'd prefer more, I'm already getting a good price and there's a risk I could lose him completely if I keep pushing. It's better to secure the deal at this point and move on."
