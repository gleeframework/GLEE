"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $17000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I can't go lower than $15000 on this product. It's a one-time opportunity, and this is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let me know, but I need to hear back from you soon.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
