"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice's initial offer is exactly that, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This sets the negotiation in motion and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal.  While this is a bold move, it leaves room for negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a slightly better price by continuing to counteroffer."

{""product_price"": 10500}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched Bob's counteroffer from the previous round. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's achieved his goal of getting a significant discount from the initial price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a lower price without risking further negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate."
