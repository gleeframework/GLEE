Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $100 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
