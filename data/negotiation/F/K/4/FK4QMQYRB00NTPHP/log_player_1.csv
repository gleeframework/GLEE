"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting message to build rapport.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  I'm aiming for a price higher than $80, my minimum.  $90 is closer to my target, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. This might encourage Bob to raise his offer in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to counteroffer Bob in the next round.  Since he's willing to go up to $90, I'll likely offer a price slightly below $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $95? This still leaves a good deal of value for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer than mine, but still higher than his counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value the product offers to Bob to justify my price.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to respond favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $90 again. It's still within your range and keeps me within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  Bob is offering $90, which is my minimum acceptable price. I've had a few rounds of negotiation, and while I could potentially get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is high.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's wise to secure a sale close to my target price.  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**  Since I've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete and the product will be sold for $90."
