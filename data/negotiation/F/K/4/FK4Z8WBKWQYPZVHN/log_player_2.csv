"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $11,500 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm serious about wanting this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** $11,250 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.
* **John's Price:**  $15,000 is significantly higher.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving from $12,000 to $11,250.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible. Accepting the offer secures a good price that's still below John's price."
