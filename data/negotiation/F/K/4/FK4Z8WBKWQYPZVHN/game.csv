"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm serious about wanting this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is a slight concession from my previous offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
