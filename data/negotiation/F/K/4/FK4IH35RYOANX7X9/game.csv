"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
