"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
