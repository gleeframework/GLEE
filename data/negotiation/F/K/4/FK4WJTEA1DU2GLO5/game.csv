"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make a counter-counteroffer of $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1280000 and $1400000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1350000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
