"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and will be a great investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1600000, so how about $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000 as a final compromise. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
