**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing signs of being firm on her price.  She's stated this is her ""best price"". While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge much, and we might end up with a less favorable outcome in later rounds. Accepting at $1,150,000 secures a reasonable deal."
