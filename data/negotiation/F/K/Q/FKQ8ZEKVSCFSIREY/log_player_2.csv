"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum and her minimum. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and probes her willingness to move down.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is friendly and expresses interest while clearly stating our price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down $20, which is a good sign, but we're still aiming for a much lower price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle on $85? That's a fair deal."",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  We're aiming to meet somewhat close to the middle ground between her offer ($100) and our previous offer ($70). 
* **Direct and Fair:** The message proposes a specific price and frames it as a reasonable compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're getting closer to Alice's minimum price ($80), but we want to see if she'll meet us closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! $85 is a bit close to your original offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we try $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only came down by $8, indicating she might be holding firm closer to her minimum.
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the rounds. While we have time, continuing to negotiate in small increments might not be the most efficient use of our leverage. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We need to keep in mind that John offers the product for $150. Accepting a price too close to that diminishes the value of negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting closer. I'm willing to move up a little, but $92 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be open to $88?"",
 ""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're signaling flexibility by increasing our offer slightly, but not by a significant amount. This shows we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the budget reinforces that our price ceiling is firm. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** We end with a question to gauge her willingness to move further down. This keeps the negotiation active."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob! $88 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we try $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:** Alice's offer is a very small concession ($3), suggesting she might be trying to extract as much value as possible before reaching her limit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We have four rounds left, and it's becoming riskier to continue with minor concessions. Alice may be betting on us caving in as time runs out.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** It's time to remind Alice that we have an alternative and we're serious about our price limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $95 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I do value this product, but I have a firm budget. I'm willing to offer you $90.  If we can't agree on this, I might have to consider other options."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is our final offer, reflecting a willingness to compromise but staying firm on our budget. 
* **Introducing Urgency:**  By explicitly mentioning ""other options"" (John), we create a sense of urgency and signal that this is our bottom line. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, avoiding ambiguity and reiterating our position.
* **Strategic Timing:** By presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer with a few rounds to spare, we give Alice time to consider and potentially accept before we're forced to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. $90 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'll meet you halfway between $90 and my original offer. How about we try $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unreasonable Counter:** Alice's offer of $110 is a significant jump backward in the negotiation.  She's either not negotiating in good faith or drastically misjudged our willingness to budge.
* **Limited Time:** With only one round left, we're unlikely to bridge the gap between $90 and $110. Alice is probably aware of this and might be hoping we panic and accept a bad deal.
* **John's Guarantee:** John's offer of $150 is a known and acceptable fallback. While not ideal, it's far better than paying $110 at this point. 

**It's clear that Alice is unwilling to meet our needs within a reasonable price range.  It's time to walk away and secure the product from John for $150, avoiding the risk of overpaying in the final round.**"
