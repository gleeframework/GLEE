"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you need a fair price.  How about $13,500? That's a significant move on my part.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $13,500 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  This is a very fair price and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm feeling the pressure to get this done. $15,000 is the most I can offer.  If you're not willing to meet that, I'll have to go with John.",15000.0,Bob,6,
