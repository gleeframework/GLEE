{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and what I believe the product is worth. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair offer considering current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is a fair compromise considering the market conditions. It's also very close to my minimum price, so I'm happy to accept this deal."
