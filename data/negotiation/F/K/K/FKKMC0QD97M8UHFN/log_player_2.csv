{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price ($120). There's room for negotiation to save money. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still significantly lower than my maximum price, but hopefully high enough to be attractive to Alice. I'm aiming to get a good deal without risking too much by going too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my counteroffer, and it's still a good deal for me. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
