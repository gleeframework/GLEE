"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting her offer saves you $200,000."
