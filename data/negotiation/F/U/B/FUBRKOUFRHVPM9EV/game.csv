"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,200,000 for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's significantly below the product's actual value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
