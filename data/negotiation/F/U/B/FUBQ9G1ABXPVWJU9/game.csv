,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $9,000 for the product? This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, how about we settle on a price of $8,900? This is slightly above your last offer but still within a reasonable range given the product's worth to you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. ",8800.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and the price you're proposing, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about we set the price at $8,850? This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",8850.0,Alice,7,
