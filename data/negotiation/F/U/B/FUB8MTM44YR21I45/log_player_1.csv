Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. $9,500 is still a bit low, but it's a good starting point for the counter-offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to try to get a little closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,700?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to you, I believe $9,650 is a reasonable price for us to agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,650 is a fair compromise considering we're nearing the end of our rounds.  It's also important to note that I'm getting closer to my ""minimum acceptable"" price of $12,000 with each round.  Accepting his offer is the best move for me at this point."
