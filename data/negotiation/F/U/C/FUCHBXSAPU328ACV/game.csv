"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can make it work.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm going to have to be careful with my finances. I'd like to make another offer of $12,800. I'm really close to my limit, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12800.0,Bob,6,
