``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, aiming to increase his interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price, avoiding a hardline stance.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation fails."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

* **Backup option:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still being within the range of a potential deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident we can make it work."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm going to have to be careful with my finances. I'd like to make another offer of $12,800. I'm really close to my limit, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.
* **Backup plan is the best option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation. 

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gains are minimal, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price than I could get from John."
