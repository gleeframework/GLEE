Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $10,500. This is still a good profit margin for me and leaves some room for further negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my desired price range."

```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm now at a point where I've already gone below my ideal price.  To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale entirely, I'm going to accept the offer from John and sell the product for $12,000."
