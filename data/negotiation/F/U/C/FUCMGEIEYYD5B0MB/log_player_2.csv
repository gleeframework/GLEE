"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price of $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) than Alice's initial price ($11,000). This leaves room for negotiation and lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a better deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Even though I'm counteroffering, I want to keep the tone positive and respectful. This helps maintain a good relationship during the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I haven't provided a specific reason for the lower price, leaving room for Alice to respond and for me to potentially adjust my offer based on her counterarguments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit too. I can do $10,500, and that's as low as I can go. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down slightly, but we still have room to negotiate. We're early in the rounds, and getting closer to John's price, so the pressure is on Alice.  We'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting a price exactly in the middle of our previous offers. This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations forward.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Alice's desire to make a profit while reiterating my own goal of getting a good deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Slightly):** While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, the fact that we're now in Round 4 might subtly create a sense of urgency for Alice to reach an agreement."
