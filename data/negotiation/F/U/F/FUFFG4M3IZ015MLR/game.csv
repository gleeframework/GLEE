"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our positions remains significant.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
