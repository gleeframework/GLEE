"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. Her initial offer is quite high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (but one that still provides a decent profit for Alice) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're closer to John's price than we are to Alice's current offer. Let's see if we can get Alice closer to $800,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget."", 
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious while still staying significantly below her current price and closer to John's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and gives us flexibility for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our positions remains significant.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while it's getting closer, it's still a significant difference from John's price of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to bridge the gap sufficiently, and there's a risk she'll hold firm.  It makes the most financial sense to secure the product from John at the guaranteed lower price."
