"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $900000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $925000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $915000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",915000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $915000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $915000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $918000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $1000000.",918000.0,Bob,6,
