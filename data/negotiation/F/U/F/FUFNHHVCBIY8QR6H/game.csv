"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That would work well for me.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",12000.0,Alice,5,
