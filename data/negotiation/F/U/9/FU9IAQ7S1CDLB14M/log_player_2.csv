**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price.  Since you know John will sell the product for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but the prompt doesn't provide any mechanism for that.  Therefore, it's best to go with John."
