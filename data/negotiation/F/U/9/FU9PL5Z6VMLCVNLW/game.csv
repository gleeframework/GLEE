"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering it's more than half of your value. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's value to me. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but it also needs to work within my budget. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in lowering your price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's value to me.

Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
