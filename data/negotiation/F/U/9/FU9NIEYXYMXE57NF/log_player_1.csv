Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is possible are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

Aim high but leave Bob some room to feel like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair offer"" position the sale positively.
* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation but staying well above your minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but never below $1,200,001).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive opening price could be considered.

Let me know what you think of this offer, and we can adjust it based on any additional information or preferences you have!"
