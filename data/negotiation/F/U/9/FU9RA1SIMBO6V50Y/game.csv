"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go all the way down to $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
