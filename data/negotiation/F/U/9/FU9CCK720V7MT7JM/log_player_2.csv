"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to get a better price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for the product.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** Bob's initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above his own maximum value. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals his seriousness.
* **Room for compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and allows both parties to find a middle ground.  
* **Friendly tone:** The message maintains a polite and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Jhon's price:**  Alice's offer is only $25,000 higher than what Bob can buy the product for from Jhon.
* **Room for better deal:** Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, potentially getting a better deal than what Jhon offers. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk that Alice might reject Bob's next counteroffer, there's also the potential reward of getting the product for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet at $980,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than Jhon's price:** This counteroffer is only $20,000 higher than what Bob can buy the product for from Jhon, giving him some wiggle room.
* **Further compromise:** This offer shows Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway while still trying to get a good deal. 
* **Maintain friendly tone:** The message remains polite and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $980000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Equal to Jhon's price:** Alice's offer is now the same price as what Bob can buy the product for from Jhon. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** At this point, there's no real benefit to continuing the negotiation with Alice. 
* **Minimize risk:**  Buying from Jhon guarantees Bob gets the product for his maximum price. There's no chance of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and making Bob lose the deal."
