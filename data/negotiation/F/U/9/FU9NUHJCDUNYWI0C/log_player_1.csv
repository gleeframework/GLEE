"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. It's still above my minimum, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 yet. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum, showing I'm getting close to my bottom line. This should incentivize Bob to make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting close, but Bob's offers are still below my minimum profit. I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll take that option."
