"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and values the product significantly less than you do. By rejecting her initial offer, you create an opportunity to potentially secure a lower price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
