"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,500. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,750 is just not going to work for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit more and offer the product for $9,250.  I think this is a good compromise that benefits us both.  Let's make this deal happen!",9250.0,Alice,7,
