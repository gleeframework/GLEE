Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than the product's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a price that's more fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as it's the value the product holds for me. I'm hoping Bob will agree to this price, as it's a fair compromise."
