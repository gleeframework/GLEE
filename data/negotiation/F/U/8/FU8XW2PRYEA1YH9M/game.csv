"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
