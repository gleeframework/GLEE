Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to buy while still leaving room for negotiation. $1,400,000 is a fair starting point, as it's a substantial discount but still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You're determined to save as much as possible. You have time to continue negotiating, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.  It's also important to note that John is still a viable option at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you are willing to meet halfway. $1,550,000 is a significant price reduction from Alice's last offer, but still within your budget and leaves room for a potential agreement. You are getting closer to your desired price and demonstrating your commitment to buying the product while still being firm about your price range."
