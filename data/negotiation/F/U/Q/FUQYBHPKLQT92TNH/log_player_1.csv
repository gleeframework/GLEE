"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" aims to frame the product as highly desirable, potentially shifting Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language implies willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'll aim slightly higher in the next round to see if I can secure a better deal. I'm not willing to accept his offer immediately when I have 8 rounds and the potential to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $1,450,000?"" ,
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and make a significant concession to demonstrate flexibility.
* **Target Price:**  My new offer is halfway between his offer and my initial ask. This leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Phrasing my response as a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $1,200,000. He's signaled this is his upper limit twice now. However, I still have plenty of rounds left, and I'm not feeling pressured. I'll make another small concession to see if I can entice him further, but I'll be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer soon if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from. Let's make this work - how about $1,325,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making another concession, but this time a smaller one. This signals that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is a ""significant reduction"" and a ""fair deal,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Limited Flexibility:** I'm avoiding open-ended questions in this round, indicating less willingness to move substantially from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly fixed on $1,200,000.  He has not budged from this price in three rounds, indicating he's unlikely to go higher. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer, securing the $1,200,000. While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away and getting nothing."
