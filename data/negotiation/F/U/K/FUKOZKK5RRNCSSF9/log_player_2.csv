"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,500 is better than John's offer of $8,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering. He has nothing to lose by rejecting the initial offer and seeing if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $7,500 to $7,200. This is a good price for Bob, as it is lower than John's offer of $8,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers or that he could end up paying more if he goes back and forth with Alice. Accepting Alice's offer at $7,200 ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids any potential risks."
