"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
