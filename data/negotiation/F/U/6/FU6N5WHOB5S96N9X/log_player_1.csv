Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $2,000,000. I know this product is highly sought after and believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. "",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message implies its high value and desirability.  
* **""First Mover Advantage"":** By being the first to set the price, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims high. Bob might outright reject the offer. However, you have a safety net with John's offer.
* Gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy if he seems turned off by the initial high price."
