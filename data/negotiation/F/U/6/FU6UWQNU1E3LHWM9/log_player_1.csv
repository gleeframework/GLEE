"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($120), but knowing that Bob values it at $120.  This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little more for this product.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering $125, which is still slightly above my minimum but shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I've reached my minimum acceptable price with Bob, and the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds.  It's unlikely I'll be able to get a higher price, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $120."
