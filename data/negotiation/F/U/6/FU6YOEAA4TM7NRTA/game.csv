"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
