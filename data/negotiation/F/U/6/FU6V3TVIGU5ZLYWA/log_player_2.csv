"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's unique features and potential returns. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. My offer of $600,000 is a strong counter, leaving room for negotiation while still being well within my budget.
* **Message:** The message conveys my interest in the product but establishes a clear starting point for negotiation. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm eager to see if Alice is willing to come down in price. If she rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers strategically, keeping my maximum budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm still very confident in the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $750000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but still higher than I'm comfortable with. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and hopefully secure a more favorable price."

I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is very close to my last counteroffer.  While I would prefer to pay less, I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's important to balance the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and the possibility of paying a higher price from John. Given this, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
