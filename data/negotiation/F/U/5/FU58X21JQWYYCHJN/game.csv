"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $13,500 for it, which is a great value considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,500 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12,500 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $12,250. I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know what you think!",12250.0,Bob,4,
