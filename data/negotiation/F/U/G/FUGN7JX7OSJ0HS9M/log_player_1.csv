Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a significant profit, and it gives you room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  You're not immediately giving away your ideal price, but you're also showing flexibility.

**Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go your way.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price.  It's worth rejecting and counter-offering to see if you can reach a more agreeable price.  You can try to meet him halfway or offer a slightly lower price than your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $650,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows you to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's closer to your minimum acceptable price and you're still making a profit.  Since Bob is firm on his offer, it's likely you won't get a better deal.  It's more beneficial to accept and move on rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or selling to John for a higher price but potentially losing the opportunity to work with Bob in the future."
