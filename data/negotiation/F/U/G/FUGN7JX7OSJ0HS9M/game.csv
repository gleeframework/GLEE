"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $650,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still allows you to make a profit. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
