"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $15000 to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway and make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $10750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and come down to $11250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's make this deal happen!",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10900, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. What do you think?",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $11000 one last time, but I can't go any lower. If you're serious about buying this product, I urge you to consider my offer. This is my final compromise.",11000.0,Alice,9,
