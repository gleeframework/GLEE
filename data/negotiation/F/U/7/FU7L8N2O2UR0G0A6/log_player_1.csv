Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
