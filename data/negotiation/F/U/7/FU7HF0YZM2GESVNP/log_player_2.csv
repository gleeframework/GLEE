```"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,025,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but I need to be a bit closer to my target price to make this work.  How about $1050000?  This price is a good compromise and will allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even though it's getting closer. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not finding a better deal is increasing.  Bob's best strategy is to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, securing the deal and avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
