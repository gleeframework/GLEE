"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's also important to remember that Bob doesn't know the value of the product, so I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential lack of information.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is $1,000 above my minimum and I'm not sure we'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's always a good idea to secure a deal when it's close to what you're looking for, especially with limited rounds remaining."
