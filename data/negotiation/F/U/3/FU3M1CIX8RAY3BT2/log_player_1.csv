"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,000,000.  This gives him a good incentive to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for closer to $950,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $925,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still keeps the price higher than Bob's offer.  The goal is to find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe there's still room for improvement with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm trying to reach a compromise while still getting a price I'm happy with.  It's important to signal a willingness to meet halfway, but also show that I won't settle for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe there's still room for improvement with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm offering $875,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  This is also right in the middle of Bob's last offer and my minimum.  If Bob rejects this, I'm likely to accept John's offer in the next round, as we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We are running out of time, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I still make a profit and avoid a potential loss by continuing to negotiate."
