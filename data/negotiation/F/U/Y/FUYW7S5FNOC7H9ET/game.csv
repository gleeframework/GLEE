"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $700000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $700000 is the best price. I'm willing to pay up to $650000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $650000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its unique features and value, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $680000. It's a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth.
