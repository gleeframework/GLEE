"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something I've carefully cultivated and I know you'd make great use of it. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. John's offer of $1,200,000 sets a potential upper limit, but there's room for negotiation with Alice."
