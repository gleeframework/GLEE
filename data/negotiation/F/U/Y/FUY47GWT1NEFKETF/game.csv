"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something I've carefully cultivated and I know you'd make great use of it. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This represents a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
