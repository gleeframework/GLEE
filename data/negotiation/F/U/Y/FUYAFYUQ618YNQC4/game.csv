"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I do see the value in this product. However, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $750000? I believe this is still a fair price given my budget and the market value of similar items.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit over budget.  Could we settle at $800000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,4,
