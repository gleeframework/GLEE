# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Reason: While $900,000 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?
