"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that works for you.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. While $175 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $150 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
