"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? This allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work towards a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1025000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $975000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $975000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1000000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to go up to $987500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",987500.0,Bob,6,
