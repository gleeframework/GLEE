{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $950,000,  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1025000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm willing to offer $975000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to stick to my goal of getting at least $1,000,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $975,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to go up to $987500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500.

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better to be safe than sorry.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
