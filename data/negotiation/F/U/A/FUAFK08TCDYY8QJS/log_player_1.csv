Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Aiming high, but reasonably:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for you to profit significantly while still making it highly likely Bob will accept. This price gives Bob a $20 discount, a strong incentive to buy.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $80."
