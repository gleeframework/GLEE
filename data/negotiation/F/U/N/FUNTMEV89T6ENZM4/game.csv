"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I receive a fair return for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the significant value I'm bringing to the table, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, which would be $1275000. Can we consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I value this product highly, and I believe it's worth more than $1275000. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
