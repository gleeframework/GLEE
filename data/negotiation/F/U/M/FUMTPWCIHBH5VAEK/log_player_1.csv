Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,700,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,700,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for him to make a profit (since he values it at $800,000). It also creates a sense of urgency as he might be worried about losing out on a potentially good deal.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. It also avoids pressuring him excessively, which could make him more likely to reject the offer.

**Important Note:** This is a strategy based on limited information. A more nuanced approach would involve analyzing Bob's potential negotiating tactics, the urgency of his need for the product, and other factors."
