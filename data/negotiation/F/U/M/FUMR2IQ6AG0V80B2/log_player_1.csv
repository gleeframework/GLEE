Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how he responds!"
