"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $12000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This reflects the value I see in the product and also acknowledges your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $16000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $13500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is closer to your offer and also keeps me closer to my valuation. I'm hopeful that we can finalize a deal with this compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really think $13500 is a fair price for this product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
