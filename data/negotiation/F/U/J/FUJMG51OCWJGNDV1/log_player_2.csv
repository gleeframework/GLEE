"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm asking for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than it's worth to you, and I'll be able to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You value the product at $12,000 and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This means you'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting it for less than its worth to you. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial decision."
