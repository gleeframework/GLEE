While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,580,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still represents a profit of $380,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could make Bob less willing to compromise. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to reinvest the capital sooner rather than risking a prolonged negotiation."
