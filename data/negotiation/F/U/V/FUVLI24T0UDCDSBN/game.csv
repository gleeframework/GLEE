"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I think the product is worth more than $15,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $16,000. Let's try to find some common ground here.",16000.0,Bob,4,
