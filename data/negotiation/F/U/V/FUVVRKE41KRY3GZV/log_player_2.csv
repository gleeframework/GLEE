{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets a firm limit. It's likely she'll counter, but this gives us a starting point for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's last price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to pay significantly more than my maximum.  I'm hoping this encourages Alice to come down further in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's getting closer to my max budget, but I'm not willing to accept yet. I'm hoping that by rejecting and making another counteroffer, she'll come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but staying below Alice's current price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her asking price, but I'm still holding firm to my budget. With a few rounds remaining, I need to start getting closer to a deal, but I'm not giving up on getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are still too high for my budget, and we're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.  Rather than risk getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice, it's better to go with the guaranteed price from John."
