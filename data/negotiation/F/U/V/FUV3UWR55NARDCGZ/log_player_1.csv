Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product's key features and benefits] and I'm confident it's worth at least $8,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price range by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's a good starting point for a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within my 10 rounds and can potentially secure a higher price. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  Let's split the difference this time. Would you consider $8,000 for the product?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us having to go back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! I'm willing to meet you at $7500 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While Bob is offering $7,500, it's still below my minimum desired price. I've reached the point where it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the most sensible choice."
