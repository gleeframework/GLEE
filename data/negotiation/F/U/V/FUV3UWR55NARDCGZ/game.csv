"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. It's a [brief description of the product's key features and benefits] and I'm confident it's worth at least $8000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it's a good starting point for a deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  Let's split the difference this time. Would you consider $8000 for the product?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us having to go back and forth any further.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! I'm willing to meet you at $7500 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
