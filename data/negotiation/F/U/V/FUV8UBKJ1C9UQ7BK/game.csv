"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
