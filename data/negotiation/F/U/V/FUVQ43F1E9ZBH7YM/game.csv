"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a good price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $12250. I can meet you halfway between $12250 and my original price, which is $13500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13375. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",13375.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $12750, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12750.0,Bob,8,
