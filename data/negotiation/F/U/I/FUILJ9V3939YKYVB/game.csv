"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000 at this point. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do a bit better than my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a free warranty and support package. How about we call it $10,500 for the package deal?",10500.0,Alice,9,
