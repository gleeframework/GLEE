"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the potential value he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, making it clear I'm open to discussion. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a starting point that's still favorable to me. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While his offer is closer to my price than the previous round, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, so I don't need to rush into accepting a low offer.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still within a range that is likely to be appealing to Bob. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but still maintaining a significant margin.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Direct Approach:** I'm asking for a clear answer to gauge his interest and potentially reach a deal in this round.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a more concrete step towards a potential deal, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation if needed. My goal is to get Bob closer to my desired price point. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his reaction and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I can do $9500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** While we're getting closer, there's not much room for further negotiation without significantly impacting my profit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John remains a viable option, giving me the leverage to push for a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to my target.  If Bob's offers remain too low, I'll likely sell to John in the later rounds to ensure a satisfactory return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9,500 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I've lowered my price again, showing a willingness to compromise, but not too far.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my target price while signaling that further concessions are unlikely. I'm hoping to reach a deal in this round, but if Bob rejects, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be even more aggressive on the price. I can do $9200, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** We are running out of rounds, and there's little room for significant negotiation at this point.
* **Guaranteed Return:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a substantial profit and avoids further risk of a lower offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

Given the dwindling rounds and the low offers from Bob, I've decided to sell to John. This ensures a profitable outcome and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
