"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I can do $9500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $9500 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $10000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
