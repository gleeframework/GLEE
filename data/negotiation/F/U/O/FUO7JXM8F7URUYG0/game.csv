"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $90. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $87? It's a compromise that allows both of us to reach a deal.",87.0,Bob,6,
