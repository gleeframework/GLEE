"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?  This price reflects the unique value and potential of this product.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still committed to the product's value, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
