"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain my pricing strategy to ensure sustainability.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $175 is closer, I'm still aiming for $150.  Perhaps we could meet in the middle at $162.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",162.5,Bob,4,
