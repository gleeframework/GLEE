"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe this product has the potential to greatly benefit your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but it's a bit more in line with your budget. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit outside my price range.  I'm confident that $1500000 is a fair price that accurately reflects the product's value. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1550000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. My final offer is $1500000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and it reflects the value I believe the product holds. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another option.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting into a game of chicken. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need you to meet me at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1525000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
