``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I've chosen $15,000 because it's a reasonable price that leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value ($12,000), but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is a little too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise that meets me halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. It still allows me to make a decent profit, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good deal and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, $12,500 is still a good profit for me and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm also willing to compromise to make the deal happen."
