Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a significant compromise from my last offer. I think this price is fair, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience. I've reviewed my budget again and am willing to offer $98 for your product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a price we both agree on. I have a few more rounds left before I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $101.  This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 101}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close, but Bob's offer is still too low. With only two rounds left, I'm worried I won't be able to get a better offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm guaranteed $150, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
