"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for your product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $95 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a significant compromise from my last offer. I think this price is fair, and I hope you'll agree.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience. I've reviewed my budget again and am willing to offer $98 for your product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise for both parties.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $101.  This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it carefully.",101.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal and am willing to offer $99 for your product. I believe this price is fair and within my budget.",99.0,Bob,8,
