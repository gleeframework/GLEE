**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $875,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still represents a $75,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations has no guarantee of a better outcome. Bob might not budge much higher, and there's always the risk of him walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the money sooner, allowing me to reinvest it or utilize it for other opportunities. 

Ultimately, $875,000 is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
