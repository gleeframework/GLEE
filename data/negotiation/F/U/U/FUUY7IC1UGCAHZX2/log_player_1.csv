``` 

This offer sets a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth the same to Bob.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While $850,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, $860,000 is a good deal and very close to my initial asking price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
