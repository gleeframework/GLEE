"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you."
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'll meet you at $12,500, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. It's the lowest I'm willing to go."
"I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"Hello Bob, I've been willing to compromise, but $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'll make one last offer: $12,500, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options."
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'll make one final offer: $12,800. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to sell the product for, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",12800.0,Alice,7,,
