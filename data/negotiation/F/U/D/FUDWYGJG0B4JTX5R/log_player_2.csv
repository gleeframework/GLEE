Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'll make one final offer: $12,800. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to sell the product for, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other opportunities.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice is signaling that this is her final offer and she may walk away. Accepting $12,800 is still a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price, and it avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
