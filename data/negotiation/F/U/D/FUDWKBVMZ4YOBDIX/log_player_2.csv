"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Bob has 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to stay within a specific budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price range. 
* **Further negotiation:** With 8 rounds remaining, Bob can continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He's shown a willingness to compromise, so Alice might be more open to negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step towards your asking price and represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be realistic about the product's value. Let's settle at $1,175,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  While Alice's offer is closer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price range.
* **Room for further negotiation:** With 5 rounds remaining, Bob still has time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired amount. 
* **Risk of John:** Bob should be mindful of John's offer, but there's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice before reaching his deadline."
