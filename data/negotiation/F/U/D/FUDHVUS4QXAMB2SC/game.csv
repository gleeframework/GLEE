,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
