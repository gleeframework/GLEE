"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? That would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This would give you a great deal on a product that's truly valuable, and it would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows us both to meet somewhere in the middle while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
