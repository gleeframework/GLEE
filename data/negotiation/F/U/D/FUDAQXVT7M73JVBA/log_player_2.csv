"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her value ($800,000) to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than John's offer, and closer to Bob's desired price range. Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
