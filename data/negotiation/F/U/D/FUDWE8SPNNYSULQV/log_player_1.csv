"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by rejecting Bob's counteroffer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price point.  With limited rounds remaining, it's in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid risking a lower price or having to sell to John for $8,000."
