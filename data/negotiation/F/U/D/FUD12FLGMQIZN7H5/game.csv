"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position Alice, and I'm still very interested in reaching a deal. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
