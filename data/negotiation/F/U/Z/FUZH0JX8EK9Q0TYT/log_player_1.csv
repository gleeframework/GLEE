Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation, potentially allowing you to reach a price closer to Bob's value.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above John's price, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still above Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation. While I could try to squeeze a little more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
