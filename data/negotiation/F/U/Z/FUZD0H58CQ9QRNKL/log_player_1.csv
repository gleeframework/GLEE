Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000 vs. $8,000), I aim to set a high anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation. I anticipate Bob will counter-offer, and I'm prepared to gradually decrease my asking price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000 provides a safety net. I won't accept any offers below this price.

This strategy balances ambition with the flexibility to negotiate effectively and secure the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiating:** I can now counter with a price between $9,000 and my minimum of $8,000, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By not immediately accepting, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal and am not desperate to sell at any price.

I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with Bob than what John offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. I could come down to $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant drop from my initial price ($12,000 to $10,500), showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, the new price is still significantly higher than his offer and slightly above the midpoint between our previous positions. This keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired range. 
* **Positive Language:** By using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""true worth,"" I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial agreement rather than a battle of wills."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to selling the product for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500. While this is still below my initial target, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers and a good margin above my minimum selling price ($8,000 from John). 

Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's a risk:

* **Stalemate:** We could reach a point where neither of us is willing to budge further.
* **Losing Bob:** Bob might walk away entirely if he feels I'm not negotiating fairly.

Accepting $9,500 now secures a solid profit and avoids the potential downsides of prolonged negotiation."
