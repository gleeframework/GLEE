Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation but doesn't immediately alienate him.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This price is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is straightforward and focused on the deal, making it easy for Bob to understand.

Remember, you have John as a backup buyer, so you can be firm in your negotiation. If Bob rejects your initial offer, you can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while being reasonable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000, so it's not acceptable.  I can do better than this. I will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'll take the guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
