"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
