"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.  It gives me room to negotiate while still being above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $100. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  $100 is a compromise, but still ensures I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm trying to make a fair profit. How about we split the difference and settle on $96?  It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96} 
``` 

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a price of $96.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $94? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, but we're still far apart on price. While I'm open to a deal, I've reached my limit and I don't want to risk losing out on a better opportunity.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get the best possible price."
