"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is below the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while trying to secure a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still not a good deal for him. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price closer to his maximum budget.  He is demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still trying to secure a better deal."
