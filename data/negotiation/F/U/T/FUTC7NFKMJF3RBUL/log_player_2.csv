"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
While $13,000 is less than your maximum price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for negotiation.  You can always buy from John for $15,000 if needed."
