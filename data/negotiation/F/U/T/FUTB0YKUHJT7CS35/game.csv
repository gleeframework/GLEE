"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the potential profit you'll still make.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's try to find common ground and make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there. How about $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within your budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
