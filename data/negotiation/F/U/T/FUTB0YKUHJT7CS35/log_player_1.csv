This offer starts at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a positive and encouraging message to hopefully get Bob engaged."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the potential profit you'll still make.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $1,500,000 unless I can't get a better offer. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,100,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
