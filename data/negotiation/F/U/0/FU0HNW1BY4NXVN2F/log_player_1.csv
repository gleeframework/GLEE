Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a good starting point:**  It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, showing you're open to a deal.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that you're willing to discuss the price further. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for Bob. By rejecting his offer, we can try to push for a higher price and potentially get closer to the $120 we initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $100 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the deal going. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  We're offering a middle ground price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the benefit:** The message emphasizes that this price is beneficial for both parties.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  The language remains positive and inviting to continue the conversation.

This approach aims to find a mutually agreeable price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
