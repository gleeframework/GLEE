"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,500,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can use the knowledge of John's price as leverage in your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair deal considering the significant value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is still within your budget and represents a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
