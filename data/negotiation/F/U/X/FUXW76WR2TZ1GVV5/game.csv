"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair deal considering the significant value this product holds.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
