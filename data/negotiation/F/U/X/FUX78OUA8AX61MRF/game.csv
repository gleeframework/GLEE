"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it provides a healthy margin for you.  Let's work together to find a solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, but I'm still open to negotiations. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's the best I can do at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
