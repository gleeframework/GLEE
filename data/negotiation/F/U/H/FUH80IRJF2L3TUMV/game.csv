"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this time.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but I'm on a tight budget. Could we agree on $975,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product to you for $1,037,500. This is my final compromise on the price.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is pushing my limit, but I'm willing to go up to $1,006,250.  This is my final offer.",1006250.0,Bob,6,
