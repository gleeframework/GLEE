"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go lower than $9,250.  This is a significant compromise on my end.  Consider this my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",9250.0,Alice,5,
