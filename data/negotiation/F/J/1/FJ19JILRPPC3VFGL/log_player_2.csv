"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above Bob's target. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go lower than $9,250.  This is a significant compromise on my end.  Consider this my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $9,250 is her final offer.  While this is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000, it's still above his budget.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk losing the product entirely, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget."
