"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Could we do $950,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's aim for $1,050,000. I'm confident we can get there, and I'm willing to make a final compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
