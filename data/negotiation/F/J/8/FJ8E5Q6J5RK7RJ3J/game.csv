"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a very fair price. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. My budget is firm at $800000, and I'm not able to go higher. If you're not willing to accept that, I may have to look elsewhere. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $950000, which is a significant concession from my initial ask. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
