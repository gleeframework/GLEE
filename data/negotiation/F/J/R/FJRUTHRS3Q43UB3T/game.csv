"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price well below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a significant advantage. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
