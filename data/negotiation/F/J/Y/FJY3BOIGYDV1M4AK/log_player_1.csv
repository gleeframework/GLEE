Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
