"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This represents a considerable reduction on my initial price and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value this product will bring you.",1020000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe the product has significant value. However, $1,020,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm really at my limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation. I'm willing to accept $980,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",950000.0,Bob,6,
