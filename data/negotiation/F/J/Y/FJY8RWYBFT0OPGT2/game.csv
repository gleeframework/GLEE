"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite low, but I understand you have a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is my final offer, so I hope it works for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that's your final offer, however, it's still a bit over my budget. I could meet you at $12,000. That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
