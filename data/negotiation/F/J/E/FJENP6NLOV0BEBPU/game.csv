"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a little more to $7,750. It's still a good deal for both of us, and closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",7750.0,Alice,5,
