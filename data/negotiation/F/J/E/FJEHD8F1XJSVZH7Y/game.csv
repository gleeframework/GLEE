"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",850000.0,Bob,4,
