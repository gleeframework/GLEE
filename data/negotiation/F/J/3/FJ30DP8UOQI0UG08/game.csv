"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, potentially even more than it is to me.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I could consider $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. Let's find a middle ground. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
