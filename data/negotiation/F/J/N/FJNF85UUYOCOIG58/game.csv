"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer - how about $125? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
