"Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
