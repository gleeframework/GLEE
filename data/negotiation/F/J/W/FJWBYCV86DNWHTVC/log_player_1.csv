{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profits.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your valuation at $100, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $85 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great product and I'm confident it's worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I am able to offer $90 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, $90 is a good compromise. It's better than selling to John for $80, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
