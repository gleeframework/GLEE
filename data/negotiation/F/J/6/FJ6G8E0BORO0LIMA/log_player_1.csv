"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of immense value. It's worth at least a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,500,000.  This is a fair starting point considering the potential upside. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount of money, it's far below the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $750,000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,250,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and demonstrates that Bob is serious about acquiring the product.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him with more rounds of negotiation, there's a risk he might walk away, and I'd be left with only the $1,000,000 offer from John. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing a potential buyer."
