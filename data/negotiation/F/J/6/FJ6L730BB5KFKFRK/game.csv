"Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  As a final offer, I'm willing to sell for $800,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, given the product's worth and the potential for a quick sale elsewhere.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to move on.",800000.0,Alice,5,
