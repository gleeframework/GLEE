You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price."

 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",

}
``` 

We are starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how much room for negotiation there is. This strategy aims to maximize potential savings while still showing Alice that we are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Alice came down a bit, but it's still above our ideal price. Let's continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to $800,000."

We are moving closer to our limit of $800,000 but offering a price that still allows for some potential negotiation.  We are emphasizing our target price point to guide Alice towards an acceptable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  As a final offer, I'm willing to sell for $800,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, given the product's worth and the potential for a quick sale elsewhere.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to move on.

Alice has met our target price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as both options result in the same final price."
