"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to own this product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  Could we settle on $12,500?  This would be a good middle ground for us both.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit higher than your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
