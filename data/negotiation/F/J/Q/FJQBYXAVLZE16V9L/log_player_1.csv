Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $100, offering it slightly below $120 might seem like a good deal to him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't get less than $120.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a sale."
