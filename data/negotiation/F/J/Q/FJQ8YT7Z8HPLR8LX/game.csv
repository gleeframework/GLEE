"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can offer the product to you for $115. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
