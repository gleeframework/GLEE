Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what you would get from John. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:** You are aiming for a $1,000 profit instead of the $3,000 profit from John, but you are also saving the potential risk of Bob rejecting your offer.
* **Increase the chance of Bob accepting:** While the offer is still a bit high, it is closer to Bob's value for the product, making him more likely to accept it. 

This offer is a calculated risk, balancing potential profit with the likelihood of a successful sale."
