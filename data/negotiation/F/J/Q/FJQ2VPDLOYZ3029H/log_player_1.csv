Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:
    * It's above Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him a potential profit.
    * It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so I still stand to make a profit.
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value to Bob. I'm not pressuring him but leaving the decision in his hands. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Build a Relationship:**  A friendly approach might make Bob more likely to consider a future deal.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I have room to negotiate a lower price while still making a profit."
