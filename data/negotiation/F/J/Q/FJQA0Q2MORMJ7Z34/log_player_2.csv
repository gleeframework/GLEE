You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay $120, and she is offering the product for $115. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still better off rejecting the offer and trying to get a lower price. You are only willing to pay up to $120, so this is a good opportunity to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has offered the product at your maximum price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as any further counteroffers are unlikely to result in a lower price.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum acceptable price."
