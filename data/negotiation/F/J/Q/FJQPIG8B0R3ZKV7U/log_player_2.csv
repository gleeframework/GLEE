"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's start the negotiation with a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room to negotiate further. There are still 7 rounds left, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations might lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to drop to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,250,000. Accepting this offer would result in a good deal for Bob, saving him a significant amount compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling apart is high, especially considering only 5 rounds remain. It's more prudent for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
