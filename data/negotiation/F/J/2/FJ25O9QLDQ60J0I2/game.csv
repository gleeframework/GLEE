"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum goal. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we settle at $1,175,000? It's a compromise closer to my initial offer but still considers the value of the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
