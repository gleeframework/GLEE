Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate, while still netting you a substantial profit.  This strategy allows for potential counteroffers and ensures you have a backup option with John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  You have leverage because Bob is interested and you have a backup buyer in John. By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Push for a better price:** You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, potentially getting a price closer to $1,200,000 or more.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  His willingness to make a counteroffer shows his interest in the product.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. You should aim for a price that's closer to your desired value while leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum goal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000.  
* **Fairness:**  It's a reasonable compromise that shows you are willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Still Profitable:**  $1,250,000 is still a significant profit for you and significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still some room for negotiation if Bob is serious about buying the product.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to either agree or risk losing the product to another buyer (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we settle at $1,175,000? It's a compromise closer to my initial offer but still considers the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still below your desired price range, it's very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

Here's why accepting this offer makes sense:

* **Close to Minimum:** You're only $175,000 below your ideal price, which is a small margin considering the overall value.
* **Stronger Leverage:**  By accepting this offer, you're demonstrating flexibility and commitment to a deal.  This could potentially lead to better offers in future negotiations with Bob for other products.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a significant amount of time, and you have a backup buyer in John.  

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale, secures a good profit, and leaves the door open for potential future partnerships."
