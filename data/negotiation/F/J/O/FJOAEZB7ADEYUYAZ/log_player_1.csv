{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a sense of urgency (another buyer is waiting) and positions it as a potential bargain compared to John's standing offer.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, ensuring Alice doesn't leave money on the table."
