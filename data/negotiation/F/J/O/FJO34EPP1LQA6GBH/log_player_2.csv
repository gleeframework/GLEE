"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than the $9,000 he offered.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  There are still several rounds left to find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $11,500 is still too high for Bob. He's looking to save as much money as possible, and there are still rounds left to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,250 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice is coming down in price, $11,250 is still a bit too high for Bob's budget. There are only 3 rounds left, and he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this one.  I'll offer $11,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'll throw in a small concession, and I'll sell it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice is coming down in price, $11,200 is still a bit too high for Bob's budget.  This is Alice's final offer, but Bob has one last round to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth taking that risk to potentially save even more money.  If he rejects the offer and Alice doesn't counter, he can then decide whether to accept her final offer or buy from John."
