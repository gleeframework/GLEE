It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $130 is a little high, but it's not unreasonable.  We'll see if we can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

I'm getting the feeling Alice isn't going to budge much further.  It's getting close to the price John is offering, and I don't want to risk wasting more time. I'll go with John to avoid any further haggling."
