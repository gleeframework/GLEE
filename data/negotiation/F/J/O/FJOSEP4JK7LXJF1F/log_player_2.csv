You can definitely do better than $1,000,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Let's start by offering Alice a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  $900,000 is a good starting point to see if she's willing to compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Let's keep pushing for a lower price.  $950,000 is still too high, and we have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's split the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows we are willing to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting close to our desired price. It's a good deal, and we're likely not going to get much lower. Let's accept the offer."
