Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and offering it to Bob ""before listing publicly"",  you subtly create a sense of exclusivity and potential for a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $3,000 above your minimum, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to potentially meet in the middle, still exceeding your $12,000 goal.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
