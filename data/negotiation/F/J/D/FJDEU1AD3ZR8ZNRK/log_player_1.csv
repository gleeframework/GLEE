Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price, but if you start low, you can't go back up.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
