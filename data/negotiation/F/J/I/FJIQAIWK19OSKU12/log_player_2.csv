"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $10,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), indicating there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), indicating there's room for negotiation. Keep trying to lower the price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500, Bob. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $8,000 and its value to you is $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd prefer a lower price, you've already counter-offered twice and Alice has held firm at $10,000.  This price is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000.  It's also a fair price for Alice, as it's above her product worth of $8,000."
