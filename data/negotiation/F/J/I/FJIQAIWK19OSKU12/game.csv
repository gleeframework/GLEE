"I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $10,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and a great saving for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still keen on getting this product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference at $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500, Bob. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $8,000 and its value to you is $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,5,
