"Thank you for your offer Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about this product, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm interested in getting this product, but my budget is $80. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to accept $85 for the product?",85.0,Bob,2,
