Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob. He gets the product for $400,000 less than its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
