"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the same.  My initial offer is $1500000. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's budget of $1,000,000. It's wise to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very high. I am interested in your product, but I am only willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Bob starts strong by cutting Alice's initial offer by 50%. This shows his seriousness and forces Alice to consider a more realistic price. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While $750,000 is still a hefty sum, it leaves room for compromise in the following rounds. 
* **Clear Message:** Bob's message is direct and emphasizes his interest in the product, but also his firm stance on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price that reflects the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's continue this conversation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has lowered her price, $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget and his initial counteroffer. 
* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:** There's room to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Bob still has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, making this negotiation a bit less risky.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While your offer is closer, I am still unable to meet that price. I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Bob maintains his stance with a firm offer of $1,000,000, which is his maximum limit. He frames it as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  Bob explicitly invites Alice to compromise, suggesting flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** This offer is close to John's price, putting pressure on Alice to come down or risk losing the sale.

**Strategy:**

Bob is now at his limit.  He's using John's offer as leverage, while still expressing a willingness to negotiate.  The next few rounds will be crucial to see if Alice will come down to his price."
