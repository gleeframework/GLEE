"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  Alice's starting price is quite a bit higher than our ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's significantly lower than her asking price but leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see how she responds and adjust our approach accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit higher than your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $60, as it's still below my minimum price. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign.  However, $90 is still a bit more than we'd like to spend. Let's counteroffer again, aiming to land somewhere between her current offer and our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are edging closer to our maximum budget of $80, but it's essential to give Alice the impression we are willing to walk away. This will encourage her to accept a lower offer rather than risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to our maximum budget. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance she won't go lower than $85.  It's a reasonable compromise to accept this offer, get the product, and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
