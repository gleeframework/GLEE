Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our starting point. We have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but $875,000 is still below our desired outcome. We'll counteroffer again, but we're also getting closer to considering John's offer if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm keen on reaching a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $900,000? This reflects my desire to move forward while acknowledging the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has stalled at $875,000.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk he won't move much higher. Accepting his offer secures a significant profit ($75,000 above our minimum) and avoids the potential of a failed negotiation, which would leave us with John's lower offer."
