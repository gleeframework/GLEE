"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer. He wants to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good price.  A $90 offer is a good starting point, and it's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge or that he'll run out of rounds.  Accepting the $95 offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget, minimizing the risk of losing out on a product he wants."
