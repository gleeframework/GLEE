"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer that's a bit higher than what I'm willing to accept, but still below what Bob is willing to pay.

This offer is $20 above my minimum price of $80, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is $90, which is still below my minimum price of $100, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $90, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $100.

{""product_price"": $95}

This offer is $5 above Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
