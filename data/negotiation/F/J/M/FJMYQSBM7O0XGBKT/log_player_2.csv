"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $400,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into making it available.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a final offer. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into making it available. If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John for $800,000.

While I could push further, Alice is clearly signaling she has a strong alternative with John. Accepting at $500,000 secures a significant discount from both John's price and Alice's initial offer."
