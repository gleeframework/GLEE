"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better deal than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $135 is still below Bob's maximum of $150.
* **There's not much room for further negotiation:** Bob's previous offer of $130 was rejected, and Alice has already moved halfway.  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a longer process, potentially wasting time.
* **Alice's offer is a fair compromise:** $135 represents a fair compromise between Bob's and Alice's desired prices, making it a reasonable final offer to accept."
