Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $150, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $175 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $150 if Bob refuses. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
