"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
