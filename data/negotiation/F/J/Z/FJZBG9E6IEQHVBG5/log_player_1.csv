I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering your own value for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, considering the value you place on it, I believe $1,200,000 is still a reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000.
