"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? That's my best offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,025,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to my budget, and I'm willing to make a final offer. How about $980,000? That's the maximum I can afford, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,
