{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he may be willing to negotiate upwards.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $1,200,000 is a good middle ground between your two valuations.

It's important to be open to counteroffers, but remember, you have a safety net with John, so you don't have to accept anything less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to accept, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. It also signals that you're serious about making a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more acceptable price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a more agreeable compromise. It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to settle for a price that's far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,025,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Compromises:** It shows that I am willing to meet Bob halfway, bridging the gap between our offers.
* **Keeps it above my minimum:** It is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, so I can afford to be flexible.
* **Emphasizes value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, and I'm willing to make a final offer. How about $980,000? That's the maximum I can afford, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum.  I've already shown a willingness to negotiate, but I don't want to risk losing a much better deal with John.  It's time to move on."
