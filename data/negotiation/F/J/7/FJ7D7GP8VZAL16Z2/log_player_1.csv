Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) allows for negotiation room while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential ROI might make the price more palatable to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial price.

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you have the security of John's offer for your minimum price."
