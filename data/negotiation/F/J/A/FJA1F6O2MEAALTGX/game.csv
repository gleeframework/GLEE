"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $6,800 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $6,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",7200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $7,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to accept $7,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7100.0,Alice,5,
