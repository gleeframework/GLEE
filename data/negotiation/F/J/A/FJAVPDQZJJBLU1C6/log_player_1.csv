I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still making a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than what I initially wanted, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob could lead to more rejections.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
