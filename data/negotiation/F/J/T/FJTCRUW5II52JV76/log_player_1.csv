Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $800,000, so $950,000 gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so this offer gives you some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, leaving room for back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important Note:** Remember, the negotiation process is dynamic. If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer and your own risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I have other options. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, even though it's a good offer for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing Bob altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer closes the gap between our initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum value. 
* **Fairness:** $900,000 is a price that acknowledges the value of the product to Bob while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair deal for both of us,"" creating a collaborative and less adversarial tone.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John or making a final concession, depending on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I have other options. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $875,000 is closer to my minimum value than Bob's previous offer, it's still a significant distance from my desired outcome. 
* **Risk of going lower:** Further negotiation with Bob could potentially result in a final price that's even lower. There's a risk that I might end up settling for a price that's less than what I'd get from John.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Time is money. Continuing negotiations could take valuable time, and I'm already receiving a good offer from John.

**Conclusion:**

To maximize my profit and minimize my risk, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
