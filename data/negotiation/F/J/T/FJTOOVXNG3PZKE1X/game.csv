"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's the best I can do.",950000.0,Bob,4,
