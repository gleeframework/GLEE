Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above My Minimum:**  It's crucial to stay above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to ensure a profitable sale. 

By offering the product at $11,500, I am aiming for a win-win situation where I secure a significant profit, and Bob gets a product he values at a price slightly below his perceived worth."
