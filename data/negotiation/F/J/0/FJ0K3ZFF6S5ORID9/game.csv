"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you could be much higher.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $9000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find the product's benefits will far outweigh the extra $500.",9000.0,Alice,3,
