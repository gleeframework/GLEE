"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  I believe this price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",8250.0,Bob,4,
