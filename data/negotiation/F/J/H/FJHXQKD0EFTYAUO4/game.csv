"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it, considering its worth to me is $10000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11000 to $10500. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you at the price I originally wanted to pay, which is $10000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
