Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I am willing to negotiate but also have a strong idea of the product's worth.  

This strategy allows for:

* **Potential for a good profit:** $1,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, and a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  I can negotiate down if Bob counter-offers, while still having the option to go to John for my minimum price. 
* **Clear communication:** The message is friendly but direct, setting the stage for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to make. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. This will signal I am willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would give you a great deal on the product, and would work for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is still less than my ideal price, it's a good compromise. Bob is clearly at his limit, and pushing further might risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but the risk of losing the deal with Bob, who might still come back with a better offer later, makes accepting Bob's offer a better choice at this time. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I can always try to negotiate a better deal in the future if the opportunity arises."
