"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit out of my price range right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $6,800. Let me know what you think.",6800.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,800 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy having this product. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,
