"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  $900,000 is a significant discount from your maximum, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is still a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round to see if Alice will budge further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think $825000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the price is very close to your counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation will be challenging, and there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  Accepting the offer for $815,000 saves you a substantial amount compared to buying from John and is a good compromise."
