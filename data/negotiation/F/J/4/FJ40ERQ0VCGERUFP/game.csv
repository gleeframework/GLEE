"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,150,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but we're still a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,025,000. I'm trying to find a balance between value and price, and I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
