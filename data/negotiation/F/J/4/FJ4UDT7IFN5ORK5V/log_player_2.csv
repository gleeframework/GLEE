"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $150. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also well within your budget, and a good starting point for haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $115, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a middle ground between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer. It shows that you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to the value you put on the product. I can meet you halfway at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is very close to your target price, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's a good deal to accept. It's also worth noting that if you reject this offer, you may end up paying John $150, so it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer."
