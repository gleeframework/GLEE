Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product can bring to your business.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident you'll find this price very reasonable given the potential benefits this product offers. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer. It reflects the value of this product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
