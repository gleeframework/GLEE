,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product can bring to your business.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the value I'm seeking from this product.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident you'll find this price very reasonable given the potential benefits this product offers. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in your product, while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer. It reflects the value of this product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
