Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in your product, while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.
