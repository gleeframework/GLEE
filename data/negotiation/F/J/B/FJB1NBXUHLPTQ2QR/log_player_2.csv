"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value, $12,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000."
