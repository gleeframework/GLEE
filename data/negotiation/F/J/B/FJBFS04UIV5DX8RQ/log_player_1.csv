Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned $900,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even less than what it's worth to me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Not yet time for Plan B:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good backup option, but I don't want to give up on Bob just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my preferred price, but still within a range I believe he might be willing to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but not drastically.
* **Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Clear Message:** I'm stating my counteroffer clearly and concisely, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a good amount of money.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully assess his next offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I'm determined to get closer to that number. 
* **Negotiation space:** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, indicating there's still room to find a price we both agree on.
* **Time to leverage John:**  While I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I'll use the knowledge that I have a guaranteed buyer as leverage in my next offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves some wiggle room for negotiation. I'll also use the fact that I have another buyer as leverage to potentially push Bob closer to my preferred price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $750,000, but that's still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise. It's important to remember that I also have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Leverage:** This offer shows compromise by coming down from my previous offer but emphasizes the existence of John, who's willing to pay more, as a subtle form of pressure.
* **Fairness and Finality:** The message frames the offer as a fair compromise and suggests a desire for finality, potentially prompting Bob to consider accepting.
* **Clear and Concise:** The counteroffer is clear, concise, and leaves no room for misinterpretation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price for the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his next counteroffer and weigh my options. If it's still too low, I'll sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
