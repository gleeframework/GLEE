Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $750,000, but that's still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise. It's important to remember that I also have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's aiming for a price significantly higher than what John is offering.  Further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap sufficiently. It makes more financial sense to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice accepting another buyer's offer."
