"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming for a high price.  I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to him and my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. This counteroffer should be more attractive to Bob than his initial offer, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a more favorable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is a compromise offer that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm willing to give a bit more ground to show good faith, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to Bob than this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than John's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to the $1,200,000 value, I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate at this rate. I'll sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
