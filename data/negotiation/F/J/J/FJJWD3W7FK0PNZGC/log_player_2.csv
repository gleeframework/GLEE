"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value I've invested in developing it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than her own value of $800,000, leaving substantial room for negotiation. It's also still within your budget, but not a great deal.  There's a good chance we can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can negotiate further to reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer. I'll reject this offer and try to push her down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This reflects the significant value you've placed on the product while also allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
