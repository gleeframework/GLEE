I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. Even though the offer is getting closer to what John would pay, I'm holding out for a bit more.  I have a few rounds left and I can still potentially get a better deal from Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

Reasoning:

* We've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we're getting close to his budget but haven't quite met it. 
* It's getting down to the wire, and the risk of Bob not accepting a counteroffer increases.
* Selling to John guarantees a sale and provides a decent return, even though it's not the ideal price.
* There's a strong chance that if I reject Bob's offer, he might counter with an even lower price in the next round.
*  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
