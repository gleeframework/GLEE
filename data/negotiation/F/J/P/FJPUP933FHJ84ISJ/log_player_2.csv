"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is the fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob can still buy the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $9,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower initial offer:** Bob wants to start the negotiation by proposing a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives him room to negotiate upward if needed.
* **Reasonable price:** $8,500 is still within Bob's budget and potentially a good compromise for Alice since it's closer to her value of $8,000.
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is polite and keeps the negotiation friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget:**  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $9,000 is a fair compromise for both parties.  It's better than the $10,000 price from John and closer to Alice's desired price than $8,500."
