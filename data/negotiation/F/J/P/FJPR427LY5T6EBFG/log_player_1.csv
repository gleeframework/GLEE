Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than you might realize. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm offering it to you first for $950,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows the product's value to Bob ($800,000) and her own minimum ($1,000,000). Starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to John's offer.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value to Bob and framing the price as ""fair,"" Alice aims to anchor the negotiation in a favorable position.
* **Urgency (implied):** Mentioning she's offering it to Bob ""first"" subtly implies other interested buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy attempts to maximize profit while considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
