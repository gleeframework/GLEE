"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price, and I get to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $950,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  I'm confident this is a deal that works for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
