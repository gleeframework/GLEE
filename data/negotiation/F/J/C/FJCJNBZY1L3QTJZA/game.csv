"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I understand its worth to you is $800,000, I'm confident it holds significant potential for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price. ",1200000.0,Alice,1,
