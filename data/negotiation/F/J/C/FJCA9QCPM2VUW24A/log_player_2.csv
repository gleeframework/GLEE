Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down to $13,250, which is close enough to your desired price point of $12,000 to justify accepting the offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  Accepting her offer saves you $1,750 compared to buying from John, and represents a good deal overall."
