"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than his initial offer, I'm still trying to get closer to my minimum asking price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, $108 is still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't progress further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 112}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $109 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's getting late in the negotiation process and I'm concerned we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum asking price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
