"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get the price closer to his desired range. This counteroffer is within the ""sweet spot"" where it's lower than Alice's offer but still potentially acceptable to her, given her value of $12,000.  This aggressive approach is intended to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting subsequent offers and potentially needing to buy from John increases. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
