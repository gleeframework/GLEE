"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but is still significantly less than the value to Bob. It opens the negotiation with a strong starting point, leaving room for some back and forth while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still offers you a significant value, and hopefully we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to push the price closer to my initial offer.  I want to make sure I maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet at $1,050,000. This gives us both a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still limited to $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,025,000 is still a good profit and a significant improvement over John's offer.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and there's a risk of Bob walking away. It's best to close the deal now and secure the profit."
