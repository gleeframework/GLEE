You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given its value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter Offer:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Reasoning:**  The offer of $950,000 is still above Alice's value for the product, but it allows for room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Negotiation Mindset:** By stating your willingness to find an agreement, you're setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still offers you a significant value, and hopefully we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Upward:** You've increased your offer from the previous round, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  You've proposed a price that's closer to Alice's latest offer, suggesting a compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet at $1,050,000. This gives us both a good deal, and we can finally close this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but Not There Yet:** While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,050,000 is still higher than your ideal.  There's still room to negotiate.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the bargaining process and attempt to push the price even lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings by rejecting the offer outweigh the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still limited to $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Increase:**  You're only increasing your offer by $25,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget.
* **Reiterating Fairness:** You emphasize the fairness of the offer, highlighting that both parties would benefit from the deal.
* **Closing Pressure:**  By stating ""Let's close this deal now,"" you're subtly increasing the pressure on Alice to accept, implying a potential for the deal to fall apart if she doesn't."
