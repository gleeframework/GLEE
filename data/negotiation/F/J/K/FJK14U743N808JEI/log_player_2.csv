"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is far above your maximum budget of $100. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer of $100, knowing it's likely Alice will reject it.  This establishes my budget and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I really need to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $100. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to find a deal closer to $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm also highlighting my budget constraint to encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $145, so I'm counteroffering at $132.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $132.50 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $100. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $125 would be fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. I'm also emphasizing fairness to appeal to Alice's sense of a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the last few rounds, and I'd like to make one more serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my budget, and we're approaching the final rounds. Given the risk of running out of time and the certainty of getting the product for $100 from John, I'm choosing to buy from John.  It's a better deal and eliminates any further risk of negotiation."
