"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, aiming to maximize my profit. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $14,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" for Bob to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I still have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob's willingness to pay a premium suggests a potential for compromise.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  While $12,500 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise and still a great value for you. "", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm  countering with a price that's  higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate that the price is still a ""great value"" for Bob. 
* **Compromise:** I explicitly frame my offer as a ""compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Open for Further Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,500. How about $13,000? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There are still six rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Selling to John now would guarantee a higher price, but I'm not desperate and want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price while still having the option of selling to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $13,250? This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Reasonable Profit:** I remind Bob that this price still allows me to make a ""reasonable profit.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,250. How about $12,875? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,875 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $13,062.50?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 13062.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm proposing a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers.  
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the importance of ""closing this now"" to put pressure on Bob.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate the ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, Bob may be ready to concede to avoid further back-and-forth.

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price. With only three rounds left, I need to push for a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $13,062.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $12,931.25? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,931.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,931.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the potential for further negotiation is limited.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks ending with a lower price than what John is offering.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my desired price, ensuring a substantial profit.

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of John's offer outweigh the potential gains.  I'm choosing to sell to John to secure my profit and avoid the risk of a lower price with Bob."
