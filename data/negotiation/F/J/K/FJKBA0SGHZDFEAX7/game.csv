"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  While $12,500 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise and still a great value for you. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,500. How about $13,000? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $13,250? This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,875 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about $13,062.50?  That's a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a deal. Let's close this now.",13062.5,Alice,7,
