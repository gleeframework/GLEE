Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $900,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. While $925,000 is tempting, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $925,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $940,000?
