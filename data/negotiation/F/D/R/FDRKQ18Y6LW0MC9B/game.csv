"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $925,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $940,000?  This would give you a great deal on this valuable product, and still allow me to meet my own financial goals.",940000.0,Alice,5,
