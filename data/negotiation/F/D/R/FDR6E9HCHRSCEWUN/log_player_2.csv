Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. While it's closer to my target, I'm still within my budget and can likely negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, but I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price. Let's finalize this deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is within my budget and is getting closer to my target price.

Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
