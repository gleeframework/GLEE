Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a starting point, aiming for a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $975,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping this will be close enough to his offer that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal."
