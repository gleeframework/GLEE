Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still securing you a profit above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is slightly below your guaranteed sale price, making it more appealing to Bob while still exceeding his perceived value of $100."
