"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this investment will yield substantial returns for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I believe there's room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its true worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident in the product's value on the open market."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our asking price by $200,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:**  We've reiterated the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential returns he might miss out on.
* **Confidence:** By mentioning the ""open market,"" we subtly imply that we have other options and are not desperate to close the deal at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,800,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still a significant amount less than my target price and significantly more than Bob's initial offer. Bob is clearly willing to move substantially on price, signaling there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer again before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value you see in the product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,800,000) and our previous counteroffer ($2,000,000). This signals a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** We're highlighting that this price acknowledges both parties' positions, fostering a collaborative atmosphere rather than an adversarial negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Urgency:**  We still haven't mentioned John's offer, keeping the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now getting very close to his likely maximum price. While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $1,850,000 secures a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,500,000) and avoids the potential of a stalled negotiation leading me to accept John's offer."
