"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
