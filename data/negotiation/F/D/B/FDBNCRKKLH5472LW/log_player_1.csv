Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, and is still a good deal for him if he values the product highly. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if needed."
