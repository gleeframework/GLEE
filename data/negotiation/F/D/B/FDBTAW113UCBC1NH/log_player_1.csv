**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now offering his maximum value, it's still less than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result, and we risk him lowering his offer or walking away. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the best way to maximize profit."
