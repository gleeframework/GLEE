"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to compromise. How about $900,000? That's a significant discount from my original price, and it still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
