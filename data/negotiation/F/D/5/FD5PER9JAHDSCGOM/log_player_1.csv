"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay something closer to my value, or if he's set on his $80 estimate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I have several rounds left and I'm confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving me some room for profit. This keeps the negotiation moving forward, and hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price. It's a risky move, but I'm willing to take the chance. There are still rounds left and I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to offer $100.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's latest offer, but I still have a little margin.  I want to try to close the deal, and this price might be attractive enough for Bob. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go above his $85 offer, and I'm getting impatient. It's risky, but I'm going to sell to John for $120 to secure a profit and avoid further rounds of negotiation. I've reached a point where I don't want to risk missing out on a guaranteed sale for a potentially lower price."
