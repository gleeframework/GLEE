"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the counteroffer.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? ",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is still a good compromise, and I believe the product's value is worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer.  I could do $800,000, but that's as high as I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $815,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe the product's value is worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",815000.0,Alice,7,
