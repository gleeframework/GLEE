"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate and that you value a potential partnership with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum you're willing to accept, you have room to negotiate.  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's still potential to get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and attempt to close the deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but I also need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
