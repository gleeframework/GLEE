Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting just below Bob's maximum gives him the feeling of getting a ""deal"" if he negotiates you down slightly. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product at your minimum ensures you won't be left without a sale.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going to John."
