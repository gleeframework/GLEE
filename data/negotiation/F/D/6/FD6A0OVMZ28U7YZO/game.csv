"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to my budget, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $17,000. Could you possibly reconsider and come down to a price closer to my maximum limit of $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
