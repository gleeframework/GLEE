"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can potentially save more money. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point of $100. This is the price I would pay from John, so it's the most I'm willing to offer Alice.  This sets the bar and lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is still more than I'm willing to pay. It's also only a small reduction from her initial offer, so further negotiation may not yield a better price. Since I can get the product for $100 from John, I'll stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
