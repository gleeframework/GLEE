"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a strong desire to purchase the product while making it clear that you're looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is coming down, but her price is still above your alternative option with John. You should counteroffer, pushing closer to your limit and John's price."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price, and we can close the deal today."",

``` 

This counter-offer:

* Acknowledges Alice's movement and attempts to maintain goodwill.
* Proposes a price point directly between your last offer and her current offer. 
* Creates a sense of urgency (""close the deal today"") to encourage Alice to accept."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. How about $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
