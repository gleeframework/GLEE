Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  This price sets the stage for a potential win-win situation where both of you can walk away satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $90 is still a good deal.  It's above my minimum and leaves room for profit. Selling to John for $80 would be a smaller profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point."
