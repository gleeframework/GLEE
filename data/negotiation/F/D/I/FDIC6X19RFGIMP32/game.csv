"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's work together to make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm also working to get a fair price for my product. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
