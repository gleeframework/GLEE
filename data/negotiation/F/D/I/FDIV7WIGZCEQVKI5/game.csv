"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but considering its value to you, we're open to discussing a fair price. To start, how about we aim for a price between $100 and $120? Let me know what works best for you.",110.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,2,,
