"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $140 is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Direct Approach:** A straightforward message keeps things focused.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the product's value to Bob,  which might encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for Bob to go higher. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $140, and rejecting this offer keeps me in the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John right now would give me the minimum, but I'd rather try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while also increasing the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the deal being a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Staying Firm:**  $135 is still above my minimum, but I'm not giving in to Bob's initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:**  $132.50 is very close to my initial desired price of $135.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $132.50 is a good compromise and a decent profit for me."
