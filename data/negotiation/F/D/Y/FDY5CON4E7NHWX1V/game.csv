"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market, but the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its real worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without overpaying.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  I've been giving this offer serious thought, and to be completely transparent, $2,000,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price reflects the true value and potential of this product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I still feel that $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
