"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit off on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would give you a good price and still let me get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob has increased his offer, it is still significantly lower than my desired price of $12,000. I am confident that I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob. There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to take the risk and continue the negotiations to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $11,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this is the right price for us to agree on."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11250 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $10850. This is a fair price for both of us and closer to where I can comfortably afford it. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still hopeful that I could negotiate a better price with Bob, the rounds are getting limited, and his offers are still far from my minimum acceptable price. It's better to be safe than sorry, and selling to John for $12,000 ensures I get my desired price.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and ending up with a lower price is too high."
