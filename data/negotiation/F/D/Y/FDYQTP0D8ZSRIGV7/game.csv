"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,250?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the original value of the product to me is $8,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
