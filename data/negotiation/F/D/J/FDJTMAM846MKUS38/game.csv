"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1250000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go up to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1225000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
