"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is still a bit too high, I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop to $16,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",12000.0,Bob,6,
