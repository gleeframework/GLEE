Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is still a bit too high, I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop to $16,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving upwards, he's unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is already offering.  At this stage, the difference in potential profit isn't worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, especially since he's shown a pattern of incremental increases."
