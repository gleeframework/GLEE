Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering a price too close to $150 might make Bob feel cheated or pressured, leading to a rejection. 

By starting at $130, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
