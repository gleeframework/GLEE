{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,500 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial asking price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and I'm not willing to risk getting a price lower than what John is willing to pay."
