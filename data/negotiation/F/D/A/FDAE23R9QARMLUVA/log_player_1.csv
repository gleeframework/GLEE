I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and based on my understanding of your needs, it could be a game-changer. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we discuss a price of $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't justify going as low as $1,800,000.

""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I respect your position. However, considering my financial situation, I can't agree to $1,900,000. Let's try $1,750,000. It's still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We are still significantly above John's offer.  I'm willing to hold out for a better price from Bob for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,825,000?  This allows us both to benefit from the deal."",
""product_price"": 1825000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your efforts. I've considered your proposal carefully, but I must respectfully decline at $1,825,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,775,000? I hope this brings us closer to a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly still very interested and negotiating, we are moving closer to John's offer, but it still makes sense to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close the gap.  Would you consider $1,800,000?  I believe that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

We are getting close to a point where I might accept John's offer.  Putting the pressure on with a ""final offer"" might get Bob to agree or make his intentions clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've reviewed our negotiations and am willing to go up to $1,780,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

It's time to accept.  Bob is negotiating in small increments now, and we are quickly approaching John's offer.  Taking the $1,780,000 is the best move at this point."
