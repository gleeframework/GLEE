Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) making it attractive. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, there's subtle room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes."
