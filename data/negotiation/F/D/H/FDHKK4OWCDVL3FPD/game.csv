,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
