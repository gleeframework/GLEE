Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming slightly higher than the midpoint between Bob's value ($8,000) and your minimum ($15,000) provides room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher elsewhere, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have John as a backup allows you to be firm with your price. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to its perceived value."
