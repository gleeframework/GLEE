Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your own valuation ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Margin:** Offering it at $950,000 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" while still netting you significantly more than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product's value and encourages Bob to accept the offer without seeming too aggressive. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale without having to resort to John's offer."
