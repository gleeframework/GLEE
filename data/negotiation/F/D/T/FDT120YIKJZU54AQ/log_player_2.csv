"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still staying within Bob's budget. It demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to secure a more favorable price. The message is polite and respectful, creating a positive tone for continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. Could you meet me halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving money and moving forward with the purchase. Further negotiation could potentially get the price down, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high, especially considering the limited time and other available options."
