"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us. This product offers you significant potential gains, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,150,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Your goal is to save money**, so accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
