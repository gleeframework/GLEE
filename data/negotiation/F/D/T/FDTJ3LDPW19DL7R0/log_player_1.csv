"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a high price, acknowledging the product's value to me, but leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm moving slightly down from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a compromise that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a couple more rounds, hoping to get a better deal.  I want to avoid selling to John unless it's absolutely necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on my desired price.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If not, I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm hoping to squeeze out a little more from Bob.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm  coming down to $10,000.  I'm feeling the pressure, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is getting too close to my minimum value and I'm running out of time.  I've made significant concessions, but Bob isn't budging.  To avoid losing too much money, it's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
