"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a lower price point.  I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $700,000.  It's a fair offer that saves us both time and keeps us moving.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close this deal today.  How about we settle at $710,000?  That's a fair compromise and gets this done.",710000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price for my product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $720,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,7,
