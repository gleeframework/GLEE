Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's clear Alice is not going to budge much below $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and get the guaranteed deal from John."
