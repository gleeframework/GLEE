"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, so if you're interested, let me know quickly.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
