"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though it's not essential to reveal the actual worth to me or Bob.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Offering at $2,250,000 keeps the option of John open. If Bob rejects the offer and subsequent negotiations don't progress favorably, I can still walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to counter in the hopes of reaching a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer, and given the product's unique features and long-term value, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Holding Firm:** The new price of $2,100,000 is still significantly above both Bob's initial offer and my absolute minimum. This maintains pressure while aiming for a more mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's ""unique features"" and ""long-term value"" to subtly reinforce its worth and justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant gain from his initial offer. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob may reduce his offer or that the negotiation could stall. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether."
