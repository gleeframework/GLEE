"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get the best price. My counteroffer is $1,180,000.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
