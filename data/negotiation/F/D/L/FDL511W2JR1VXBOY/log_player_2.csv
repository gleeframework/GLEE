Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,100,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get the best price. My counteroffer is $1,180,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but she's still above it.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation as there's a chance Alice might not budge further and Bob might end up paying more than John's price. Buying from John guarantees the product for $1,200,000, which is within Bob's budget."
