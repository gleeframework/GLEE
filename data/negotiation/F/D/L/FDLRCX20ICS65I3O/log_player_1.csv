"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the value the product will bring to Bob's business, subtly emphasizing the potential benefit for him. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate for a few rounds if necessary. My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. If negotiations stall or Bob doesn't come close enough to my price, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Having the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, but still slightly above his offer. I'm aiming for a compromise that allows me to maximize my profit while still potentially closing the deal with Bob.  I'll continue to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his responses."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing the win-win:** I'm reiterating that this is a good deal for both of us, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob while also making sure I'm getting a fair price.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further discussion and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared for further rounds of negotiation.  I'm aiming to close the deal within the next few rounds while still getting a price I'm comfortable with. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll continue to adjust my offers strategically and keep the option of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $920,000 is getting closer, but it's still not at my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I've lowered my price twice already, and I believe there's still some room for Bob to come up.
* **Selling to John is an option:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to continue pushing for a better price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly below my previous one, but still above his current offer. My goal is to continue the negotiation process and see if we can find a middle ground. If Bob refuses to budge further, I will consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $935,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer, showing a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting that this is a fair price for both of us and encourages us to move forward.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution in this round. I believe that this offer is reasonable for both of us and provides a good opportunity to close the deal. However, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind, but I'm hoping to finalize a deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $915,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $915,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic and maximize my chances of getting a better deal.
* **Selling to John is a strong option:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a high profit and minimizes the risk of a lower offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counter Bob's offer, but I'll be more assertive in my negotiation. I'll make it clear that I'm unlikely to accept any offer significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'll emphasize the benefits of closing the deal with me. If Bob doesn't make a more substantial counteroffer, I will be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $915,000 is simply not enough for me to sell. It's important for me to get a fair price for this valuable asset.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, so my final offer is $925,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I hope we can close the deal now.  If you're not willing to go that high, I will have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm taking a firmer stance, stating that $915,000 is unacceptable and that I need a fair price. This shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Final offer:**  I'm labeling this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:**  I'm still offering a compromise, but this time it's closer to my desired price.
* **Alternative:** I'm explicitly stating that I will move on to other buyers if Bob doesn't meet my offer. This emphasizes the potential consequences of a rejection.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that the combination of a firm stance, a final offer, and the threat of moving on will push Bob to accept my counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal if it means getting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a price closer to my minimum acceptable price is diminishing.
* **Bob's offer is still insufficient:** $910,000 is still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a significant profit, and the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob is too high.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome.  Selling to John now secures the best possible deal for me and avoids the risk of a less desirable outcome in the remaining rounds."
