"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand the potential range of his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe there is still room for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a good middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum. However, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a lower price, and I still believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's still above my minimum and leaves room for one more negotiation round before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, but I'm still not ready to give up.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. It's a risk, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum yet.  I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can eventually find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than this yet.  I'm hoping this will be the price that convinces Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum. It's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement. With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
