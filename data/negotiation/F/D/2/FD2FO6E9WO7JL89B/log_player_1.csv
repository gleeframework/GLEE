Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you're leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (as it's less than his $100 valuation), while also maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
