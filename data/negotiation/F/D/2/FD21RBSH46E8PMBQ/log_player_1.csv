I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price that gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is too low, I can do better than that. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130.  This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while hopefully appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too low with his offers.  While $110 is better than $100, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially getting an even lower offer.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a sale and minimizes any potential losses."
