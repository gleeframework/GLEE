"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. Let's work together to make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite comfortable with that price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
