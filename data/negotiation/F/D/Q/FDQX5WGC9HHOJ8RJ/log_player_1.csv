Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating Bob:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" for him, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  This price allows me to potentially negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still earning more than my minimum desired price of $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'm ready to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and potential counteroffers. I also need to consider the possibility of going to John with the offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Accepting would leave me with a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product and a willingness to negotiate. This indicates there's room to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 would be the safest option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. It's crucial to maintain a balance between staying firm on my minimum price and remaining open to reaching an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about finding a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to emphasize the potential for a good return on his investment. 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  $11,000 is still a profitable price for me, while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Important Note:**  I'm prepared to potentially negotiate further, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'm getting close to my threshold for selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's still a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiations Stalling:** Bob has shown a stubborn unwillingness to move further, suggesting that continued negotiation might lead to a stalemate. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation could take valuable time and energy.  Selling to John guarantees a profitable outcome and avoids potential delays.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation ending in a loss or prolonged stalemate is too high.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a secure and profitable transaction."
