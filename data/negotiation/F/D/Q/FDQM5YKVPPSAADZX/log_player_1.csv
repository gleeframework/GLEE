Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $1,450,000 leaves $50,000 on the table for Bob to feel like he got a good deal while still allowing me to get a price above my minimum.
* **Creating urgency:**  I've mentioned John, a potential buyer who will pay my minimum price, subtly creating a sense of urgency for Bob. 

By starting high and creating a sense of urgency, I can try to get the best possible price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I want to sell, $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Bob's offer is a good starting point for further negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer as a backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking to get closer to $1,400,000 for the product. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to the value you've identified. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $1,400,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum but lower than my original offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price still allows Bob to profit, appealing to his rational side.
* **Maintain leverage:** I reiterate that I'm willing to negotiate, but also remind Bob that I have other options if we can't agree. This helps keep the pressure on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is just $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, I can still attempt to negotiate a higher price in future rounds if I reject his offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might be left with John's offer of $1,200,000.

Considering the potential for future negotiation and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point. I can always try to negotiate a higher price later, but it's important to secure a sale."
