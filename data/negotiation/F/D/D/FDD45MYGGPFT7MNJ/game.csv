"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential benefit I see in owning this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is below my initial ask, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a good compromise.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial price. However, $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway once more and offer it for $1,087,500. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring you. Let's make this deal happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
