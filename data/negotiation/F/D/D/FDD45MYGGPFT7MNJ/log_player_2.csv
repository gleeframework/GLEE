"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential benefit I see in owning this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is below my initial ask, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a good compromise.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has come down, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **You still have room to negotiate.**  Alice is showing flexibility and you know she's willing to go lower than her initial offer.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 7 rounds remaining to try and get a better price.  By rejecting her offer, you can make a counteroffer that might be closer to your target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial price. However, $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway once more and offer it for $1,087,500. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will bring you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** It's just below your maximum limit of $1,200,000. 
* **You've made significant progress.** Alice has dropped her price considerably from her initial offer, and you've shown your commitment to negotiating fairly. 
* **The risk of losing the deal is increasing.**  While you could continue to negotiate, it's getting late in the game, and you risk Alice walking away or changing her mind.  

Accepting this offer secures the product for you at a reasonable price within your budget."
