"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You would save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though Alice says the product is worth $15,000 to you, that's her assessment, not yours.** Your maximum price is $15,000, but you're free to negotiate.
* **You don't know if Alice has another buyer lined up.** This is likely a tactic to pressure you. 
* **The goal is to save money, and Alice's offer achieves that.**"
