Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, giving you a substantial profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $50,000 of potential profit for Bob, making it likely he'll engage in a counteroffer. 
* **It shows confidence:**  A strong initial offer can set the tone for the negotiation and potentially lead to a faster deal. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is still a decent profit, it's significantly lower than the $950,000 you initially offered. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the final sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin.
* **Value-based Argument:**  Highlighting the value the product offers Bob reinforces the justification for the price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone encourages Bob to continue negotiations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $875,000 is the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for you, and it's likely the best you'll get from Bob.
