"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still a significant markup from her valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you might:

* **Encourage a counter-offer:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to make the sale.
* **Negotiate a better deal:** You have some bargaining power knowing John offers the product for $1,200,000. 

You can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations with Alice don't result in a more favorable price."
