Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000.  This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's a significant profit over my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents potential delays. Closing the deal now secures the profit.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and John's offer is always a safety net."
