{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $10,000 floor, so you're already getting a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more engaging and potentially profitable negotiation.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to compromise:** This initial offer shows Bob you're open to negotiation and not just setting a rigid price. 

Keep in mind that the negotiation can go in many directions, so be prepared to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and doesn't reflect the true value of the product. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a better price.  You can use the next round to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,200. This price still allows for both of us to get a good deal. Let's find a common ground, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200} 
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** This shows you're flexible and willing to meet halfway. 
* **It's still profitable for you:** You're still earning more than your minimum $10,000 and have a good chance of getting a deal closer to the product's true value.
* **It leaves space for further negotiation:** You can still adjust the price if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of making another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than your initial target, it's a decent compromise. You're getting $1,000 more than selling to John, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher price."
