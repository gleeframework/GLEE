"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $850,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product.  What do you think?",780000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'll meet you right at the top of your budget, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $810,000?",810000.0,Alice,5,
