"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $25000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we aim for $18000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $14000. Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $18000, which would be $16000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that offer.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I need to make a small profit. How about we do $16000, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal?",16000.0,Alice,7,
