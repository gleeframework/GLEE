Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better price. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $175 offers a reasonable markup without being excessively high. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
