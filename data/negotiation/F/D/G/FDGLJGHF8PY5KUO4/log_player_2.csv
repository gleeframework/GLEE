Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your revised offer and understand your position.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,600,000? This price recognizes the product's true value while acknowledging your investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you're serious about this purchase.  Your willingness to move up shows your commitment.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $1,400,000. She's introduced the pressure of another buyer, implying this is her best offer. Since you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, it makes no sense to pay more with Alice.  You've successfully negotiated Alice down, but your best move is to secure your ideal price with John."
