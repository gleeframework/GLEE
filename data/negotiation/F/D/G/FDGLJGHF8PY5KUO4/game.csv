"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  To move this forward, I can offer $950,000. This is a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your revised offer and understand your position.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,600,000? This price recognizes the product's true value while acknowledging your investment.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I can do $1,100,000 as my final offer. I believe this is a fair and generous offer considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate that you're serious about this purchase.  Your willingness to move up shows your commitment.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
