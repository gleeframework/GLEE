"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a good profit while also giving Bob some incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $13,500 for the product. That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit ($750 above my minimum).  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale and ending up with only John's offer of $12,000.  It's important to balance the potential for higher profits with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
