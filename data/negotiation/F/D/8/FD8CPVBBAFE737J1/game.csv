"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Could we consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $800,000 for the product?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting close to the value you're willing to pay, Bob. I appreciate your transparency. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",920000.0,Alice,5,
