Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting close to the value you're willing to pay, Bob. I appreciate your transparency. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000. You've signaled your maximum price, and she's holding firm. It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option of buying from John at $800,000."
