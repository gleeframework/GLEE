Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have time to negotiate. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a little higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and the time constraints we're facing. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $880,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement and finalize the deal.

}

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $880,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a substantial $80,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations has risks. Bob could walk away, or our alternative buyer, John, might no longer be available. It's better to secure a good deal now."
