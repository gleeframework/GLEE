* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to pay less than $1,000,000, and her starting offer is close to that.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You know the product is worth less to Alice than her offer, so you can likely get a lower price. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** You have time to negotiate and get a better deal.  

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away, which puts pressure on her to lower the price."
