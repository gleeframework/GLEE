"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in this product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be frank, I'm a little disappointed we haven't been able to reach an agreement yet.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and the time constraints we're facing. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $880,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement and finalize the deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
