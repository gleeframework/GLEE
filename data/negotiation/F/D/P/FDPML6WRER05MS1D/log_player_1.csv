"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I have room to negotiate. I'm going to counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a little, but I'm still holding out for a higher amount than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get more with a few more rounds of negotiation. Plus, I have the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm willing to come down to my minimum price of $1,500,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping Bob will accept. If not, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I've already lowered my price as much as I'm willing to.  I'm going to sell to John. It's a guaranteed deal at my minimum price."
