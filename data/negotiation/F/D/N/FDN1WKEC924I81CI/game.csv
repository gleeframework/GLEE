"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $10000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8500 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9250 for the product. This would give you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this point. How about we settle on $9000? That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Bob,4,
