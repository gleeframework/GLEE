This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've managed to negotiate the price down significantly from her initial offer of $1,800,000.
* **Below John's Price:** You're getting the product for $1,325,000, which is a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **""Final Offer"" Risk:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer.  There's a chance if you push further, she might walk away, and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
