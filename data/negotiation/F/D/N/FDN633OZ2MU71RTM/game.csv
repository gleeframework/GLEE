"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,450,000 is still a little steep for me - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,375,000. This is my best price, but I think it's still a fair value for the product.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,375,000 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
