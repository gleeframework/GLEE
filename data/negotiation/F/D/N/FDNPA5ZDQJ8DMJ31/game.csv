"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original price of $12,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11750.0,Alice,5,
