"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your target price.  You can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $900,000."
