{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum but still high enough to leave room for negotiation. It's also a round number which makes it easier to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering your value for the product. Let me know if you're interested in continuing our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more substantial offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
