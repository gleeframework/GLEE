"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still provides a good margin for you while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding that price a little high. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This price is fair to both of us and will allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
