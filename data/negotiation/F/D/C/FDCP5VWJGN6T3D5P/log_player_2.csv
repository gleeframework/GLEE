You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $800,000 shows a strong desire to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range.  This gives Alice room to counter while potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price and within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or counter with an even higher price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a good price without risking losing the deal entirely."
