"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. I'm confident this price will be a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000.  This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you to make a profitable sale.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1,080,000, which is a reasonable discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
