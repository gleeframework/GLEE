"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. I'm confident this price will be a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save more money.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for the possibility of reaching an even lower price.  It's also worth noting that the $1,150,000 offer is only slightly lower than Bob's previous counteroffer, so it's likely Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,100,000.  This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you to make a profitable sale."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1,080,000, which is a reasonable discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $80,000 more than Bob's ideal price from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids any potential delays or complications."
