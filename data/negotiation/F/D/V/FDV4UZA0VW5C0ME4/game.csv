"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your target price is $700,000, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
