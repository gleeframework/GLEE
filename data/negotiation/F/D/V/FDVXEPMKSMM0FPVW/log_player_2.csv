"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there is still room for negotiation. Bob has a good chance of getting a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice. It's likely that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not lower the price further, and Bob could end up paying more or buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point."
