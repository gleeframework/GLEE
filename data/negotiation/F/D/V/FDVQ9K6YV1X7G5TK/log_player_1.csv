{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a great deal to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for the product, and it's fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $110 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still within my minimum acceptable range. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
