It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $12,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000. You should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

I'm offering Alice the minimum price I'm willing to pay, which is the same price John is offering. This is my best offer, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer."

I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, as I'm saving money compared to Alice's offer and Alice is getting a higher price than from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer is now lower than $9,000, which is closer to my limit of $8,000. It's worth accepting this offer as it saves me $500 compared to buying from John."
