Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it slightly below $12,000 might entice him while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This gives her leverage to aim high with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price enticing enough for Bob while maximizing Alice's potential profit."
