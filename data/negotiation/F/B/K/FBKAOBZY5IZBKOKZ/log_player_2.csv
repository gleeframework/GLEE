"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a great deal for Bob, but he can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product for me. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $600,000.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $550,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially do better. Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $525,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell and me to secure the product at a reasonable price.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 525000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $525,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $575,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has reached a reasonable price with Alice. He's managed to negotiate down to $575,000, saving him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart increases with each round. It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product."
