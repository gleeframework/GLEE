"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This allows me to consider the purchase while staying within my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's inherent value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I must remain within my financial constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and acknowledges the product's worth, while still aligning with my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
