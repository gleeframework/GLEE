"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a significant price reduction. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm prepared to accept $1500000.  This would give you a good deal, and allow me to continue with my own business plans. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  Let's keep talking.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1400000. This would give you a good deal, and get me closer to my minimum. Let's close this deal now.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your number, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise again. How about $1350000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and let's finalize this transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic. I've come down from my original price, and you've shown you're interested. I'm not willing to go lower than $1400000. This is a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you. Let's close this deal and move on.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
