"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a significant price reduction. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I'm not comfortable with his initial offer, it's encouraging that he's interested in the product. I'll need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm prepared to accept $1,500,000.  This would give you a good deal, and allow me to continue with my own business plans. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  Let's keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $1,300,000 is still not ideal.  I'm not ready to sell at that price yet, and I believe I can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,400,000. This would give you a good deal, and get me closer to my minimum. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your number, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise again. How about $1350000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and let's finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is getting close, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can push for a bit more. We've both compromised a lot, and I think we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I've come down from my original price, and you've shown you're interested. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,400,000. This is a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
