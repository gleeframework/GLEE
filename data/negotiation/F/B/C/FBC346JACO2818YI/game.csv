,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I could consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the movement, we are still quite far apart.  I'm serious about finding a fair deal, but $2,000,000 is still not feasible for me.  Could you consider something closer to $800,000? That would be a much more reasonable starting point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This offer takes both our positions into account.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for trying to find a middle ground, I appreciate that.  However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, anything above $900,000 is pushing it for me.  If you can get closer to that, I think we could make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this deal done. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
