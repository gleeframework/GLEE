"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable range. I could consider a price closer to $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to find a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the movement, we are still quite far apart.  I'm serious about finding a fair deal, but $2,000,000 is still not feasible for me.  Could you consider something closer to $800,000? That would be a much more reasonable starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to his actual valuation of the product. While $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a price higher than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This offer takes both our positions into account."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for trying to find a middle ground, I appreciate that.  However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. To be honest, anything above $900,000 is pushing it for me.  If you can get closer to that, I think we could make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now gone above his initial ""reasonable range"" signaling a willingness to potentially go higher. While $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale with John, there's still potential for a deal significantly better than $900,000 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one more significant move to get this deal done. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer represents a firm stance while still offering a potential compromise that's significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating it's the ""final offer,"" a sense of urgency is introduced, encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Midpoint:** This price is roughly the midpoint between the previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway."
