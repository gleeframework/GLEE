 You can do better than $100, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering is the best option."

While $95 is better than $100, you can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth trying to counteroffer again."

Alice is unwilling to come down to a price you are comfortable with, and it's getting close to the price of John's offer. It's better to cut your losses and go with John, as you can still get the product within your budget."
