"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $750,000 is the highest I can go. If you're unable to do that, I understand, but it would be great to make this deal work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",775000.0,Alice,5,
