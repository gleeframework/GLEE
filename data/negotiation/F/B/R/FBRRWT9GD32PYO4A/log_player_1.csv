Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $149 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you get close to your maximum potential profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay.  If you had more information about Bob's price sensitivity, you could adjust your strategy."
