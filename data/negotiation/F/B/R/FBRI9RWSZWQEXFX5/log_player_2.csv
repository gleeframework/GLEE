"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. You can always choose to buy from John as a backup, so there's no harm in trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move, but it's important to show Alice that you're serious about saving money.  We'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at this price. It's better to secure the product at your limit rather than risk ending up with nothing or having to pay more to John."
