Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this initial offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest but also allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to accept due to the risk of losing the deal, it's critical to remember my minimum value for the product is $1,200,000. I will counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still higher than my minimum price. I believe this price point is more reasonable and might lead to a successful negotiation."
