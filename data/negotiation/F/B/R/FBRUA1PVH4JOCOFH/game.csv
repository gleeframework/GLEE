"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price, as it's within my budget and still offers you a good profit.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows you to get a good deal. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15500.0,Alice,5,
