Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider selling your product for $950000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I have time to keep negotiating with Bob or choose to sell to John."
