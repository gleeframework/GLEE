"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider selling your product for $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950000 is simply too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm offering $1100000.  This is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  While $1050000 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm offering to drop my price to $1075000.  This is a fair compromise that I believe will work for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1075000.0,Alice,5,
