"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $100}

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a compromise between my minimum value of $120 and Bob's value of $80. This should give me a good chance of getting a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75 because it's too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $90}

I'm increasing my price by $15 from the previous offer to $90, which is still lower than my minimum value of $120. This should give me a better chance of getting a positive response from Bob."
