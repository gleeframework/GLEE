"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm still not willing to go below $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is still too low, and I'm not sure I can get him to come up to my minimum.  I don't want to risk another round with him and risk getting an even lower offer.  It's time to sell to John."
