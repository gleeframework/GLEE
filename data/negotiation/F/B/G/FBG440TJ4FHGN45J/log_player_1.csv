Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below John's offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. It creates the illusion of a deal while aiming to maximize my potential earnings."
