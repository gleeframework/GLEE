"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $12000 is a good offer, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $13500?  This would still represent a significant value for you, and it would allow me to reach a price point that works for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
