Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is a strong starting point. It's just below your guaranteed price and significantly more than Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message aims to be persuasive without being pushy. Highlighting a ""great deal"" might entice Bob to consider it. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, starting with a strong offer maximizes your potential profit while still leaving a safety net with John."
