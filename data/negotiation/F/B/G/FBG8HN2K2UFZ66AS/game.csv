"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise here. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
