"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $14,000? I'm hoping to close this deal quickly.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $15,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
