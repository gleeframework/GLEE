"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""benefits,"" I'm aiming to frame the product's value in Bob's mind beyond the $1,000,000 he currently perceives. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer in my back pocket gives me leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering the value I see in the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value and far below my minimum. While it's a substantial sum, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I still have plenty of rounds and the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and the substantial returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate. However, I'm still significantly above both his offer and my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and potential benefits for Bob's business, aiming to shift his perception of its worth.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically too quickly. I want to avoid appearing desperate and maintain a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the product's value, $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now showing a willingness to move, which is a good sign. However, $1,200,000 is still too low and significantly below my $1,500,000 safety net with John. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This offer takes into account the significant value proposition this product offers while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price range, but I'm still aiming high to maintain room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By positioning the price drop as ""meeting halfway,"" I'm reinforcing the idea of finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm continuing to highlight the product's ""value proposition"" to keep Bob focused on the potential benefits and justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the value you place on the product, $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still under my guaranteed sale price with John.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get him closer to $1,500,000 with a few more rounds.  I'm not willing to settle for less than my guaranteed offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your position. Let's bridge this final gap. I'm willing to make a significant move and agree to $1,550,000.  This final offer reflects the true value of this product while acknowledging the progress we've made in our discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a smaller price reduction to signal that I'm nearing my limit, but I'm still staying slightly above my guaranteed offer with John.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""pleasure,"" ""respect"") to maintain a good rapport and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** I'm positioning this price as a win-win, acknowledging both the product's value and the progress we've made in the negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds remaining, I'm applying subtle time pressure by presenting this as a ""final offer,"" hoping to encourage a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I acknowledge the value you see in the product,  $1,550,000 still stretches my budget. Let's finalize this deal. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the potential of the product while staying within my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's a strong price, and continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time and Certainty:** With only two rounds left, accepting this offer provides a guaranteed outcome now. Pushing Bob further might lead to him walking away, leaving me with nothing. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise and finalize a mutually beneficial agreement, potentially leading to a positive future business relationship."
