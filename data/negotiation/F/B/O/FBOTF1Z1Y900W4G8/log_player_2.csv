"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to secure a sale quickly.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000.  You can save a significant amount of money ($200,000) by going with John. 

**Important Note:** Alice's mention of another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic. Don't let it pressure you into accepting a less favorable deal."
