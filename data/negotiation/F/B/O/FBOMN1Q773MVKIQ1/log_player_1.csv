Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It also signals that I believe the product has significant value. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation. This is important for establishing a good relationship with Bob, which could be beneficial for a successful deal.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John's offer of $10,000 in mind gives me a baseline and confidence to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $14000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but there's still some room for negotiation.  
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I can get $10,000 from John gives me the confidence to push for a better price from Bob.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, hoping to reach a compromise that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 is closer, I need to consider the value of this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by reducing my price.  
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's unique value, hoping to justify my counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** $14,500 is a midway point between my initial offer and Bob's, making it a more appealing compromise.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message remains friendly and open to further discussion, which could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. Considering the uniqueness of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is only $300 below my counteroffer, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away completely. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Even if I accept this offer, I'm still getting significantly more than John's $10,000 offer, which provides a safety net.

It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks and the time investment involved in negotiation. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical decision, as it secures a good price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a loss."
