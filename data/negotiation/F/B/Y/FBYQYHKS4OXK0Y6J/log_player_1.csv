Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $130. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering the product for $130 gives Bob a $30 discount, which might be tempting, while still earning you a $30 profit over your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
