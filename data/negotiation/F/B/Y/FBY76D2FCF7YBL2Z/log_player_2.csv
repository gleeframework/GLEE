Alice's starting offer is somewhat reasonable, but there's room for negotiation. You should try to get a price closer to $100."

This counteroffer aims straight for your ideal price. It's a bold move, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115.

Alice is negotiating, but there's still room to save. Aiming for a price closer to $105 seems achievable."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. While you could try for another $5 off, it's getting risky. Accepting at $110 gets you a decent discount and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
