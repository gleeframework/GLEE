Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
