"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This price reflects both the product's worth and your appreciation for it. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's a chance you could get a better price.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a counter-offer closer to her $12,000 value."
