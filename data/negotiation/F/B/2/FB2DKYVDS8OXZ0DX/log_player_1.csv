Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, she starts high to maximize her potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding Alice's minimum.
* **Value proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing Alice's bottom line, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited information about Bob's financial situation or willingness to pay more than $12,000.  If she had additional insights, she might adjust her strategy.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice's success also depends on her ability to negotiate effectively if Bob counters her initial offer."
