,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $900000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This is my best offer for now. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  This is my final offer.  If it's acceptable, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1000000, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
