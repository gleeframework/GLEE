Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's unlikely Alice will go below $15,000.  Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's the best financial decision."
