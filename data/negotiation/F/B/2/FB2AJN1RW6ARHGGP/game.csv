"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference - $15,000 and it's yours. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
