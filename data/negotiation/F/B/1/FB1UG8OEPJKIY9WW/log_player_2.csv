"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can make a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $100 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting her offer and seeing if she's willing to lower the price."
