"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,050,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still only able to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
