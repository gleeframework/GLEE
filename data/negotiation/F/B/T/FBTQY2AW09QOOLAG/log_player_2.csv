"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's more than what she values the product at ($1,000,000). 
* This price is also within my budget, but it leaves some room for further negotiation. 
* I'm hoping this counteroffer will start the negotiation process and potentially lead to a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $880,000 is within my budget and is a better price than I could get from John. 
* While I would prefer to pay closer to my target of $800,000, accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous choice in this round.
*  There's always a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to a worse outcome in future rounds, and the potential savings may not be worth the added risk."
