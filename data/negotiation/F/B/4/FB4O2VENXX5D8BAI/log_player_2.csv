"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is closer to her own valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:

* **Starts significantly lower:** This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're aiming for a price closer to your own valuation.
* **Isn't offensively low:**  While aggressive, it's not so low that it would likely offend Alice and halt negotiations. 
* **Expresses continued interest:** The message clarifies that you are serious about purchasing the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
