Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, so there's a chance he'll reject it. 
* **It's below John's value:**  $115 is lower than John's $120 valuation, ensuring you'll still make a profit if Bob declines. 

By offering $115, you increase your chances of getting a higher price while still having a backup plan if Bob chooses not to buy."
