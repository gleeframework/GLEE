"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is too low.  My final offer is $10,500.  This is a great price for a product of this quality.",10500.0,Alice,5,
