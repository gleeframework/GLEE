Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and my other interested parties, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. He may counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and competition, making the offer seem more appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your minimum of $15,000."
