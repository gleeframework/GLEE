"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. While I'm confident I can sell this to another buyer for $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer you a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
