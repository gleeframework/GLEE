"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. While I'm confident I can sell this to another buyer for $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer you a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John and secure the best possible price."
