"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $1,150,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice wants at least $1,000,000.  There's room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum price. This allows for some room for negotiation while demonstrating your seriousness in wanting to make a deal. It also sets a clear price point for Alice to respond to, hopefully leading to a faster conclusion to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what you'd ideally like to pay. There's still room to negotiate further, and you haven't reached a price where buying from John is the better option yet. Continuing to negotiate could result in a better price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a modest increase from your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current price. It shows you're willing to compromise while maintaining a price point that's reasonable for you. This strategy can potentially push Alice closer to your desired price without risking her completely rejecting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At this price point, you're saving $120,000 compared to buying from John.  While a little more negotiation might get you closer to your ideal price, it's likely to be a small difference.  Accepting this offer maximizes your savings and secures the product."
