"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000,  which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
