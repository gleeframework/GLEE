"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what he's willing to pay for the product. There's no immediate reason to jump at the offer.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $8000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a $1000 discount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and encourages further negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise without immediately risking the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, and the offer of $8,500 represents a significant discount from her original price.  It's reasonable to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's within Bob's budget and provides a good saving compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
