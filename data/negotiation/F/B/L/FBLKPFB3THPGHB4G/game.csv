"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering it for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $11,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  That way we both get a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
