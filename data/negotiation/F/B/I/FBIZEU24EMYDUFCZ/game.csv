"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $875000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $885000. This is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree, I'll be buying from John.",885000.0,Bob,6,
