"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your ideal value. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice's offer is above her own value of $800,000. 
* **Minimizing cost:**  By rejecting and counter-offering, you have the potential to save more money than buying from John or accepting Alice's current offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a fair price for both of us and allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness in negotiation while still offering a price above Alice's perceived value.
* **Motivational message:** The message highlights the fairness and mutual benefit of the offer, potentially encouraging Alice to accept. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  This price leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects, but allows you to potentially acquire the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
