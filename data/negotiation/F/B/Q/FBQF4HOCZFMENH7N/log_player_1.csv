Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium above his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price of $1,450,000 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
