Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and positive, aiming to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the ""great deal"" to make the price more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will be enticed by the offer and accept. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or sell to John if his counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $130 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than $120.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to go down a bit to $145. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $145 is still above Bob's counteroffer, leaving room for further discussion.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll reassess the situation based on his counteroffer and whether it's closer to my minimum acceptable value or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $135. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $132 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  His message shows he's willing to pay more than $120, but I'm hoping for a better deal.
* **John's offer:** Selling to John guarantees $150, but there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to see if he's willing to budge further. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John as the negotiation is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price lower than my previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying above Bob's offer.
* **Final offer stance:**  This offer is close to my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects, I'm more likely to sell to John.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a breakdown.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to test if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John as the negotiation is getting close to my minimum acceptable value and I don't want to risk going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $135 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's latest offer is very close to my minimum, but it's not enough to justify further negotiation.  
* **John's offer:** Selling to John guarantees $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, the negotiation is getting too close to my minimum acceptable value, and I risk getting stuck with a price lower than my desired outcome.  Selling to John guarantees a satisfactory profit, and it's the best decision based on the current situation."
