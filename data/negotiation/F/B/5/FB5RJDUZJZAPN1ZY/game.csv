"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider accepting $1,000,000 for the product?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to being able to meet your number, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
