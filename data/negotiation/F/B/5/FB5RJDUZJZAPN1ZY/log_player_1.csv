"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider accepting $1,000,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, so I cannot accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to being able to meet your number, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
