This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** She's revealed that the product is worth $1,200,000 to her and is unlikely to go any lower. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** You're buying the product for $300,000 less than your maximum budget and $200,000 less than John's offer.

Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or you having to settle for a smaller discount."
