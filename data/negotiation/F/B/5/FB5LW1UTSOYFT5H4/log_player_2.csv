Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate further, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,280,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $1,280,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing the price again isn't worth it. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
