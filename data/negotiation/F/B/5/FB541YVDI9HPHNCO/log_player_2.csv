"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $200,000 by negotiating with Alice. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when the product is worth more to you than the starting offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the $950,000 price saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John."
