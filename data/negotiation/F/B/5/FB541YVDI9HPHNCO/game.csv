"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
