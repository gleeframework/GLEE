Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,050,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,200,000). Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Bob's Limit:** He's signaled this is his absolute highest price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more. 
* **Time Invested:** We've already spent several rounds.  Closing the deal now provides a good return on the time invested in negotiation."
