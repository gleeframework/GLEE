Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my ideal outcome while still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates a willingness to negotiate, but I'm setting a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, fantastic!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer. I'll consider factors like the counteroffer price, his negotiation style, and my desire to close the deal quickly versus maximizing profit. 
* I'll be ready to make counteroffers or walk away to John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe there's room for negotiation. He's clearly interested in the product, and I can try to bridge the gap. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a secure option to sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my ideal price but still reflects a willingness to compromise.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to $1,300,000 or $1,350,000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'd be happy to sell the product for $1,300,000. This gives you a fair price while still letting me get a reasonable amount.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my original offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fair Value:**  I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language and expressing enthusiasm for finding a solution. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response carefully.
* If he accepts, great!
* If he rejects, I'll weigh his counteroffer against my minimum price and my willingness to negotiate further.
* I'm prepared to make additional counteroffers or, if necessary, accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  It's a good opportunity to finalize the sale and secure a decent profit. 
* **Selling to John is redundant:**  John's offer is the same as Bob's current offer, so there's no advantage to selling to John instead.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and proceed with the transaction."
