Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:**  The offered price is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at ($80).  This might seem counterintuitive, but it ensures Alice is in a position to potentially profit even if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Below John's Offer:** Offering it for $130 is still lower than what John is willing to pay ($150), ensuring Alice gets a good deal even if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still giving the impression of a possible deal to Bob."
