Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum value but not so high that it would be immediately rejected.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still below my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $140. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is close to my desired price, and it's higher than what John is offering.  It's likely we won't get a better deal, so I'll accept this offer."
