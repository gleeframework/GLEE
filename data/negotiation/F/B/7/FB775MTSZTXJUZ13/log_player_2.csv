"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.

Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875} 
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer of $11,000 earlier in the negotiation.  It's unlikely that Alice will budge further from this price, and Bob is getting close to his maximum budget.  Considering he has only 3 rounds left, and buying from John will cost him $12,000, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a price slightly above his ideal but still within his budget."
