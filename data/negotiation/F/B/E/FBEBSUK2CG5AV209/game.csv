"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825000.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the lowest I can go. I'm still confident that this is a great deal for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at $850000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
