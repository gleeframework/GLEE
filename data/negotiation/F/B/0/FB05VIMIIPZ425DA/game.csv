"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you choose not to proceed, I have another buyer who is willing to purchase it for $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
