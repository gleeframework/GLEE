Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its value and I'm open to discussing this further if needed."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth and being ""open to discussing,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the value.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While you have a fallback option with John, Bob doesn't need to know you're willing to accept the exact same amount. This keeps your negotiating position stronger."
