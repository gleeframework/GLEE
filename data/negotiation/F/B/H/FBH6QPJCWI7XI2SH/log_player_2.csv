"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to compromise. The message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still aiming to stay under $8,500. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while remaining reasonable.  Offering $8,750 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying but is still trying to get a good deal.  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $900 above Bob's target price of $8,000. This is a good deal considering Bob has 5 rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good strategy to accept this offer, securing a decent deal and avoiding further potential risks."
