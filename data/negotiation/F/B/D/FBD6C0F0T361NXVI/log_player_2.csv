You have three options:

I'm starting the negotiation significantly lower than my maximum price to leave room for bargaining. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. Could you do $140? That's a pretty significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice is coming down, but it's still above our ideal price. Let's negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're inching closer to John's price ($120) but leaving some room for a potential final counteroffer from Alice. 
* By proposing $115, we signal that we're serious about buying but still looking for a good deal.  
* The tone remains polite and collaborative to encourage a continued negotiation."
