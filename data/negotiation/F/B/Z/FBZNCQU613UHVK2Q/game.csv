"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's get this done.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be responsible with my finances.",13500.0,Bob,6,
