"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above the product's worth to me ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Opening:** $18,000 is a significant discount from the product's value to me, but still leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer that could be beneficial for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my value. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees me $15,000, I have the opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a significant discount from my initial price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Middle Ground:**  $16,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Urgency:** I'm hinting at the possibility of selling to John to subtly pressure Bob into accepting.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's potential to secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I can afford to continue negotiating and explore a potential compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** Even though John's offer is tempting, I'd rather try to get closer to my desired price of $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as a final offer to increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm only dropping by $500 from my previous offer, showing that I'm still determined to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fair Value Emphasized:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's get this done"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $15,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be responsible with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is too low for me, and I don't see much room for further negotiation to reach a price that's both fair and acceptable to me.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob. 
* **John's offer is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob.  

While I would like to get a higher price,  the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob or not closing the deal at all outweighs the potential of squeezing out a few more dollars.  John's offer provides a secure and satisfactory outcome."
