"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant price point, but I believe it reflects the product's potential. If you're interested, please let me know and we can schedule a meeting to discuss further. If you decline, I have a guaranteed sale for $1200000 elsewhere. I'm confident this is an excellent deal, but ultimately, the decision is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
