"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  How about $140? "", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $110 is below my minimum price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to get closer to my initial target of $110? Can you meet me at $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $118 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - how about $119? That's a fair compromise and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $119. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target of $110. Can you meet me at $116? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. However,  given that I have limited rounds and John is offering my minimum price, it makes sense to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit.  It's a safe bet that Bob will likely continue to try and drive down the price, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to close the deal with him within the remaining rounds."
