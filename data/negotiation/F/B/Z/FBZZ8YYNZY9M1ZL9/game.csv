"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  How about $140? ",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try to get closer to my initial target of $110? Can you meet me at $118?,118.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $118 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - how about $119? That's a fair compromise and we can close the deal.",119.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $119. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target of $110. Can you meet me at $116?,116.0,Bob,6,
