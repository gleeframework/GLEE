Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and sets the stage for a potential deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  $175 is a good starting point to aim for a higher price, but I'm aware that I could potentially earn $150 from John if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $175, I'm allowing space for a potential counteroffer from Bob and a final price that's agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  $120 is below my floor price, making it financially unreasonable to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  John is willing to pay $150, providing me with a solid alternative if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price from $175 to $155. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone while being firm about my counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $155 is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I'm still getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed $150 from John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** $130 is still too low for me, and further negotiation might not result in a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a reliable buyer who offers a guaranteed $150, which is more than what I'm currently getting from Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob will take time and effort, and I may not get a better outcome.  

Therefore, selling the product to John is the most financially secure and time-efficient option."
