""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique item with significant value to the right buyer. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000.  This presents an opportunity to sell significantly above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above our $1,000,000 baseline.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item,"" we aim to incentivize Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
