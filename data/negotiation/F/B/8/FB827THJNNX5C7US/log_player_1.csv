Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** The $1,850,000 price point allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it implies significant value by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""exceed your expectations."" This can potentially justify the high price in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially still landing a deal above $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John, securing your minimum desired price."
