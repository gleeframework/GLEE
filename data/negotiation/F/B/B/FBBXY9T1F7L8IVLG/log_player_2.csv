"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to me is significantly higher than that. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Alice's offer:

You should reject Alice's offer again. You're still closer to your target price with John and can likely negotiate Alice down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider it. My counteroffer is $8,900 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you, as it's closer to your valuation while still reflecting the product's worth to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at $8,000 outweighs the potential savings of $100.  You're getting a good deal at $8,900, and it's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice."
