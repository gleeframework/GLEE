{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  $10,000 is higher than your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still go higher. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of a quick sale while leaving open the possibility of a higher price if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You're showing that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to negotiate further. 
* **Potentially get a better price:**  By making a counteroffer, you might be able to get closer to your desired price of $10,000. 

Selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  By making a counteroffer, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above minimum:** This offer is still significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000.

This counteroffer shows a desire to reach an agreement, while maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's a decent compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's:

* **Close to your minimum:** While you'd prefer more, it's only $250 below your minimum.
* **A decent profit:** It's a decent profit margin over your minimum, and better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Likely the best you'll get:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher offer.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision to secure a sale and get a reasonable profit without risking further negotiation."
