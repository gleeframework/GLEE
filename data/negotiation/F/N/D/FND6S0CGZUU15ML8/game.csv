"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100.  Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $110? That's a fair offer, I believe.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product for $125. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
