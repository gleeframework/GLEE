"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be of great benefit to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting this offer. You'll then buy from John if Alice doesn't come down to a more appealing price."
