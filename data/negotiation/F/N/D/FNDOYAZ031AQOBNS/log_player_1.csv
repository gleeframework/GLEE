Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits to Bob, making it clear that he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, $850,000 is still less than my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take a chance with Bob to see if I can get closer to that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller decrease:** I'm only decreasing my price by $25,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still valuing the product highly. 
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and how he'll benefit. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
