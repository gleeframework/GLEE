"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so anything less than that from Alice is a win."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's make this happen!
