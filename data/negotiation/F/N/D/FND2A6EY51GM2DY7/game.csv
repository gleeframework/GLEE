"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, I'm confident that this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,000,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for my business.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a good investment, and I believe this product truly represents that. While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the potential returns you'll see.  I can come down to $1,300,000,  which is my final offer. I believe this price point is a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,6,
