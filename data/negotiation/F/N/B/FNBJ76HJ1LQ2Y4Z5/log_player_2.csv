Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $985,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $998,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Bob should buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay, and there are only 3 rounds left.  He's already close to John's price, and there's a good chance that if he keeps negotiating with Alice, he'll end up paying more."
