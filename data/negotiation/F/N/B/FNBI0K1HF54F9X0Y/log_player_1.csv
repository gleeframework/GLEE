"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to my minimum price point. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm going to counter with $155.  This is very close to my minimum price, but I'm hoping to push for a slightly higher price.  If Bob still isn't willing to budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$140 is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit more in the next round. If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
```

I'm going to counter with $145. This is just above my minimum price, and I think it's a reasonable offer considering the back and forth. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price point. Since I have the option to sell to John for $150, I will choose to sell to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than accepting a lower offer."
