"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're willing to pay a premium, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down a little further from my previous offer. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
