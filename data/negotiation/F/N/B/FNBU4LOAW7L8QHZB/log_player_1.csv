{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want at least $1,500,000, so you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It signals a willingness to compromise:**  By offering a price lower than your minimum, you show Bob you're serious about a deal.

**Important Note:**  Keep in mind that this is just a starting point. You'll need to monitor Bob's responses and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far below what the product is worth to you. While he is willing to pay a premium, it's still not in your best interest to accept his offer. 

You have a better chance of getting closer to your desired price by:

* **Rejecting his offer** and making a counteroffer. This shows Bob you're serious about getting a better price, and it keeps the negotiation going.

You can then counter with a price higher than $900,000, but still below your desired $1,500,000.  This will continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're willing to pay a premium, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not willing to accept his low offer.
* **Is lower than your ideal price:** This shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Is a ""middle ground"" offer:**  This makes it more likely that Bob will accept. 

By making this counteroffer, you're keeping the negotiation moving forward without immediately going to John with your lower-value offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

You should reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. This will keep the negotiation open and allow you to potentially reach a more favorable price. You could consider a counteroffer closer to your desired price, but still somewhat lower, such as $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down a little further from my previous offer. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not budging significantly, but are willing to negotiate. 
* **Is still lower than your ideal price:**  This keeps the door open for further negotiation.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** You are moving towards Bob's price, but not too drastically. 

You are keeping the negotiation going, trying to get closer to your desired price without risking losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but it's time to move on. Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum:** Even though he's come up a bit, you're still losing a large amount of money compared to your desired price.
* **The negotiation is getting repetitive:** Bob keeps offering similar prices, showing a reluctance to move closer to your desired range.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John is waiting to buy the product for your minimum price.

By selling to John, you guarantee yourself a profitable sale without risking further negotiation with Bob. It's the safest and most lucrative option at this point."
