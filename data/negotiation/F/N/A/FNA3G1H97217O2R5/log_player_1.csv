Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $14,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000).  This leaves room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended.  It expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob, while also acknowledging the possibility of negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting high, I maximize my potential profit.
* I'm open to negotiation, which will help me gauge Bob's level of interest.
* I have the safety net of John's offer, so I can walk away if negotiations don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $13,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below it.**  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my $15,000 minimum.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore my options with Bob first.**

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $13,000 and $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""walk away happy."" This makes the offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm not offering my absolute bottom line yet. This allows for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to meet my price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Continue pushing for a higher price:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also being realistic and showing flexibility. 
* **Maintain a positive and collaborative tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and avoid any adversarial tension.
* **Be prepared to walk away:**  If Bob's counteroffer remains unacceptable, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
