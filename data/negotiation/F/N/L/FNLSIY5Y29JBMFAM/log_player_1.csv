Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
*  I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also considering that Bob might be willing to pay more than John, as his value for the product is unknown. 
* This approach allows for potential profit maximization while ensuring a backup option with John."
