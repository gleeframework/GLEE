"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go to make a deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to see a path forward here.  How about $1,125,000? It's a good compromise, and gets us closer to a deal. I'm confident this product is worth it to me, and I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to meet me here.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see we're getting close, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,130,000? This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1130000.0,Alice,7,
