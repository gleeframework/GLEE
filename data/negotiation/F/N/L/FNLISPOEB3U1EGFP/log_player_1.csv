"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me, and I still have a chance to negotiate further.  I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
