"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? This is my maximum budget for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it still reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's make this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11500 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. This is a fair price that's within both of our ranges.  Let's finalize this deal and move on!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $12500 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,
