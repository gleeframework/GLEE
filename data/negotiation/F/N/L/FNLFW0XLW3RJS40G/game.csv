"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which leaves a comfortable margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant amount for you and allows me to make a good profit. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
