"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for room to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits and value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message indicates that I'm open to discussion and willing to listen to Bob's counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to secure a good deal while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to meet him halfway or counter with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While $1,000,000 from John is tempting, selling to Bob at this price might be a better long-term strategy. If I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, I might be able to secure a better deal and potentially build a relationship for future transactions.

I'm going to try to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,050,000? This is still a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is in the middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  It signals a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  While lower than my initial price, this offer still allows me to make a reasonable profit and stay above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to encourage him to see the price as justified.

This strategy aims to show flexibility while staying firm on my desired profit. I'm confident that Bob is likely to see this as a fair counteroffer and potentially accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  We're getting closer, and I still believe there's room for a mutually agreeable price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm going to take the risk and see if I can push Bob to a more acceptable price. 

I'm going to make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range, and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate the price, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer and matches my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's important to push for a decision and avoid losing time.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately switch to John and sell the product for $1,000,000.  This is my final attempt to secure a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to risk losing a good deal with John by going any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds left, there isn't much time for further negotiation. 
* **Acceptable Offer from John:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees I won't lose money.
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum. Further negotiation could lead to another rejection and potentially a loss of time with no guarantee of a better deal.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000 with John rather than risk a lower offer from Bob and potentially miss out on a better deal."
