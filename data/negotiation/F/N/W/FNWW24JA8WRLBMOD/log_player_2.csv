You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a few options:

* **Negotiate further:** You can try to counteroffer with a slightly higher price, aiming for something like $1,250,000.  You might be able to get Alice to budge a little more.
* **Go with John:** Since Alice seems firm on her offer, it might be better to accept John's offer at $1,200,000.  You'll save time and frustration, though you won't get the best possible price."
