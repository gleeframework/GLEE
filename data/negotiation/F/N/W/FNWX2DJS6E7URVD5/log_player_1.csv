Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it slightly below this at $1,300,000 aims to secure the highest possible profit for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's guaranteed $800,000, providing a strong incentive for Alice to secure the deal with Bob.

This strategy balances securing a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed sale to John."
