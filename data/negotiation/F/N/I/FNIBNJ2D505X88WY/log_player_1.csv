"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to keep the conversation friendly and open to compromise.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, as he values the product higher. This will allow us to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'd be willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for better deal:** Even though Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. 
* **Time to counter:** I still have 9 rounds left, which gives me time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to compromise shows good faith and encourages further discussion. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  My counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and keeps the option of a successful deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $85 is a more reasonable price. That's the price I'd be willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and I have to consider the time constraints of the negotiation. 
* **Potential for better offer is low:** While I could try to counter, the negotiation has stalled, and Bob might not budge further.  Selling at $85 is a good outcome, considering the alternative of selling to John for $80."
