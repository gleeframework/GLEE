# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be happy to discuss a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
