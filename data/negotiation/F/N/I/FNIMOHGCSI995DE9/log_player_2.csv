"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a lower price while still staying within his budget. A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a good starting point for negotiations. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $13,500 is a reasonable compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again or going back to her initial price increases.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and significantly lower than John's price."
