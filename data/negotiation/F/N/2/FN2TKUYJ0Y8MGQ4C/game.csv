"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my minimum selling price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal.  However, $1,075,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This represents a good compromise and allows both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
