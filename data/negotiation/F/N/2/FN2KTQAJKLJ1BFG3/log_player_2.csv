"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. 
* There's a lot of room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) than Alice's asking price. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room for me to come up. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While low, my offer isn't insultingly low. It shows I'm serious but looking for a deal.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I express continued interest in the product and encourage Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate a strong return for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still allows you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down significantly from $1,200,000 to $900,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Budget:** $900,000 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to meet closer to my target price by rejecting and countering again."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial sum and reflects my serious interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by $100,000, showing I'm willing to move but not overpaying.
* **Staying Below John:** My offer remains below John's $800,000 price, preserving that option.
* **Positive Tone:** I continue to express willingness and highlight the attractiveness of my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for this valuable product. This price is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalled:** Alice has come down in price, but her offer of $850,000 is still above John's $800,000 price.
* **Risk of Overpaying:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks pushing the price higher, potentially even exceeding my $800,000 budget.
* **John's Guaranteed Deal:** Buying from John guarantees the product at my desired maximum price.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $850,000, and I'm satisfied with John's offer. It's time to secure the deal with John and avoid further negotiation."
