"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78. Let's see if we can close the deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $80. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
