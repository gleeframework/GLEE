"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $800000. I'm confident it can be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This price reflects its potential and provides some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $750000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 is a bit below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm happy to offer the product for $850000. This price still leaves some room for compromise while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $850000.
