"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential upside I see for you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the minimum of $1000000. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
