,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get an amazing deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm really struggling to go above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to make a final offer of $9500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know your final decision.",9500.0,Bob,10,
