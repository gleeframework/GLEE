"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's a fair offer considering the value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a very good price, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",875000.0,Alice,5,
