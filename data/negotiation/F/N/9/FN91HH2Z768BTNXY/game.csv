"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $8750.  This shows my commitment to buying from you, but it's the best I can offer at this point.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and come down to $8900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's find a way to make this happen!",8900.0,Alice,5,
