Alice's last offer is too high, and we're running out of time. It's best to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, as it's still within your budget. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price from Alice if you continued negotiating, there's no guarantee, and you risk going over your budget.  It's safer to secure the product from John now."
