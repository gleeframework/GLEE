"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 10 rounds, so Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  Bob should reject and continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,100,000.  I'm confident this price is fair, reflecting the product's value and allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1100000. I'm willing to make another compromise and propose a new price of $1125000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to counteroffer again and see if he can push Alice further down. There's a chance that Alice may be getting more and more eager to close the deal as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $1,125,000. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1105000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1105000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1137500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting tough. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  Bob has already made his final offer and Alice rejected it. There's a high chance Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price, especially since she's already made a significant compromise.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further price increases from Alice."
