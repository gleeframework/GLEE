"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, given the value to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the $1,200,000 that you mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $1,200,000. However, that price doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, as we are both getting closer to our desired price.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
