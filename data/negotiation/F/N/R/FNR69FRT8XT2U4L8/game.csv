"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects the significant value it holds. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
