Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's a margin for him to make a counteroffer that still benefits both of you.
* **It's a strong starting point:** It signals that you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value we initially offered.  Let's see if we can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a little lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to push for a higher price, Bob has indicated that $105 is his absolute lowest.  At this point, accepting his offer is the best strategy.  We're still earning significantly more than we would by selling to John, and we can move on to other opportunities."
