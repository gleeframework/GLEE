"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your [product name]. However, I am not able to meet the asking price of $10000. Could you consider a lower offer, perhaps around $8500? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to see if we could find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $9000. This amount aligns more closely with my budget while still allowing you to receive a fair return for your [product name]. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
