"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better than $11,000, and there's no reason to settle right away.  He should see if he can get Alice down closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he's still above his $8,000 limit. There's still time to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a good middle ground. I hope you'll consider my offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He's made good progress, and there's still room to negotiate. He should try to see if Alice will go lower with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I really appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is a very fair offer given our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer you the product for $9,800. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting close, he's still above his $8,000 limit, and he has a few rounds left to negotiate.  He can likely get Alice down to his target with one more counteroffer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,700 to close the deal.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,700 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more concession and offer you the product for $9,850. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $9,850 is tempting, it's still above his $8,000 limit, and this is his last chance to get a better deal. He's already made good progress, but with only one round left, he's unlikely to convince Alice to go lower.  John's offer of $8,000 guarantees him a good price and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice."
