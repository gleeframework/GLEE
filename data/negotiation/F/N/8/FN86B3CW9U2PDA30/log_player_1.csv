Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming high initially allows for negotiation and still secures a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob specifically, creating a sense of scarcity and urgency. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that is still very favorable for you. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of securing a much higher price than your fallback option with John."
