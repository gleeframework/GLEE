"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving your company significant resources in the long run.  I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the potential benefits and value to Bob's company, we're justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is high, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value, giving him a strong incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is strong ($1,000,000), it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000). There's a decent margin for negotiation. We're only in round 2, so it's too early to settle, especially when we have a guaranteed offer from John that's not drastically lower.  We'll aim to bring Bob closer to $1,200,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but I'm confident this product offers a significant return on investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We want to subtly remind Bob of the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Leaving Room:**  We're leaving some space for Bob to potentially counteroffer again, while staying well above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving in the right direction, but his latest offer is too large a jump down from our last counter.  It suggests he has more room to move.  While we are getting closer to John's offer, we still have rounds to spare and should try to nudge Bob up a bit more.  We will counter next round with a price closer to $1,000,000, but we'll make it clear we are nearing our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could consider $1,075,000, but I have to be realistic â€“  this is pushing my limit."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firming the Stance:**  We're signaling to Bob that we're getting close to our walk-away point. This creates a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:**  We're not just saying ""no,"" we're providing a reason (""bottom line"") without revealing our absolute minimum.
* **Compromise:**  We are moving closer to his offer, but in smaller increments, indicating this is a serious negotiation. 
* **Alternative:**  By implying we have other options, we remind Bob that he's not our only potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal.  Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a significant profit, exceeding our minimum by $175,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we *might* be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, it's unlikely to be a significant jump at this stage.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment.  The certainty of a good offer now outweighs a potentially slightly better offer later.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a chance Bob could walk away if we push too hard. $975,000 is a safe and profitable outcome."
