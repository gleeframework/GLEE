,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $100?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to go down to $95, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,6,
