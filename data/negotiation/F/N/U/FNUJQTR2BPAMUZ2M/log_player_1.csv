"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still higher than my minimum. This should give me some room to negotiate, but also hopefully entice him to accept the offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum and I can potentially get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering with $135. This is still above my minimum and gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also showing him that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still higher than my minimum price of $120, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
