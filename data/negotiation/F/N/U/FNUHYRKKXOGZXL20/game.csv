"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low.  The value of this product is well above that. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  It's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1200000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
