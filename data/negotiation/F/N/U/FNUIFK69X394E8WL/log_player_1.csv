Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is quite low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $120. It's time to cut my losses and secure a sure sale with John."
