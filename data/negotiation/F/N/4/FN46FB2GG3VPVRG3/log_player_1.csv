"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still losing $2,500 compared to my value. 
* **I have time.**  I'm only in round 2, and I can keep negotiating with Bob. There's a chance I can get a higher price.
* **John is a backup.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a quality product at a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer, but still below my minimum.**  While $13,000 is a better offer than before, it's still $2,000 less than what I'm willing to sell for. 
* **I have more room to negotiate.** We're only in round 4, and with John as a backup, I can continue to try and get a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is still the best.** It's a guaranteed $15,000, and I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob before accepting that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference?  $13,250 is a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer, but still too low.** While $12,800 is only $200 away from my minimum, I'm still losing $2,200 compared to my value. 
* **John is still a guaranteed higher profit.** Selling to John will earn me $15,000, and I'm not sure if I can get Bob up to that with only 4 rounds left.
* **I'm willing to risk it.**  I've already rejected some offers, but I believe I can still push Bob closer to my desired price. I'm willing to gamble on a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to getting this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  $13,000 is my final offer. It's a fair price, and it's a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to try to get as close as possible to my target price. How about $12900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.** We're in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. I'm not sure if I can get Bob to my target price in that time.
* **John is the safer bet.**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is closer to my value and significantly more than what Bob is currently offering.
* **The risk is too high.** While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's a good chance he'll stick to his price or even lower it. I'm not comfortable risking losing out on a better deal with John."
