"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us and I can close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $81?",81.0,Alice,5,
