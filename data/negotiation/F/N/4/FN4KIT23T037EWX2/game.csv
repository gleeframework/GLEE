"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to go with another option.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $80. I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you in the middle. How about $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,5,
