Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident it's a win-win situation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation room:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Backup plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not overly aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob as he has shown willingness to increase his offer. There's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I can accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still gain significant value from the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and that this offer still represents a good deal for him.
* **Maintain pressure:**  While I'm being reasonable, I'm not offering my minimum price yet. This keeps the pressure on Bob to potentially increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:**  Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  
* **Potential for improvement:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000,  I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I understand your financial constraints, $1,325,000 is still a little short of where I need to be. Let's try $1,340,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm framing this as a final attempt to reach an agreement. This adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Small but significant increase:** I'm only asking for a small increase ($15,000) from Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a better price.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits he'll receive. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** This could be the point where Bob is more likely to accept, as the negotiation has been going on for a while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,335,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,335,000 is just $165,000 below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **No significant room for improvement:**  Further negotiations may not yield a significantly higher price. There's a chance Bob won't budge any further.
* **Time and effort:**  The negotiation has been going on for several rounds, and the potential gain from continuing might not be worth the extra effort. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and time-efficient decision at this point."
