"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I can accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still gain significant value from the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I understand your financial constraints, $1,325,000 is still a little short of where I need to be. Let's try $1,340,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
