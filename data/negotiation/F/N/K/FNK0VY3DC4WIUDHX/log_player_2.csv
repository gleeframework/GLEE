"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  $110 is still too high for Bob, as he's only willing to spend up to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $112 is the lowest she's willing to go, and it's still within Bob's budget of $120. It's time for Bob to accept the offer and buy the product."
