"I'm surprised you're willing to go this low, Bob. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $1600000, but I need to get a bit more out of this deal. I can offer it to you for $1650000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a serious offer, and I expect a serious consideration from you.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to get as much value as possible for this product.

In exchange, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1675000. This is my final offer.",1675000.0,Alice,9,
