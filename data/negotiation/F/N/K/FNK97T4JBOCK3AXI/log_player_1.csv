{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial price is $950,000, reflecting the significant value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value I believe this product holds for your business, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I understand he's trying to get a good deal, $850,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price or find a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still firm on my belief that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and shows my willingness to work with you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make a deal and finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're at the point where Bob's price is too low and he's not budging.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of wasting more time and potentially ending up with an even worse deal.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and is a reasonable amount, given my minimum price."
