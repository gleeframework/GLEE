"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial price is $950,000, reflecting the significant value it holds for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount and leaves less room for potential savings.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John's offer as a backup provides a safety net in case negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value I believe this product holds for your business, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While she came down, $900,000 is still too much. You have a good chance to get a better price.
* **Room for negotiation:** There are still 7 rounds left, allowing for more counteroffers and potential for a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is your safety net:**  If negotiations don't work out, you can always go with John's offer for $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still firm on my belief that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and shows my willingness to work with you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but still high:**  While $875,000 is closer to your target, you can likely do better. 
* **Time is on your side:** You have five rounds left, which is enough time to potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always go with John if negotiations fall apart.

**Strategy:** 
Since Alice is showing signs of flexibility, it's worth continuing the negotiation. There's a good chance you can get the price down to your target or something very close to it."
