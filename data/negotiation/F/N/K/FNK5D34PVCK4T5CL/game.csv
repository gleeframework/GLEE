"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm still working within a tight budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $1,325,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,340,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within your budget. What do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
