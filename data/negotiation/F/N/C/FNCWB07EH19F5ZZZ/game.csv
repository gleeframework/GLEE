"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
