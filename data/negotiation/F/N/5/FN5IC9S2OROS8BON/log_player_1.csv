Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $12,000, so you're not giving it away.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to get the ball rolling and see how much Bob is willing to pay.  You can adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $7,500 is significantly lower than your minimum value of $12,000.  It's better to hold out for a better price. Selling to John guarantees your minimum value and is a safer option at this point. 

However, it's worth attempting a counteroffer to see if Bob will budge. You can use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to do $8,500.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to meet my needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good move for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's valuation:** $8,500 is still higher than what Bob considers the product worth, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It's a fair offer:** It splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.

This counteroffer aims to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway. You're now in a stronger position, as you've shown flexibility while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, so I'll offer $8,000. This is my final offer, I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $12,000.  It's better to stick to your minimum value and sell to John.

You've already made several concessions, and Bob has shown that he's unlikely to go much higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
