"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
