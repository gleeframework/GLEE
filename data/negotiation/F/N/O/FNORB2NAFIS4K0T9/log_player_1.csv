Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1000000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While it's tempting to accept the offer, it's important to remember my goal is to maximize profit. I will counter-offer to try and negotiate a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraint. While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? I believe this price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.
