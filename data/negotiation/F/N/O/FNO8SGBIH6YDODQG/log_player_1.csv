"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob (worth $12,000) and still allows me to make a decent profit. I believe it's a fair offer that's likely to be accepted by Bob without too much negotiation. 

However, I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $10,000 if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500.  I'm confident I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident that I can get a price closer to my desired profit margin. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I'm not ready to give up on getting a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $10,900. This is a smaller compromise than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting a price closer to Bob's offer. However, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it, as it's significantly better than his last offer and closer to my desired price."
