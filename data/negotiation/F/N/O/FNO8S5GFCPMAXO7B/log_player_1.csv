Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, it's always best to try and get a higher price. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Our offer needs to be significantly lower than his valuation to incentivize him to buy.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on how risk-averse you want to be as Alice."
