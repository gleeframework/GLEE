"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1500000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). This means you are getting a good deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
