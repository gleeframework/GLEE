"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, I'm hoping to get the price down to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant move, showing Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message reminds Alice that Bob is still interested and acknowledges her previous offer. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation,  allowing for a potential middle ground.  

Bob is aiming to close the deal quickly but is willing to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's halfway between Bob's offer of $12,000 and Alice's previous offer of $14,000.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to consider the time factor.  Further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Value for Bob:**  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and a good deal considering the product's value to him.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for a drawn-out negotiation."
