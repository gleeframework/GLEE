"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. It's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my initial offer of $9,500 and is well above my minimum of $8,000.  I'm confident that we've reached a fair price and it's a good time to close the deal.  It's also worth noting that we're already on round 4 and selling to John would only yield $8,000."
