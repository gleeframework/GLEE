"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is significantly below what I need, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a profit, and I would be able to afford it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm going to need to decline your offer and explore other options.  Thank you for your time and interest in the product.",0.0,Alice,5,
