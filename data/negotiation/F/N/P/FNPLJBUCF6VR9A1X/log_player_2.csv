"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a price closer to your ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $6,000, you signal that you're serious about purchasing but expect Alice to move significantly on her price. 
* **Considering Alternatives:**  You have John's offer of $8,000 in your back pocket, which provides leverage. Alice needs to offer a price attractive enough to keep you at the negotiating table."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation with her is unlikely.
* **Over Budget:** Even at $10,000, the product exceeds your $8,000 budget.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within your budget. 

It makes the most financial sense to buy from John at this point."
