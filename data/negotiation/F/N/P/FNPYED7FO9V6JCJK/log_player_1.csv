"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) and a little above what I believe the product is worth to Bob ($120).  This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport, which can be helpful in a negotiation.
* **Asking for Opinion:** This encourages Bob to engage and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $120 is the product's value to Bob, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a fair price, considering what the product is worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm  meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $155. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $155 is still a fair price considering the product's worth.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $137.50. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More room to negotiate:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I can still sell to John for $150 if this negotiation fails, so I don't need to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $137.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $146.25?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a reasonable compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 146.25} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($155) and Bob's current offer ($137.50).
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price considering the value of the product and that it's a compromise from both sides.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's truly my final offer.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  However, I have only 4 rounds left. 
* **Time Factor:**  With limited rounds remaining, there is a high chance I won't be able to negotiate a price that's above my minimum in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is above my minimum and more secure than continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I don't risk losing a profitable deal in the limited time remaining."
