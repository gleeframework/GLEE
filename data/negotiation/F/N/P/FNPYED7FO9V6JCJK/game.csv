"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, what do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a fair price, considering what the product is worth. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $137.50. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $137.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $146.25?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a reasonable compromise for both of us.",146.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's truly my final offer.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.",135.0,Bob,6,
