"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is way above his maximum budget of $120.  He should try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a fair price, considering what the product is worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price.  It's still early in the negotiation and he can likely get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $137.50. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $137.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $146.25?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $146.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $146.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is getting closer to his budget, it is still above his maximum of $120.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try to get the price lower, as he only has 5 rounds remaining."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's truly my final offer.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 135}
