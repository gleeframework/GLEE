"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105.  While that's closer to my budget,  I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  Would you consider $95?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm already making a compromise by meeting you halfway from my initial offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to hold off on other offers for now, but I need to stick to my minimum price.",110.0,Alice,5,,
