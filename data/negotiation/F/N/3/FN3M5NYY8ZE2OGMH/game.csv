"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a figure closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
