"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. This seems fair considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable middle ground considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. It's worth another round of negotiation to try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000. How about $12,200? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're already very close to John's offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation potentially failing. Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price."
