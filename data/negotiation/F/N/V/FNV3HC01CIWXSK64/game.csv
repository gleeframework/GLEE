"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. This seems fair considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable middle ground considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000. How about $12,200? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer.",12200.0,Alice,5,
