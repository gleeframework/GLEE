"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
