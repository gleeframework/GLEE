"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $850,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that slight concession isn't quite cutting it for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
