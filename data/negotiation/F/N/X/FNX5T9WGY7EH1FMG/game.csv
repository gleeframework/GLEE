"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $8,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still find this a valuable deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your willingness to negotiate. Considering my financial situation, I believe $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still find it a great value.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I believe an offer of $9,250 would be a fair compromise for both of us. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",9250.0,Bob,6,
