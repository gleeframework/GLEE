{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, and you could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This aggressive starting point will hopefully push her towards a more reasonable price, closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be more willing to compromise after rejecting my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating a deal but also that I'm not willing to go above my budget. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept a deal that's within my price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still slightly above my preferred price. I'm not confident that I can negotiate further and get a lower price from Alice. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as it's a guaranteed deal within my budget."
