This is a good starting point. It's a fair price considering the minimum you're willing to sell for is $100.  This offer gives Bob room to negotiate, which is important for keeping him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth accepting Bob's offer. You're getting $25 more than what you'd get selling to John, and you're only $5 below your initial asking price.  It's a good compromise."
