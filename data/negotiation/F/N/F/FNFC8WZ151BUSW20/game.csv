"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 as a starting point for our negotiations.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is close, but we're still a bit apart. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable asset.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant investment for me.  I hope we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
