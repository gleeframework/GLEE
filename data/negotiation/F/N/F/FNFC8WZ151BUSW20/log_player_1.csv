"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, I'm attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a high reference point for future offers.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's features, mentioning its ""unique value proposition"" hints at its worth and justifies the high initial price. 

The goal of this round is to get Bob talking and hopefully reveal more information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 as a starting point for our negotiations.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial price ($2,250,000 to $1,900,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum:** This counteroffer remains well above my absolute minimum ($1,500,000), giving me room to bargain further if needed.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point without revealing the specific details of my position. 

By making a substantial move, I hope to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a stronger offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. It's tempting to accept the $1,400,000, but I believe I can push for a slightly better deal.  I'm willing to take a calculated risk for one more round to see if I can secure a price closer to my $1,500,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is close, but we're still a bit apart. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer to encourage Bob to take it seriously. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm coming down slightly from my $1,500,000 minimum to $1,550,000 to give Bob a final incentive to close the deal. 
* **Urgency & Value:** By highlighting this as my final offer and reiterating the product's value, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and persuade Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to secure a price that works for me while still leaving Bob with a positive feeling about the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant investment for me.  I hope we can agree on this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,350,000 is his final offer. This remains significantly below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to bridge this gap. Since I have the guarantee of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most financial sense to walk away from the negotiation with Bob."
