Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I must respectfully decline at $900,000. I am aiming for a price closer to $800,000 to align better with my financial goals. Would you be willing to negotiate further?

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet a price that's significantly above John's offer. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a potentially lengthy back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed $800,000, which meets your minimum acceptable price."
