"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it would be a significant asset to you.  To start negotiations, I propose a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is still $50,000 below Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately walk away. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. We are only in Round 2, and I am confident I can convince Bob to increase his offer closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  I've done extensive research on this product and its potential, and I believe my initial offer was justified.  However, to show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $920,000. This price reflects the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 920000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Strategically:**  I am reducing my price by $30,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not drastically lowering the asking price. 
* **Justification:**  By reaffirming the product's value and my research, I am reiterating that the higher price is not arbitrary.
* **Compromise:** The message strikes a balance between firmness and a willingness to find common ground, encouraging Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to my initial offer. While $880,000 is a decent profit, I still have room to negotiate, especially with six rounds remaining. I'm aiming for at least $900,000 and believe I can achieve that with strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer ($880,000) and my previous counteroffer ($920,000), signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating this is my final compromise, I'm conveying that while I value the deal, I'm also willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Simplified Terms:**  By framing it as a ""solution"" and a ""fair compromise,"" I am aiming to shift the tone away from a back-and-forth and towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm aiming for $900,000, Bob's offer of $890,000 is very close, and it's becoming clear that this might be his limit. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit ($90,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  It's a good deal and time to close the negotiation."
