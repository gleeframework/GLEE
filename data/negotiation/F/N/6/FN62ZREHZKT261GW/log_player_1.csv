{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product and am willing to negotiate to reach a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? That way, I can still get a great deal, and you can still get a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $12,250 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it shows that Bob is serious about acquiring the product.  I'm willing to close this deal and move on."
