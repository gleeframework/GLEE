,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not getting as much as I'd like for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $92. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,7,
