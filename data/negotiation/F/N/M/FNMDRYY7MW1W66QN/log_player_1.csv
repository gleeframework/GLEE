Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $400,000 less than its worth to him.
    * I make $100,000 more than I would from John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
