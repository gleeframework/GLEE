"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's unique value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to suggest a price of $950000. I hope this is within a range that you can consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1075000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet you at a price higher than $1000000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1025000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1025000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1200000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at a price that's closer to the product's value, I think it's time to end the negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
