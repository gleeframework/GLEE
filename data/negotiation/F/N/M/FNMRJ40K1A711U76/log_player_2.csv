"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 13% discount.  This is a reasonable starting point that signals I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for potential compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is a $10 discount from her initial offer. This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not clear if I could get a significantly better deal, and there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  It's also worth noting that I have 7 rounds left, which gives me some leeway if I want to try for a lower price later on."
