"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $950,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number. To be fair to us both, I could do $725,000.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think $725,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
