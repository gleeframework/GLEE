"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, we'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly.  I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept while still being fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, and I'm already nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers, especially as I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John.  While I would prefer more, $16,500 is a decent profit and a good compromise.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
