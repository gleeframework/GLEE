Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's highly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. I'm asking for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price higher than his initial valuation.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. This means I'm not desperate and can afford to be assertive in my initial offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is risk-averse, a lower initial offer might be more effective to secure a quick sale.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'll need to be prepared to adjust my price strategically based on Bob's response."
