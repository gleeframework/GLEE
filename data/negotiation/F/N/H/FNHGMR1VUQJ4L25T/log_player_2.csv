"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than what you're willing to pay. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can leverage the option to buy from John for $10,000.  
* This might prompt Alice to make a lower offer, as she wants to sell the product. If not, you can still buy it from John and save $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
