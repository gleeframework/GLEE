"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $11500 just yet.

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm really hoping to finalize this deal. How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.",12250.0,Bob,6,
