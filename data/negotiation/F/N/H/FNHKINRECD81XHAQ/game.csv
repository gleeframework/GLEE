"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. Let's be realistic - $9,800 is still a great price for this product, but I really need to get closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to drop my price just a little more to $10,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
