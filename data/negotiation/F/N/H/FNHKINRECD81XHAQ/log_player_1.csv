Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. Let's be realistic - $9,800 is still a great price for this product, but I really need to get closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to drop my price just a little more to $10,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
