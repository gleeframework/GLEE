"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $875000. What do you think is a fair price for this product?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident that $825000 is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $837500?",837500.0,Alice,5,
