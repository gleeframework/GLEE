"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",825000.0,Alice,5,
