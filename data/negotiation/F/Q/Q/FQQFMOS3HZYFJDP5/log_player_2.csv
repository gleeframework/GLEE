"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice.  There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($150) gives you a strong negotiating position. This  shows Alice you are serious about saving money and encourages her to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price.  While $140 isn't your ideal, it's a good compromise. Accepting now prevents further negotiation and potential wasted time. You are still saving $10 compared to buying from John."
