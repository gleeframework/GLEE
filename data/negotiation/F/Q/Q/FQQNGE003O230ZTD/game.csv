"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still more than I can afford.  I'm happy to pay $90 and I believe that's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
