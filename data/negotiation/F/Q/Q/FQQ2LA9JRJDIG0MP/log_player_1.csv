"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening that gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also above my minimum value, ensuring I make a profit even if I have to accept a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'm also confident that John will be a backup buyer if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, dropping to $600,000 is a significant drop. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm still comfortable selling to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum value and closer to Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low. While I still believe I could potentially negotiate a better price, I'm running out of time. It's better to accept John's offer of $800,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value. I'm confident this is the best decision for me given the current situation."
