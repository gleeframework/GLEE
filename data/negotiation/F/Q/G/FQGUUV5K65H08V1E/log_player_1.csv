Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a compelling offer for Bob. It's a $1,000 discount from what he perceives as its value, making it a potentially irresistible deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob immediately avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer (even though John is lined up). 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while considering Bob's valuation."
