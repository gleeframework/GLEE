"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $95 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you be willing to meet me there?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $70 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $85. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about $75 and we have a deal?",75.0,Bob,6,
