"Alice, your initial offer was a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but that's my final offer. I'm sure this deal will be profitable for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price for this product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need a better price, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
