"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming low to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but firm in stating that the initial offer is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $70, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's value ($80) while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product!  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room to Negotiate:** Alice came down in price, which is a good sign. However, $85 is still closer to my maximum budget than it is to her value. 
* **Time Advantage:**  We're only in Round 3. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand $70 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $77, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's $80 value.
* **Framing:**  ""Meeting in the middle"" positions my offer as a fair solution.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I have rounds remaining, proposing a price close to a potential agreement could lead to a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to be flexible but $77 is still a bit low.  How about $82? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $82 is a solid price. It's below my maximum budget and only slightly above Alice's perceived value.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push for a small difference might not be worth the risk of losing the deal and having to go with John's $100 offer.
* **Alice's Language:** Her message suggests a strong desire to close the deal. Accepting now is likely the best way to secure this price."
