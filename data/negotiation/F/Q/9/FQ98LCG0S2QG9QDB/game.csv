"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, my initial price was based on the considerable value this product offers, which I believe justifies a higher investment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value you see in the product, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price fairly reflects the value of the product for me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close! I still believe $1,650,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. ",1500000.0,Bob,6,
