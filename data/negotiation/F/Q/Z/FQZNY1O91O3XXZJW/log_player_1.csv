{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset!"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a great deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $800,000, providing a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. 

By starting high, you increase your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value while having the security of John's offer."
