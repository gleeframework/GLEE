"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There are more rounds available, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's value for the product. It signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for potential compromise in future rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.  Bob is increasing his offer by a smaller amount this time, demonstrating a strategy of gradual negotiation. This approach might encourage Alice to accept, knowing that there are fewer rounds left and she may not get a better offer."

Round 5

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you seem very set on this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference again. How about $12,000? That's a very fair offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go higher than $11,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, the increase is small, showing that he's close to his limit. By offering $11,750, Bob is splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's offer, signaling a potential point of agreement. The message also expresses confidence that this price is fair for both parties, hoping to push Alice towards accepting."
