"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and what his initial reaction is. This gives me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $17,000, still significantly higher than Bob's offer but showing I'm willing to negotiate. This might entice him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm dropping my price to my absolute minimum of $15,000. This is a final attempt to get a deal with Bob. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to come close to my minimum, and I've already offered him my absolute bottom line. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
