"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
