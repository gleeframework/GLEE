"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere, and still leaves you a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.
