"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,000,000. It's not enough considering the value of the product. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it's unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
