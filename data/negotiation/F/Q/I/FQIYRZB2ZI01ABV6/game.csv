"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $110 is closer, I'm still hesitant. I'm happy to meet you at $105. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,
