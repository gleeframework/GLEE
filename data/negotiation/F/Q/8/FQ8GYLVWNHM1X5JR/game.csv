"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a great deal for a product worth so much.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider my other options.",115.0,Bob,4,
