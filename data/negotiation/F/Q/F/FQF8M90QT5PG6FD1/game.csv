"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your asking price and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This way we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
