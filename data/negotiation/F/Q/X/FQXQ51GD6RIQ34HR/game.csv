"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. To be frank, $850,000 is considerably below what I had in mind.  However, I'm willing to be flexible if you're serious. Could you see your way to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $950,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate that you're trying to find a compromise. Let's be completely transparent. I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000 for this product right now.  However, I believe in being fair and offering you the chance to match that price.  If you're serious, I'm willing to close the deal with you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
