"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the chance to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a deal for $887,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is closer to Bob's target of $800,000, it's still above that mark. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price. He's still got several rounds left and there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $887,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you a deal for $862,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $862,500 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  However, Bob is getting closer to his goal and with only a few rounds remaining, it makes sense to continue negotiating.  There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to drop her price further, or that Bob can counteroffer and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $862,500 is still a bit too high. I understand you have a price you need to meet, but  I'm committed to getting this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our  negotiation history.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you halfway again. I'll offer you a deal for $837,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $837,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget.  With only one round left, it's highly unlikely that Alice will drop her price to $800,000 or below.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure that Bob gets the product within his budget."
