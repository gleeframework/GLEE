"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a strong interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've already spent discussing it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting it if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're back to this price point. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the same price I offered in round 1. I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle and close the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, which is the highest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid we're at an impasse.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
