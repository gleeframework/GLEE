"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or, if necessary, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. It's worth seeing if I can nudge Bob up a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  If this offer is rejected, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is tempting and getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm concerned that if I accept now, I might be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,250.  I'm getting very close to my minimum price, and I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects this, I'll be forced to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to go any higher, and I'm running out of rounds. I'd rather sell to John and get a guaranteed $10,000 than risk getting stuck with a lower price or no sale at all."
