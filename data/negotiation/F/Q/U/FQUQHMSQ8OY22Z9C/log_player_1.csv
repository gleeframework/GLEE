Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $150 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm open to negotiation sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **No Immediate Threat:**  I don't mention John or the possibility of selling to him at this stage. This keeps Bob focused on the deal with me. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it if it's acceptable to me or counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* If negotiations stall:  I'll be ready to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is limited.  While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $135?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from $150 to $135, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the ""value"" of the product to justify my price. 
* **Fairness:** I use the word ""fair"" to subtly pressure Bob into accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Good outcome, as $135 is a better price than $120.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to decide if I want to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we possibly agree on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $130, which is only $5 less than my previous offer.  I'm willing to accept this as it's still a good profit for me and close to my initial asking price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
