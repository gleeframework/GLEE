Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with my desired price point to maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

It's important to note that while $15,000 is my ideal price, I'm aware that Bob's maximum value is $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll use John's offer as a fallback if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired $15,000 by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's.  This keeps the negotiation going and could lead to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,500 is a good starting point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is the lowest I can go. This product is truly special, and I think you'll agree it's worth the investment. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $14,000 is a compromise that bridges the gap between my initial price and Bob's offer.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to persuade him to pay a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  My message indicates flexibility and willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a final agreement. 

This counteroffer maintains my position while showing a willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a successful sale without having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $14,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate will take more time and energy.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a decent profit. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the potential risks and the time saved."
