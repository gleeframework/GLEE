"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me there. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I can offer you a final counteroffer of $10,500. It's a small increase from your maximum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
