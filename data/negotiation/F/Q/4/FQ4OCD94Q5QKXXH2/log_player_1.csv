**Reasoning:** Bob is definitely interested and getting very close to my desired price point. With still a few rounds to go, I think there's room to push him a little bit higher. It's worth risking another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,095,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has actually gone down, indicating he may be reaching his limit or employing a hardball tactic. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're running out of rounds, and accepting now guarantees a substantial profit above my minimum ($70,000 more than John's offer). It's not worth the risk of him dropping his offer further or the negotiation stalling completely."
