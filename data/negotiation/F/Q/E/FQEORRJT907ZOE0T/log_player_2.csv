"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth at least $1200000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair to both of us. Consider this:  it's a significant gain for you, and it's the best I can offer without sacrificing my own value. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, while John is asking for $1,200,000.
* **It's within Bob's budget:** The offer of $1,150,000 is below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $50,000 compared to buying from John."
