"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1,500,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $2000000 to $1750000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1500000. Can you meet me at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from his $1,500,000 offer, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation and potential dead-ends, I'll take John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's my minimum, and it guarantees a sale without any more back and forth."
