"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with another seller.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,800? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
