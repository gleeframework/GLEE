"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $775,000. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I look forward to your response.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
