"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a great deal for you, considering what you're getting.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $92.",92.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $92 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $93? That's a fair price for both of us.",93.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $90.50?",90.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92?  This would give me a little more, but also still be a good deal for you.",92.0,Alice,7,
