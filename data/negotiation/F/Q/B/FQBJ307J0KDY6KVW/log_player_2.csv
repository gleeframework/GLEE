"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $1,400,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant price. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a better deal.  Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects our mutual interests."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to show my serious intent to negotiate and get a good deal. 
* **Fair Justification:**  The message explains the rationale behind my offer, highlighting the value I see in the product.
* **Room for Compromise:** While $1,200,000 is a substantial reduction, it still leaves room for Alice to negotiate and come to an agreement within our desired price ranges."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a considerable step closer to my desired price range, making it a good deal.
* **Time Constraint:** With 10 rounds to close the deal, accepting now avoids further negotiation and potential risk of Alice getting more aggressive or the deal falling through. 
* **Better than John:**  $1,300,000 is significantly cheaper than buying from John, making this the most financially advantageous option."
