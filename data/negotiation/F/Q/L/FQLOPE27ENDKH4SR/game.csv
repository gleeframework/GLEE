"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we try $11,500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you consider $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,200? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12200.0,Alice,5,
