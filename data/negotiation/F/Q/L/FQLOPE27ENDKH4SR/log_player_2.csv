Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we try $11,500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal.

# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,200? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.

It seems unlikely Alice will come down significantly from her $12,000+ asking price.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further potentially fruitless negotiation."
