"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $9000. If you're willing to consider that, I think we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
