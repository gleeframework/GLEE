"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825,000. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin.",825000.0,Alice,5,
