,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $10000 for this product.  It's my top offer, and I'm ready to move forward if it works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $17000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
