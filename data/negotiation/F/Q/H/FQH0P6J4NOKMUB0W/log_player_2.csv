"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what I could sell it for elsewhere.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what he could get elsewhere, it still exceeds his maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John for $10,000 is the most financially advantageous decision."
