Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and I'm confident it's worth $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This allows room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $18,000, we establish a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be closer to our starting point than if we had started lower.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value to us, the message implies the product is worth a significant amount (""holds significant value""). This helps justify the high asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is. It's possible this offer will scare him away. 
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly during the negotiation process. However, always remember your minimum acceptable price and don't go below that."
