{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has only one round left, and Alice is offering a price that is still within his budget, but not ideal.

* **Accepting:**  If he accepts, he gets the product for $912,500, saving $87,500 compared to buying from John.

* **Rejecting and making a counteroffer:**  There's a risk here. Alice might reject Bob's counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John for $1,000,000.

**Since there's only one round left, the risk of rejection outweighs the potential for a lower price. Bob should accept the offer and secure the product.**"
