Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  If I reject this offer, I risk getting a lower price or no sale at all.  It's better to sell to John at $120 to guarantee a profit."
