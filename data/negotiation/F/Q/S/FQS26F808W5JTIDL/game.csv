"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're just going to keep going back and forth.  Let's meet in the middle once more. How about $109? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $108. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,8,
