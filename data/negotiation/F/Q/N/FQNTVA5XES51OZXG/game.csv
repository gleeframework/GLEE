"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
