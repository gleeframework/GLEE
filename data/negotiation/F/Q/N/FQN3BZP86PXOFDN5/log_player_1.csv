Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of significant value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to aim higher. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room to negotiate above that.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a significant markup for me but still a good deal for Bob if the product delivers the value he expects. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer isn't necessary at this stage. It might create unnecessary pressure and could backfire."
