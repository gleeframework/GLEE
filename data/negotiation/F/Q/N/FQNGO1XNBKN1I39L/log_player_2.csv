"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the potential value I see in this product for you. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth at least that to her, you have no way to verify this. It's safer to reject her offer and purchase from John, who is selling at your price point."
