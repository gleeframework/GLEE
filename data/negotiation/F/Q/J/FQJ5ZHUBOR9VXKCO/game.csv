"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to propose a price of $130.  This is still a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,2,
