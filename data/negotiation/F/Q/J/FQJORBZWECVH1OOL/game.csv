"Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $900000. This reflects a significant reduction from my original offer and demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer.  However, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our most recent offers - how about $875000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows my commitment to finding common ground.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",860000.0,Bob,6,
