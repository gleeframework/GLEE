Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below his valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (John) gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball the price. 

By pricing high but reasonably, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and us securing a higher profit."
