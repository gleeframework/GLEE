"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to sell it at a price that benefits both of us. Let's start with a fair offer of $120. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This price is fair, considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. We're willing to consider $110 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. Please let us know if this is acceptable.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little above my ideal price point. Let's split the difference and go with $105. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
