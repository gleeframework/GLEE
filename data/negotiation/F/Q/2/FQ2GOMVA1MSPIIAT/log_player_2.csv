{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly below the product's value to her ($1,200,000), and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's room to bargain."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but still below the product's value to her. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, given that Alice is motivated to sell and I have 9 rounds to reach an agreement."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to meet me halfway in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,100,000. I'm getting closer to Alice's valuation of the product, but I'm still leaving room for her to make a concession. This round is crucial, as we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. I believe a deal can be struck at this price point, and I'm hoping to avoid going to John as a last resort."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the product's value to her. We're in the later stages of the negotiation, and there are only three rounds left before I have to decide on John's offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm confident that we can close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $1,125,000.  I'm getting close to John's price, but there's still a chance to get a better deal with Alice.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. With only two rounds left, I'm aiming for a final push to secure a deal with Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal! Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I would pay John, and it's only one round before I have to make a decision.  I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Alice in the next round, so it's time to accept and secure the product."
