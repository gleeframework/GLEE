Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a price that is acceptable to both parties. It's important to keep the negotiation open while still protecting my minimum value of $1,500,000. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While $950,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Proceed to the next round:**  I believe I can still get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more than $950,000.
* **Don't sell to John yet:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I want to maximize my profit. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,100,000. It's a compromise from my initial offer of $1,200,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I emphasize the need to make a fair deal for both of us and highlight the benefit of moving forward with the negotiation. This helps keep the conversation open and positive.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while slowly working towards a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob, but I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still far from the $1,500,000 minimum I need. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Proceed to the next round:** I believe I can still get a better price. Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate, and there's still a chance we can reach an agreement closer to my desired value.
* **Don't sell to John yet:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, but I want to maximize my profit. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This would allow us both to reach a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  It's a small compromise from my previous offer of $1,100,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the need for a compromise and highlighting the benefit of a deal for both of us. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to slowly bridge the gap between our desired prices. This offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which may encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant loss compared to what John is offering. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The negotiation with Bob has reached a point where the potential for a higher price is getting increasingly unlikely. Continuing the negotiation risks a deadlock and losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a substantial profit ($1,500,000) and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing a deal altogether. In this case, selling to John offers a safe and profitable solution."
