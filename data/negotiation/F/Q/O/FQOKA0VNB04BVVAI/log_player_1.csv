Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position,  $950,000 is a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you a significant profit margin while giving me a fair return on the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This would allow us to close the deal and still give you a healthy return.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $980,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a bit closer to my target price of $1,050,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is still significantly better than what John is offering me, and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is a very fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this deal would be a win-win.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I'd hoped for, it's still a good deal and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  There's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and the negotiation will stall, or that I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
