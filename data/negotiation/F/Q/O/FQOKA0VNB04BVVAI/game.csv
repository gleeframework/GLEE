"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position,  $950,000 is a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you a significant profit margin while giving me a fair return on the product's value. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This would allow us to close the deal and still give you a healthy return.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is still significantly better than what John is offering me, and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $990,000, which is a very fair price for both of us. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this deal would be a win-win.  What do you say?",990000.0,Bob,6,
