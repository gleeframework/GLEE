"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
