# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's  fair to both of us. I'm confident we can find a price we're both happy with.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  You are looking to save as much money as possible. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John for $10,000, which is still within your budget.** This is the best option to maximize savings, even though it means paying the full $10,000."
