(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum.  Offering $1,250,000 starts the negotiation with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher.  Continuing negotiations might lead to a lower price.  Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to try to get closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price while still showing Alice he's willing to compromise. Offering $1,300,000 demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, but it's important to maintain some negotiating room for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is determined to save as much money as possible and is getting closer to his target price.  While $1,380,000 is tempting, it's still higher than his ideal.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation rounds and increases the chances of reaching a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price, but also recognizing that Alice may be less willing to drop below a certain point. This offer is a compromise, showing good faith while maintaining the potential for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in round 7 is the same as her initial offer, suggesting she may be unwilling to budge further. Bob has already made several counteroffers and only has 3 rounds left.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to be unproductive, it's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John at a lower price.  The risk of further negotiations and the potential for a worse outcome outweigh the chance of a small further price reduction with Alice."
