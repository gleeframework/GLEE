Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to  $160, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This should encourage him to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's just slightly above my minimum, it's the best deal I can get at this point.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, and selling to John would only yield a slightly higher price."
