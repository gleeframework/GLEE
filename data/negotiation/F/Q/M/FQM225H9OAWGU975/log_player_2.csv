"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting with an asking price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his ideal. This strategy encourages Alice to negotiate further while keeping Bob's position clear."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While $13,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows him to send a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground. He's showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway, but also making it clear that this is his best offer. This encourages Alice to consider accepting the deal, as further negotiation may risk losing the sale."
