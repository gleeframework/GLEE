"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a reduction from her initial value, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the true value of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  You have two options:

* **Reject and counteroffer:**  You can try to get closer to your $800,000 goal with another counteroffer. You might try offering something slightly higher than your maximum to see if you can get a deal.
* **Buy from John:** This is the safest option as it guarantees the lowest price. However, you might miss out on a potential deal with Alice.

Since there's still room for negotiation,  it's worth trying to counteroffer Alice again to see if you can close the gap."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the value of the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  you've already countered several times, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price further. 

Buying from John guarantees the lowest price and avoids further negotiation.  While you might miss out on a potential deal with Alice, you're securing the product for the best price."
