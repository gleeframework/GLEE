"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to pay John's full price makes accepting her offer the best choice in this situation."
