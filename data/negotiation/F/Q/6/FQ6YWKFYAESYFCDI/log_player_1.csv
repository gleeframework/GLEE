I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to John, hoping Bob will counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to ensure I get at least what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a slightly better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,500. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and hopefully close enough to Bob's value that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to sell to him."
