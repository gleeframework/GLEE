"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $11,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** You value the product at $12,000, and Alice's offer is $11,000.  This is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation to save money. 
* **Negotiation:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially when you have a clear upper limit.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore better deals.
* **Alternative:**  You have a fallback option with John at $12,000, so you're not under pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's first offer but is still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Value Difference:** I am aiming to close the gap between our valuations without going too low too quickly. 
* **Building Rapport:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and creates a more collaborative negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $10,250 is still above your target.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Since you have several rounds left, you can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While accepting Alice's offer is a decent deal, it's not the best possible outcome, and you still have time to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $10,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This tactic often leads to a faster agreement, as both parties are making concessions. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** By offering a price close to Alice's last offer, you signal your seriousness about buying while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the message positive and collaborative helps maintain a good negotiation dynamic."
