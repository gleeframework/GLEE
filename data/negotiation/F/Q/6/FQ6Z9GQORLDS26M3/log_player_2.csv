"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping for a price closer to $11,000. It's still a good value for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  Bob is aiming for a substantial discount, starting with a price that is $2000 less than Alice's offer. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  While Bob is pushing for a lower price, the message emphasizes that he still sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** $11,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, so there is room for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with a great deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from $13,000 to $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Approaching a Good Deal:** $12,000 is only $2,000 above Bob's desired price point. It's a good deal for Bob considering he can buy from John for $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price but also risks Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds.  

It's a good time for Bob to take the deal and avoid further potential delays or uncertainties."
