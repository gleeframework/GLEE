Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still potentially appealing to him.  By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially maximize my profit while still allowing for a potential deal.  

I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I will also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for anything lower than that. 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value to see if we can find a compromise.  I also want to make sure I don't lose out on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?  I'm confident this price would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer aims for a middle ground, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I've highlighted the potential benefits for both of us to encourage Bob to consider my offer. I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation, but I'm also prepared to consider John's offer if necessary."
