Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We're willing to negotiate, but not at a loss."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $950,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $1,200,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where walking away makes more sense than continuing to haggle.  By holding firm at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price with John), we're signaling that this is our absolute bottom line. Bob can either meet us at this price or walk away."
