"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,000,000?  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
