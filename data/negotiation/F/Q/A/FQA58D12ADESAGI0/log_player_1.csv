"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $14,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better deal. It's better to accept the $13,500 offer now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away.
