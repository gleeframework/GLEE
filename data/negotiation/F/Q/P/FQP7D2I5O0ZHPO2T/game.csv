"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $15,000.  How about $14,500?  This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,4,
