"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point as it's  above my minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially get closer to Bob's value of $120.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That still leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $85 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's still a decent profit and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away. I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
