"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my ideal price and my fallback option (John). There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a little outside my budget. I would be willing to purchase the product for $7,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $9,500 is still above my fallback price with John.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to being able to meet your price.  Would you consider $8,000 for the product? That's the absolute top of my budget."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

I'm now offering my fallback price to Alice. This lets her know I'm serious but also have a limit.  It will be interesting to see if she's willing to go this low or if I need to reconsider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear that $9,000 is her bottom line.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her below my fallback price with John.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
