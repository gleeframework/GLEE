Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how Alice might approach this and a possible offer:

**Alice's Reasoning**

* **Guaranteed Sale:** Alice has a guaranteed sale with John for $800,000. This is her ""backup plan"".
* **Maximizing Profit:**  She wants to get more than $800,000 from Bob if possible.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A very high price might make Bob walk away, forcing Alice to accept John's offer. 

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $950,000 represents a significant profit margin for Alice while still being potentially appealing to Bob considering the product's value.
* **The Message:** 
    * It's polite and professional.
    * It subtly emphasizes the product's value. 
    * It creates a sense of scarcity (""unique opportunity"").

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** This first offer is just the opening move. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate.
* **Information is Power:** If Alice had more information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product, she could tailor her offer more effectively."
