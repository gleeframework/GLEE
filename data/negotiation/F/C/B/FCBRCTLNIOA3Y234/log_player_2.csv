"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
