,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm ready to compromise. $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's make this deal happen.",940000.0,Alice,5,
