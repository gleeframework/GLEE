"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go as low as $13,000.  How about $14,000, and we have a deal?",14000.0,Alice,5,
