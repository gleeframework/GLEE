,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? It's a great deal for you and still a good price for me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's make a deal!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  $115 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to go up to $125? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
