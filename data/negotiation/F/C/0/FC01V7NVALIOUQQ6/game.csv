"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product that go beyond standard market offerings.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,075,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still representing the true value you'll be receiving.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique aspects of the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be fair to myself regarding its true worth.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a strong point for both of us, recognizing its value while making this a worthwhile deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,050,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, considering its value and the market price. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
