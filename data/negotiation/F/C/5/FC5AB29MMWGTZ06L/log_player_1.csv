"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Gauge Reaction:**  This first offer is a way to see how Bob reacts. If he outright rejects it, it suggests he might be aiming for a price much lower than your minimum. If he counters, it indicates he's serious about potentially buying.
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage as you don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, but Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is above your absolute minimum ($15,000) which is good. However, there's still a significant gap between his offer and your initial asking price. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Not Desperate:** You have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so you're not desperate to accept the first offer that comes your way. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high, but the product really is worth it.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer suggests a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. It's a common tactic that can be effective in moving towards a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, you subtly remind Bob of its benefits, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help you gauge Bob's flexibility. If he accepts $18,000, you've secured a great deal. If he counters again, you'll get a clearer picture of his price ceiling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Small Gain vs. Risk:** While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. Bob might be firm on his budget, and pushing further could lead him to walk away.
* **Time Factor:**  You're now on round 4, and while you have time, dragging out the negotiation too long might not be worth the small potential gain."
