Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $9,850. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $10,000. I can offer it to you for $10,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is signaling that she won't go below $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the difference is becoming increasingly marginal. Accepting the $10,150 offer secures a significant discount compared to John's $12,000 price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away in later rounds."
