"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,200.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $9,850. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $10,000. I can offer it to you for $10,150. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10150.0,Alice,7,
