"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
