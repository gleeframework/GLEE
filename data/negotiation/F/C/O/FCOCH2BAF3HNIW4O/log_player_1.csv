Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Exclusivity and Value:** The message emphasizes that this is a limited-time offer and reminds Bob of the product's high value to incentivize a quick purchase.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
