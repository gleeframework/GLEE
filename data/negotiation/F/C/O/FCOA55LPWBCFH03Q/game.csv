"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I still make a good profit.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price point. How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $950,000.  That way we both get closer to our desired price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $935,000. This is my final offer.",935000.0,Alice,5,
