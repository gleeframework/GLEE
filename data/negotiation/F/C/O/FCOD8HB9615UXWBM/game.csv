"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1100000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1050000.
