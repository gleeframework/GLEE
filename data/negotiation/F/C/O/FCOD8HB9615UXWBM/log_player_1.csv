Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I need to be at least $1,000,000 for this deal to work.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I've already made several concessions, and with only two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better offer from him. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a safe and guaranteed deal."
