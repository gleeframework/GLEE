"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product I'm offering to you. I believe it holds great potential for your business.  My initial price is $2,000,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 meets my minimum threshold, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe Bob is genuinely interested and may be willing to pay more, especially since he acknowledged the product's potential. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price is still very fair considering the potential benefits you'll realize.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is demonstrating a strong interest in the product and is willing to pay more than his initial offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our positions.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1650000. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal. Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through a few rounds and it seems like we're nearing a compromise. Accepting this offer is a good way to end the negotiation and secure a decent profit."
