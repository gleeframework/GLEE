{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you. My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle on $850,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a deal I'm happy with. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a little further. Let's meet at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
