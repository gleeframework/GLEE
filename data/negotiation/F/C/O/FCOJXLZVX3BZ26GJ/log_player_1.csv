This offer is a starting point, acknowledging Bob's value of $1,000,000 but also aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm leaving room for negotiation, while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet in the middle and secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,100,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, and I'm willing to move closer to your suggested price. However, based on my financial situation, I can agree to $1,125,000 for your product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my counteroffer and is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer will still secure a significant profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer."
