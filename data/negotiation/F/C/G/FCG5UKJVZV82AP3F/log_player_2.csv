# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $950,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000. It's time to cut negotiations and go with John."
