Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, giving me some room to maneuver. I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is more than my minimum, I am confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $75? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $72? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for more, $72 is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting rather than risking a further stalemate or having to sell to John for only $80."
