"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good price.  While it's still above Bob's ideal price, it's a significant savings compared to John's price of $12,000.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate won't result in a much lower price, and Bob risks losing the product to another buyer.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
