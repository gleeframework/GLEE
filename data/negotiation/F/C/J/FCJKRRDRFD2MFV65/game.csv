"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1500000. This price reflects the incredible potential of this product. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. Would you consider $1200000 as a starting point for our negotiation?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. However, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1350000.  This represents a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1250000. This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let me know if this is something you could consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
