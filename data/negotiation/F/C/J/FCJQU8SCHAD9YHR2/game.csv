"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
