Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85.  This is still a fair price for me, as it's above my minimum, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not thrilled to be selling to John for $80, it's more than what Bob is offering.  I don't think there's much room for negotiation left, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $80 than risk ending up with less."
