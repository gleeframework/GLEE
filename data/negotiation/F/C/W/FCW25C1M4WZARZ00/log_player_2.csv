"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer. There's no benefit to buying from John for the same price."
