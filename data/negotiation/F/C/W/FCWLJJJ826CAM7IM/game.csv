"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, let's make this happen.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $80.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Alice,5,
