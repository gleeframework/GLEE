"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant gain for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
