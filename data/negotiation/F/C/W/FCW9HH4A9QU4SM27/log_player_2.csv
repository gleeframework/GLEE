Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."

Round 2

{

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. Let's see if we can get her closer to $80."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a price that satisfies both of us. I'm willing to offer the product at $87. This is my final offer before considering another buyer. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is starting to play hardball and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $87. This price is within your acceptable range, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk her selling to someone else and having to buy from John for $120."
