"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for my budget though. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway? I could consider $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
