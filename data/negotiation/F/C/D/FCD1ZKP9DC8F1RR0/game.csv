"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I'll pay $9000? Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go down to $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we meet at $9250? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
