"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down to $1,350,000.  I believe that's a fair reflection of its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
