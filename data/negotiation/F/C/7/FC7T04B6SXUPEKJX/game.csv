"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle at $115? It's just a little more, and we can finally close this deal. ",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $112? I'm really interested in buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,6,
