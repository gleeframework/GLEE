Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than $100, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. $130 is a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $140? This is a great deal considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $140, $135 is a good deal and it's getting closer to the end of our rounds. There's a chance I might get a better offer from John, but it's risky, and I'm not sure if I want to gamble further."
