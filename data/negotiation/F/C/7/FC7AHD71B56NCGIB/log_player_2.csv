"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is the best option if Bob can't get a better price from Alice, but it's worth trying to negotiate first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1,700,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,780,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with this, I'm open to discussing other options, but I'm not going to go any higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,780,000, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Given that Alice has stated she won't go any lower,  and Bob can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John at this point. This ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price."
