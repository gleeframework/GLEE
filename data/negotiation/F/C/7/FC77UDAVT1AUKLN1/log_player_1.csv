Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

It's clear that Bob is very unlikely to move above $12,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer for that same amount from John, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. Holding onto the hope of a slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of missing out on the guaranteed $12,000."
