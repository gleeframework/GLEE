"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some willingness to negotiate from you which I appreciate.  $7,500 is still quite low, how about we split the difference again and settle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,000. Would you consider $8,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear that $8,000 is his absolute limit. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum of $10,000.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
