"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice at $9,000 is cheaper than buying from John at $12,000.
* Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, it's still a better deal for Bob to get it for $9,000 than $12,000."
