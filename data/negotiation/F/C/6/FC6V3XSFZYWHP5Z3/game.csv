"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
