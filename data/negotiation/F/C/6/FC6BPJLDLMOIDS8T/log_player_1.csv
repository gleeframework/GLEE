Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also a good idea to be friendly and open to negotiation right away.  

Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I don't have to settle for anything less than that. But I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiations going."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to stick to my bottom line of $1,200,000 and see if Bob is willing to meet me there.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping that he'll see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,175,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but he's getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value our ongoing discussion, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,187,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1187500}
``` 

I'm aiming for a middle ground, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this shows good faith and makes it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while he's getting closer to my desired price, it seems he's not willing to meet me halfway.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation dragging on. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I can move on to other opportunities."
