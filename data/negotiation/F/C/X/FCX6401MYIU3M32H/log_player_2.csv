Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I need to be closer to that price to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly reluctant to go below $1,100,000. However, we have room to negotiate and time is on our side. By continuing to counter-offer, we might be able to push her down slightly further, even if it's just a small concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This shows I'm serious about buying, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 

**Reasoning:** 

We're splitting the difference again to signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below Alice's sticking point.  This approach keeps the conversation going and maintains a chance for further price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $1,075,000 is definitely getting closer. However, to make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,100,000.  Let's compromise and meet halfway at $1,087,500. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this price is a significant saving compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point, and continuing to push could risk losing the deal altogether."
