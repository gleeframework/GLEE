"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I need to be closer to that price to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This shows I'm serious about buying, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $1,075,000 is definitely getting closer. However, to make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,100,000.  Let's compromise and meet halfway at $1,087,500. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial price.",1087500.0,Alice,7,
