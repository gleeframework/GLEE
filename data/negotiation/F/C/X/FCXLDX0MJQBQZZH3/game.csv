"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value the product could bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1600000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the discount you've already offered. Can you consider this proposal?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $1400000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $1600000 is too low, so I'll go with $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can understand my position. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
