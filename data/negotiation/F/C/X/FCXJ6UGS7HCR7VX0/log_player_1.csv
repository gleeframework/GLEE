"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, so I'm not going to sell to him just yet.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While it's tempting to take $1,300,000, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price.  I need to be close to my $1,500,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum, and I think it's a fair compromise given how early it is in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough. I want to get as close to my minimum as possible, and I have plenty of time to negotiate. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This time I'm going to offer $1,550,000.  This is closer to my minimum and demonstrates I'm serious about getting a deal done.  I believe Bob may be more likely to accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1525000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,525,000.  This is a small decrease from my last offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to a potential compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and while Bob is getting closer to my price, we're running out of time. I'm not confident I can get to my minimum in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my minimum.  It's not ideal, but it's the most practical decision given the circumstances."
