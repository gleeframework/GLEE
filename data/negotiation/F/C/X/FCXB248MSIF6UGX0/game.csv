"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. However, I'm willing to pay $5,000 extra if the product comes with the additional feature I'm interested in. Can we discuss this further?",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the additional feature.  However, I'm not willing to include it for just $5,000 extra.  How about we stick to the original product for now and I'll offer you a price of $890,000.  This is a great price, and we can explore the additional feature later if we're both happy with the initial deal.",890000.0,Alice,7,
