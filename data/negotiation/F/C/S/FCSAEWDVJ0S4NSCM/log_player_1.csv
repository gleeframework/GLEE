{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It also leaves room to move slightly if Bob counters.  I'm confident this is a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It still ensures a profit for me while showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1300000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can we compromise at $1250000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,300,000. I'll counteroffer again and try to get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This would be a great deal for you and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

This counteroffer shows further flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to close the gap with this offer and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1275000. I'm willing to meet you at $1230000, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price with Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to go any higher. At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get the maximum value for my product and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
