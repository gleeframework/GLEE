"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further to get this done.  How about $1,037,500?  That's a significant compromise on my end.",1037500.0,Bob,8,
