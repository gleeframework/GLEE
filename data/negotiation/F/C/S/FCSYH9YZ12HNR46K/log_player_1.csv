"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay something closer to my value. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $10,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my minimum value. This also keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Bob an opportunity to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still lower than my minimum value of $15,000, I'm willing to accept it. There are still 6 rounds remaining, and it's possible I could get a higher price, but the risk of reaching the final round and having to sell to John for $15,000 is too high. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a reasonable profit."
