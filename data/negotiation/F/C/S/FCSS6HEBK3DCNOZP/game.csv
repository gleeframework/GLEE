"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't meet there, I'll have to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
