(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is offering. This is the most aggressive counteroffer I can make while staying within my budget.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this price immediately, but it sets a clear boundary and starts the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to keep the price as low as possible.  This offer is a good compromise between my budget and Alice's likely minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate is lower than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and get closer to her asking price, but I'm still committed to keeping the price within my budget. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Alice and we can close the deal."
