Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that I can get this price from John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the $10,000 I could get from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than what Bob offered, and closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000. To avoid that risk, I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
