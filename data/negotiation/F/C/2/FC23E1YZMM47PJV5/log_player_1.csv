"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $1,800,000. This is a significant premium over Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, and this price might be enticing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, and I'm starting to think that John might be a better option at this point.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this is close enough to my floor that he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and his offers are still far below my minimum.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a safer option than risking another round of negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
