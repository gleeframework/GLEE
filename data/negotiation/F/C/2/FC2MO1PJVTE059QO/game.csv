,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $900000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a bit closer to your offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a constructive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $887500. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",887500.0,Alice,5,
