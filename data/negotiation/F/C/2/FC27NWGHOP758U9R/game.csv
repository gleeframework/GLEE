"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! It's something that's really worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a very competitive price. How does $120 sound?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the price, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $110? This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to go up to $105 for the product. I hope this works for you.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $105 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
