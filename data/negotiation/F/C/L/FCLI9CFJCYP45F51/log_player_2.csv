"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a competitive price of $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer. How about $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. I'm getting closer to my desired price but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unwilling to go below $10,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, making further negotiation with Alice pointless. It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
