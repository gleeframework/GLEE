"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer. How about $9,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. I'm getting closer to my desired price but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,5,
