"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in its value, my budget allows me to offer a maximum of $500000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value far exceeds that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet you halfway at $1200000. My maximum offer remains at $500000. I hope we can continue our discussion to find a mutually beneficial solution.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I really value the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $600000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $600000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
