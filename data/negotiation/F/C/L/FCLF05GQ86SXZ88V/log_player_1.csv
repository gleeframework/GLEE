Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, channeling your inner Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.  
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob tends to be a tough negotiator or is put off by aggressive opening offers, you might adjust the price and tone accordingly.
* **Risk Tolerance:** A very high offer increases the chance of Bob rejecting it outright.  You need to balance potential profit with the risk of losing him as a buyer."
