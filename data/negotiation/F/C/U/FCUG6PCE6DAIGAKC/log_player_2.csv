Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,300,000.  This still allows me to profit, and it's a much fairer price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John instead.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  Since you know John will sell the product for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $50,000."
