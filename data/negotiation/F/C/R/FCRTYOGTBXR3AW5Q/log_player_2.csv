"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a steal at $200. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than our true limit ($60 vs. $80). This gives us room to negotiate upwards and still get a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting low, we signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a discount and are willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  Keep in mind we always have the option to buy from John at $80 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $170. That's already a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $170 is still significantly higher than both our target price ($80) and our fallback option (John at $80).
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to get the price lower. We'll continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still more than I'm willing to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump but Still Below Limit:**  We're raising our offer significantly to show Alice we're serious, but we're still well below both our limit ($80) and her previous offer ($170).
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Strategy:**  Suggesting $100 frames the negotiation as finding a compromise, which can be a persuasive tactic. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We want to keep the negotiation going and see if Alice is willing to move closer to a price we find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product. Let's close the gap - how about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $130 is still significantly more than our $80 target and our John backup.
* **Time to Push:** We're over halfway through the rounds, so it's time to push a bit harder to see if Alice will come down closer to a price we're happy with. 
* **John is Still an Option:** We'll keep John in mind as we head into the later rounds. If the negotiations stall, we can always take his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $110, but that's really stretching my budget."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making another significant jump to $110, but framing it as a stretch shows Alice we're serious and nearing our limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to meet us somewhere around $110, we can likely get a deal. If not, we may need to consider John more seriously.
* **Limited Rounds Remain:**  With fewer rounds left, we're increasing the pressure to reach an agreement soon."
