"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and both Alice and John are offering the product for the same price ($1,500,000), rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. This leaves you open to potentially negotiating a better price with Alice or finding another seller who might be willing to sell for less."
