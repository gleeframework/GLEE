Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My starting price is $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you're seeking.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is far too low. I will continue negotiations to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows us to find a middle ground.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000, as a final offer to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find common ground and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  Selling to John ensures I get the value I need for the product, and I can't risk further negotiations with Bob."
