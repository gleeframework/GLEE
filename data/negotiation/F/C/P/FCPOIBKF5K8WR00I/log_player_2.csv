"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your business. My starting price is $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $800,000. I need to negotiate and try to get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you're seeking.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's starting price, but it's still within a range that reflects the value of the product.  I'm starting with a lower price to see if she's willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this initial counteroffer will open the door for further discussions and a possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high. I'm not willing to go above my budget of $800,000. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate. I believe we can find a solution that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows us to find a middle ground.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer but gives her room to come down without feeling like she's completely giving in.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000, as a final offer to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get her down to my price. I have 5 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find common ground and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. I've demonstrated my willingness to negotiate, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. By repeating my offer, I hope to show Alice that I'm serious about this price and encourage her to reconsider."
