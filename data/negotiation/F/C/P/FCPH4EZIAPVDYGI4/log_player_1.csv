Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value allows you to assess his level of interest. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can always come down.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, be prepared for Bob to reject the offer.  If that happens, you can always negotiate downwards or proceed with selling to John."
