Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe Bob will be motivated to accept, as he values the product at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a profitable deal for myself. I believe this price is fair and will likely lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's last offer of $920,000 is not acceptable, and I believe continuing the negotiation will likely lead to a stalemate or a price too close to John's offer.  It's better to secure the $800,000 now and move on."
