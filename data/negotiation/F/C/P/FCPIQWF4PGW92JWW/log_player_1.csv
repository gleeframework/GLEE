"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $175. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $140 is simply not acceptable. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $160? That's still a great price for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $145? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough for me to be satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155, which would be $150. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price, I've already spent several rounds negotiating and haven't made any progress towards a higher price. It's clear that Bob is willing to pay my minimum, but no more. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, as he's guaranteed to purchase at that price."
