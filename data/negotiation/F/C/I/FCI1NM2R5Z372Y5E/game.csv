"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you are willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
