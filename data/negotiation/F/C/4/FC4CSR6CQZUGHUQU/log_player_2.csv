"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you value it at $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but your goal is to save money. 
* Alice is bluffing; she knows you're a serious buyer and she'd rather get $12,000 from you than risk losing the sale.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, potentially making her more open to a lower price."
