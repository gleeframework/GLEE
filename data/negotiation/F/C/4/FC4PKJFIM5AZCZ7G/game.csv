"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for us both,  $1,300,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Would you consider $1,450,000? I believe this price reflects a fairer compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This price seems more reasonable to me, considering the product's value and my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
