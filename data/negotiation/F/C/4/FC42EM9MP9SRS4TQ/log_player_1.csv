Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible, maximizing my profit. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a strong, confident offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so I'm willing to walk away if Bob rejects this offer."
