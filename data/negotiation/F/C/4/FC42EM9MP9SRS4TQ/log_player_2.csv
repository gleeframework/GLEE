"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not by much.** You'd still be paying more than the product is worth to Alice.
* **You have leverage.** You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This gives you room to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer encourages negotiation.** By rejecting, you show Alice that you're serious about getting a better price.

**Next steps:**

You should counter Alice's offer. You could propose a price closer to $800,000, or maybe $900,000.  This shows that you're willing to negotiate but also value the product."
