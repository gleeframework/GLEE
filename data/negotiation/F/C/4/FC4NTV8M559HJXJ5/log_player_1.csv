Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant returns on your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $2,000,000. Selling to John right now would be giving up on potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product has a lot of potential and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so how about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has hit my absolute minimum price.  There's no room for negotiation left, and it's unlikely he'll go higher. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's potential future lowball offers."
