"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is far below the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to reduce the price to $1300000.  This gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1300000. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $1250000. This is a significant concession, and it's as low as I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit.  I'm confident you'll see this as a great deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1150000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, my absolute minimum.  This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's a price you'll be happy with.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1160000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider?",1160000.0,Bob,8,
