"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While I'm interested in selling, $8000 is significantly less than my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you than that. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This would give you a great deal and still allow me to reach my target price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round.  It's worth seeing if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500, which would be $9250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum price with Bob's offer of $9,250, the negotiations are taking longer than expected. To ensure I reach my minimum price of $10,000, I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him."
