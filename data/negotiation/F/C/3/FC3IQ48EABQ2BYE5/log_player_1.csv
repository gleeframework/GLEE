{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 gives me room to negotiate down.  I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this leaves a cushion for potential compromise.
* **Friendly Tone:** Keeping the message friendly and inviting is important for maintaining a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for compromise:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows interest and opens the door for further negotiation.  
* **Selling to John is a viable option:**  $12,000 is my minimum, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  However, I'm willing to explore a counteroffer with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not closing the door on a deal. My counteroffer is a compromise that's closer to his offer than mine, but still above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning ""meeting in the middle."" This makes it seem like a fair and reasonable compromise.
* **Maintaining positive tone:** I'm keeping the message polite and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  While it's closer, accepting it would still result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested and is showing a willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance we can reach a price closer to my target with another counteroffer.
* **Guaranteed alternative:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I want to maximize my profits. I'm willing to take one more chance with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try one more time. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can do. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $10,500 is my absolute lowest price, and I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that this is a significant compromise on my part to show Bob that I'm being reasonable.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer. 
* **Pressure to Accept:**  By making it my ""final"" offer, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10500, so how about $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum of $12,000, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile.  I'm taking a loss by accepting it.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Bob is clearly at his limit, and any further negotiation would likely result in a lower price for me. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $12,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

Even though I'm close to a deal with Bob, it's important to be strategic and prioritize my financial well-being.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who is willing to pay closer to my asking price."
