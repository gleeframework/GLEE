"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
