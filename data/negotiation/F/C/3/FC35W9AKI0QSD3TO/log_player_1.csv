This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $150, giving you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$80 is far too low, below your minimum acceptable price. It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still a little lower than you'd ideally like. You can likely push for a slightly higher price, so it's best to reject this offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $120 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Would you be willing to go down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to your minimum, but $110 is still too low for you.  At this point, it's not worth risking the sale to try to squeeze out a few more dollars.  You can get a guaranteed $150 from John, which is more than what Bob is offering and meets your minimum acceptable price."
