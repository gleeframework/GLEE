"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her value than to mine. I have room to negotiate down towards my $8,000 limit, knowing I always have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair starting point."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a low offer (significantly below my $8,000 maximum) gives me the most room to negotiate upwards. It also tests Alice's willingness to move significantly from her initial price.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation even with a lowball offer.
* **Strategic Justification:** Offering a reason (budget constraints) helps justify the low offer without revealing my true upper limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $9,000 is still above my fallback option of buying from John for $8,000.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make the deal."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm revealing my upper limit, signaling that this is my best and final offer. However, I'm doing it in a way that doesn't shut down the negotiation entirely. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying I'm ""ready to make the deal,"" I'm implying that I might consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge.
* **Targeting a Win-Win:** Alice gets a price significantly above my initial offer, and I get the product at my maximum price, potentially saving me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to come down to my maximum price. It seems we've reached an impasse.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better deal for me. It's time to exercise my backup option and buy from John for $8,000."
