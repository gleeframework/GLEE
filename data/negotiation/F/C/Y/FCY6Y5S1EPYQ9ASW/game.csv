"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
