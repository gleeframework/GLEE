"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $108. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and value.",108.0,Alice,5,
