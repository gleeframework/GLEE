"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will reject this offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his willingness to pay.  I'm confident that I can close the deal with John for $15,000 if necessary, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $15,000 by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can get even closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own to see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering the product for my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is fair, considering it's still less than what I could get from John, and it's only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  This is a crucial point in the negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him closer to my desired price.  This will be a crucial round, and I'm going to need to be strategic in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to offer a price halfway between my previous offer of $15,000 and Bob's latest offer of $13,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to settle for a significantly lower price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or, if necessary, close the deal with John for $15,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less than I feel the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $14,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it's enough to persuade Bob to accept.  We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  If this offer fails, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, but I'm still holding out hope for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best option given the current circumstances."
