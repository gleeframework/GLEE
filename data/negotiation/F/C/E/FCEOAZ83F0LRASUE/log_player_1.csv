You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price point, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer. We are still early in the negotiation process."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $980,000? It's a bit closer to what I can afford, while still acknowledging the product's value.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, we are still $40,000 apart. I'm willing to play hardball for one more round to see if I can push him a bit further. I'll use the guaranteed offer from John as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I have other potential buyers for this price.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for this deal, but this is my absolute final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm putting a firm line in the sand with the $1,000,000 offer. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about closing the deal at this price.  By mentioning other buyers (even though I'll accept John's offer if Bob refuses), I'm adding a bit of pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the negotiations so far, I think $990,000 is a reasonable price for the product. Let me know if this aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to squeeze a bit more, accepting $990,000 is a good outcome. It's a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and only slightly below my target price.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk Bob walking away or getting stuck in an endless loop of small concessions."
