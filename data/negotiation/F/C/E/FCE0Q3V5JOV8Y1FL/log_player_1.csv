Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant profit for me, but leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately accept John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is still a good profit, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, and still a good profit for me."
