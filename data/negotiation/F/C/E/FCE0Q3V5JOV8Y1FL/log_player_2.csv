"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,000,000.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than the product's value to Alice. This gives Alice a reason to negotiate but also shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $950,000 is still above the product's value to Alice, it's a reasonable compromise that saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
