"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,600,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
