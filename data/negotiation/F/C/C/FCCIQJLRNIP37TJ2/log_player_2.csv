"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above my target price of $1,200,000, but still within my budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,375,000 is closer to my target price and still within my budget.  It's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John.  I'll accept the offer."
