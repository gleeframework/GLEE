"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I know you've been seeking something like it for a while. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's true value is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a significant compromise while still acknowledging the inherent value of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 remains beyond my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,225,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your position.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,225,000 is closer, I'm still limited by my budget.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product. I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I value your persistence in finding the right deal. How about we settle at $1,180,000?  This is a significant offer on my part, reflecting my desire to see this transaction through with you.",1180000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,180,000 is closer, I'm still limited by my budget. Let's try $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in the product.  I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
