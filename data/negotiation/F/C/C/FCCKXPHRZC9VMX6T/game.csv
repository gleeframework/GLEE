"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50? That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",132.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Bob,4,
