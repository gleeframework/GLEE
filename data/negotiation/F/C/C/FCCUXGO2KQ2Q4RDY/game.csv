"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good price for this unique product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be though.  How about $13000? It's a fair compromise that would let us both move forward.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. How about $14500? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $13500. It's a reasonable price that reflects the value we're both seeing in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about $14250? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer!  $14250 is a good number, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  I think this is a fair price considering how much we've both moved. Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14000. However, I'm not quite ready to give in just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about $13750? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle to get a deal done.",13750.0,Alice,9,
