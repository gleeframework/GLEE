Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point, but here's why I chose it:

* **Not too aggressive:**  $100 is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum.
* **Friendly tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and inviting can help keep the negotiation positive.
* **Open to discussion:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation. 

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a better price than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling it at that price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $90."
