"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  It's still a good deal for you and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $107.50? This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price.",107.5,Alice,5,
