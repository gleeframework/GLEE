"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone.**  Negotiation is more successful with a good rapport.
* **Express interest in the product** to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Provide a reason for the counteroffer** (""a bit too steep""). 
* **Suggest a significantly lower price ($100)** to provide room for negotiation, but still stay within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price, it's still above what John is offering. You have room to counteroffer again and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. How about we settle at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Alice's compromise:** Shows you recognize she's moving towards your price range, encouraging continued negotiation. 
* **Suggests a mutually beneficial price:**  $110 is a significant saving for you, but still a decent profit for Alice compared to her alternative.
* **Maintains a positive and collaborative tone:** Important for keeping the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125. Since you can get the product for $120 from John, it's no longer worth the effort of further negotiation. It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
