"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the value and potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
