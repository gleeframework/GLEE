"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it would be a great asset.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While you could get the product for $12,000 from John, Alice's offer of $11,000 saves you money.  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, so accepting a lower price is the best move."
