{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This means Bob has room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves you plenty of room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not desperate. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer at this stage. I'll send him a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000? That's a fair price that still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own needs.
* **Is still above Bob's offer:**  I'm not giving in to his initial counteroffer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** By suggesting a ""fair price,"" I'm implying that this is a good deal he might not want to miss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more substantial offer from Bob before accepting.  I'll send him a counteroffer to gauge his true willingness to meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $1,200,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows further flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm truly committed to reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Is a compromise:** I'm meeting him halfway between our previous offers.
* **Reiterates the value:**  I'm reminding him of the product's worth, subtly implying that this is a good deal for him.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** I'm asking for his opinion, implying that this might be our last chance to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you consider this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price point.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.  Instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get the minimum price I'm looking for and avoids further delays and potential frustration."
