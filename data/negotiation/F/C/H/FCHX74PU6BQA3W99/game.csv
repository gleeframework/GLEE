"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000? That's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $1,200,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you consider this price point?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
