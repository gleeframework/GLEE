"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for your product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $800,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
