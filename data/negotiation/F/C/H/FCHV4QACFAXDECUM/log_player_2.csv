Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
