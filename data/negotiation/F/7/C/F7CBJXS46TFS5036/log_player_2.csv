"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. This exceptional item is worth more than $10000 to me, but I believe in fair trade and am willing to consider your valuation. To start our negotiation, I am offering the product for $15000. I look forward to discussing how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
