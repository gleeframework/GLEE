{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to compromise.  We'll see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more like $9,500. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to get the best deal I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has come up to $9,500. That's pretty close to my ideal price and significantly better than selling to John. It's time to close the deal!"
