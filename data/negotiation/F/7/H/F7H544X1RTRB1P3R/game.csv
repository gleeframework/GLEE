"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significant, and I can't go as low as $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
