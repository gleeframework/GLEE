Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice is clearly holding firm around $1,200,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. Accepting her offer gets us the product below our maximum budget."
