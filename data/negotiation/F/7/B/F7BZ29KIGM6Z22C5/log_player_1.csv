Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum acceptable price:**  I need to make at least $12,000 to be happy with the sale, as that's what John is offering.
* **Potential for higher profit:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum.  
* **Uncertainty about Bob's value:**  Since I don't know what Bob is willing to pay, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob is willing to pay more, I'll make more money. If not, I'm still guaranteed to get my minimum from John. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
