"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12500. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no need to pay more if he doesn't have to.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000?  That's a significant savings for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can offer it to you for $13000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. $13,000 is still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will budge further.  There's no need to pay more if he can get the product at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $12800. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. He has reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,800, and he's already rejected several offers that were higher than John's price. 

It's better to cut his losses and get the product for a guaranteed price from John, rather than risk further negotiation with Alice.  He's already saved a considerable amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer."
