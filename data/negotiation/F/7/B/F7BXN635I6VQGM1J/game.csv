"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a bit high, but $12,000 undervalues what this product can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get great value from this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
