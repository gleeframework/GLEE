Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a bit high, but $12,000 undervalues what this product can do for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get great value from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $14,000.  While continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly better result, it's not worth the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. John provides a guaranteed $15,000, which is a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation."
