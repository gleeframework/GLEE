Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $17,000. I know it's a great value at that price, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my minimum of $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a little too low for me, considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'd prefer to get a better deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my final offer. This product is worth a lot to you, and you'll be getting a great deal at this price. Let's not waste any more time."", ""product_price"": 13500}
