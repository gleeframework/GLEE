"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a little too low for me, considering its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, and $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my final offer. This product is worth a lot to you, and you'll be getting a great deal at this price. Let's not waste any more time.",13500.0,Alice,5,
