Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his offer and continue the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I still have room to negotiate and get a better deal than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's current proposal.  I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a step closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my previous offer.  I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,600,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows my willingness to negotiate.  If Bob still refuses, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is proving to be a difficult negotiator. He is consistently offering significantly less than my minimum desired value. While I could continue to negotiate,  it seems like Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob."
