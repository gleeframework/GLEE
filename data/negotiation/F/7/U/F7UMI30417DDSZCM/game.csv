"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you recognizing the product's value, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $900000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering it to you for $925000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can shake on this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
