Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  This also allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and only $1,000 less than my initial offer. Accepting his offer is a good move as it ensures a quick sale and secures a decent profit."
