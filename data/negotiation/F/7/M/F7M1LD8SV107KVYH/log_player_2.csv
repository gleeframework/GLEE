"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1200000.  This is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a great deal.
