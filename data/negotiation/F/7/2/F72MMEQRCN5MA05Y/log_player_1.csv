Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have another buyer lined up.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but pushing too aggressively risks Bob rejecting the offer. Here's a strategy that balances risk and reward:

1. **Aim High:** Start with an offer closer to Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation but signaling the product's worth.
2. **Confidence:**  Project confidence in your offer. Don't appear desperate to sell.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Strong Opening:** $1,400,000 captures a significant portion of the potential surplus while leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're open to discussion if Bob has concerns, but you're starting from a position of strength.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could walk away.  Negotiation involves elements of risk, and this approach balances maximizing potential gain with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
