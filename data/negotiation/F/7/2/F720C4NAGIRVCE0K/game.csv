"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see the value in the product,  $11000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $10500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",10800.0,Alice,3,
