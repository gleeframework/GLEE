Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $145. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at $145 gives Bob a tempting discount while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I've started high, the slightly negotiable price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested. This keeps the door open for a deal.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price of $150."
