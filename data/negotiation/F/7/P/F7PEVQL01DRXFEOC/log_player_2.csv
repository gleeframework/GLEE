# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you first for $180. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to me. Alice's offer of $180 is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your interest in selling to me, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

$130 is still too high for me. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
