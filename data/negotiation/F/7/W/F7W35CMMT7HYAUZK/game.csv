"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer to what I need, but I can't go that low. How about we settle at $11,250 and we have a deal?",11250.0,Alice,5,
