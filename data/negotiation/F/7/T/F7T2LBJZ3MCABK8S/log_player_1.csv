Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'd like to offer $750000. This reflects my understanding of the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.
