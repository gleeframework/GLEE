{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Profit:** This price gives me a significant profit of $400,000, which is a good outcome considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **Attractiveness to Bob:**  While Bob values the product at $1,500,000,  he still receives a $100,000 benefit by purchasing it at this price. This is a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for $1,000,000,  so I'm not taking a huge risk. 

By offering this price, I'm maximizing my chances of getting the best possible price while still leaving room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement."
