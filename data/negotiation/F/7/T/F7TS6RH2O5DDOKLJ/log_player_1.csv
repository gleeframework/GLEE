Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that allows for some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message might encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I can counteroffer and try to find a price that is mutually agreeable, potentially closer to my target price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John ensures a profit, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still gives me a good price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging. 

This counteroffer should hopefully appeal to Bob while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I'd prefer $150, accepting this offer might open the door to future business with Bob. He seems willing to negotiate, and I might be able to get a better price from him in the future.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I could lose out on potential sales to other buyers.

I'm willing to take a slight discount to secure the sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob."
