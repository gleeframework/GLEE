Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a significant discount from your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  The value this product brings to the table is undeniable, and I'm confident it can make a substantial difference in your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your initial asking price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still a good margin above our fallback price with John. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. Let's see if we can nudge him a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your approach.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $985,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair valuation of the product's potential impact on your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $985,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly negotiating in good faith and moving closer to our price. While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting $975,000 guarantees a significant profit above our fallback option with John and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
