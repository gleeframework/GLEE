"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it, considering the potential benefits. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $16000 for the product. This still reflects its high value and potential benefits for your business, while being more within your current budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  To reach a deal, I'm willing to offer $15500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
