"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",80.0,Bob,4,
