"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the product from John for that amount.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm able to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I can get it from John for that amount. Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
