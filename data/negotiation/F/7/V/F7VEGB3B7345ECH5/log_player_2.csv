"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth a lot to you, and I think this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer process and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original $900,000 offer to $850,000. This is a good price for Bob, as it's still below his maximum budget of $1,000,000 and saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
