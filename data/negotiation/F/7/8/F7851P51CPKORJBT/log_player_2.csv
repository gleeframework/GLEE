Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to keep negotiating, Bob. I think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm getting from this deal. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,500, and you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals come from knowing your alternatives."
