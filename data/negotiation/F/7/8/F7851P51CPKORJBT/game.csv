"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $14,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to keep negotiating, Bob. I think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $13,000? It's still a bit above your valuation, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm getting from this deal. I can do $12,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale.",12500.0,Alice,7,
