Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product's value to Bob justifies this price, and I'm hoping to get a good deal in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to get closer to his valuation while still getting a good price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  This counteroffer could be the sweet spot to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come down to $130, which is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to close the deal now than risk losing him and having to settle for John's lower offer."
