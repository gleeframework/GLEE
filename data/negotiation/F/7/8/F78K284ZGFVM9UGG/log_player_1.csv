While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $17,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  Even at $17,000, I'm still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, securing a good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation further risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now ensures a quick and profitable sale.
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will go higher, and I risk leaving money on the table if he walks away.

Accepting the $17,000 offer represents a solid balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk in this negotiation."
