Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.  Any price within this range can potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the highest price Bob is willing to pay without going above his perceived value. Since you have a guaranteed backup offer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product.  Given its market potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term value."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's value. 
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""unique product"" and ""fair deal""  emphasize the product's worth.
* **Focus on Long-Term Value:** This subtly downplays the immediate cost and suggests potential future gains for Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Don't Reveal Your Backup:** Keep your deal with John confidential. Revealing it weakens your position. 
* **Be Willing to Walk Away:**  If Bob won't offer a price close to your minimum, you're better off selling to John."
