"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup, and Bob has no reason to accept it at this point. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price. There's still room for compromise and Bob can potentially save more money."
