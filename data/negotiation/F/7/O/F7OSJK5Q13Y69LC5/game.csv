"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $150 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $130, which is $140. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
