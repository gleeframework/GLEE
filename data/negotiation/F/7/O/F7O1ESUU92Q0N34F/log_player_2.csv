"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to tell you about this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm initially offering it at $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still above my budget.  I can likely negotiate a better price, especially since she rejected my initial counteroffer.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000? This is the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
