Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and potentially save on time and effort.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price close to your minimum ($150) but slightly below creates the perception of a deal for Bob. The ""limited time"" element adds a sense of urgency.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is firm, the slightly lower price might deter Bob from countering with an extremely low offer. 

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to get a slightly higher price than John's offer."
