"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and encouraging Bob to close the deal."
