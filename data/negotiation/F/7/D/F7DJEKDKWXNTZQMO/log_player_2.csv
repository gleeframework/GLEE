Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's better than her original offer, it's still over my maximum budget.  I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $80."
