"I'm still not comfortable with the price at $14000. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting a bit tired of the back and forth, and I'm still not comfortable with the price at $14250. I'm willing to meet you at $13750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a better offer, I might have to look elsewhere.",13750.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not getting any more patient. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but that's it. If I don't get a better offer, I'm going to have to walk away and buy from John. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,10,
