"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's maximum budget. This should open the door for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, so it's best to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is Bob's maximum budget. By offering this price, Bob signals his willingness to close the deal, but also emphasizes his firm price limit. This could lead to Alice accepting the offer, or to further negotiation."
