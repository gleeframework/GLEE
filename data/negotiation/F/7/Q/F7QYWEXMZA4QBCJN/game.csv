"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you at $900000. This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
