"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get the price down closer to her value of $800,000 before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down to $900,000.  If that doesn't work, I might consider buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, and it's a fair compromise. It's better than buying from John for $1,200,000. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and I'm satisfied with this deal."
