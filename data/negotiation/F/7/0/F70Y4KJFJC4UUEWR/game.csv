"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
