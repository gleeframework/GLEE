"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I am interested.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. Is that more in line with what you're looking for?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle",18000.0,Alice,5,
