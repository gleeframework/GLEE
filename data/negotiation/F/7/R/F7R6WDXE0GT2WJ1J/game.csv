"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750. This would allow both of us to get a fair deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think I can get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing if we can reach a final agreement. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,7,
