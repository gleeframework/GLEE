"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but maximizing my potential profit.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price, hoping to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to negotiating further.

This initial offer balances the need to secure a high price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. How about we start at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he clearly values the product at $1,000,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  While there's a risk of losing Bob,  I'm willing to take that risk at this point because John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is my minimum threshold.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain the opportunity to secure a higher price while maintaining the backup option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap with Bob while still securing a profitable deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has shown a willingness to increase his offer.  I believe there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have the option of selling to John for $800,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to secure a price closer to my target while still having a guaranteed backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Setting my minimum:**  I'm clearly stating that $800,000 is my absolute minimum price, leaving no room for further negotiation on my end.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, reinforcing that this is a good deal for him.
* **Creating urgency:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a firm but fair offer that aims to close the deal while still meeting my minimum requirements."
