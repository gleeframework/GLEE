Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has gone as low as she likely will. Accepting this offer gets you the product at its value to her, which is a good outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks her walking away or you having to settle for a worse deal as your other option is less appealing."
