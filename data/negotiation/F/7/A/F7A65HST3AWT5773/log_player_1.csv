``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $900,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, but if this next offer is rejected, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
