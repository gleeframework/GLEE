"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Bob can still likely get a better price, especially since Alice has already lowered her price. He should counter with a higher offer than $1,000,000, but lower than $1,100,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, Bob. However, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has made multiple concessions and Bob is getting a good price, considering he can buy it from John for $1,500,000.  It's time to accept the offer."
