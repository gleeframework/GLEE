Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $145. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring you get significantly more than his perceived value. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price can make the offer seem more attractive to Bob."
