"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while leaving room for both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $12,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product and your willingness to pay $11,000, I am willing to consider $11,500 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but also wants to buy the product. Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000, but it's significantly lower than the $15,000 he would pay to John.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise: it gets Bob the product at a price that's lower than John's, and it's close enough to Bob's target price to be acceptable."
