Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation but high enough to entice Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision. 

**Why this strategy?**

This offer aims to find a middle ground where Bob sees significant value (saving $100,000 from his perceived worth) and Alice secures a substantial profit (gaining $300,000 over her minimum).  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
