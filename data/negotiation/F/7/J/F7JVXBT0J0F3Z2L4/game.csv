"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider coming down to $14,500.  This is a high-quality product, and I believe it will bring you a lot of value.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $14,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $12,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from another seller for $10,000. I believe it's a reasonable offer considering your alternative.",10500.0,Bob,6,
