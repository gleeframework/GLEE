Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, earning me more profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly better price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential of earning an extra $40 (compared to selling to John) makes it a risk worth taking."
