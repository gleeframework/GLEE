Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that Bob's perceived value of the product is unknown, and there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only $30,000 less than my last counteroffer. I think it's reasonable to accept this offer and close the deal. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with the less desirable option of selling to John for $800,000."
