"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I still believe I can get a better price from Bob or I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I've had 4 rounds of negotiations and I'm still not confident we can reach a deal that meets my needs.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 and avoid any further haggling."
