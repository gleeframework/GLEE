"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, you're not saving any money by accepting. You're essentially getting the product for its maximum value to you.  

The better option is to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, as you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer."
