Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than what the product is worth to you, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a decent discount.  

I've chosen to start at $10,000 because:

* **It's a significant discount:**  Bob sees a potential saving of $2,000, making the offer attractive.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you can still potentially make a profit. 
* **It's a clear signal of your willingness to deal:** By making an offer, you're showing Bob that you're open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,250 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's better than selling the product to John for $12,000."
