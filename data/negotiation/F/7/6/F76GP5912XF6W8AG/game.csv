"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is definitely interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",650000.0,Alice,5,
