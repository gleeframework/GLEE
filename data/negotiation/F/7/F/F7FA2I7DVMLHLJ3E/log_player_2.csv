"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $700,000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $650,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably in price, and further haggling may not yield a significantly better outcome. $650,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving $150,000 off her initial offer."
