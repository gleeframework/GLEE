"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value I'm offering is competitive. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me. I've chosen a price above Bob's estimated value, but I've also added a message that highlights the value and competitiveness of the offer. This should incentivize Bob to consider the deal and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $950,000. My minimum acceptable price is $1,050,000.  This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and I'd like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. I understand the value of your product, and I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John at the same price is an option, but this deal with Bob provides a quicker and more direct solution."
