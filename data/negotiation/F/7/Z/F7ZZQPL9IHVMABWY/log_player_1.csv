Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, offering it at that price guarantees a sale. This maximizes my earnings while still ensuring a deal. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for the same price, so there's no incentive to offer a lower price."
