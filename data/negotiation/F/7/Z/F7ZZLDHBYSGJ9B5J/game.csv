"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $1500000 is at the very top of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1400000? This gives us both some room to compromise and ensures a fair deal for everyone involved.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1300000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
