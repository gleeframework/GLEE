Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. It's also below Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's a reasonable price, and it's more than I would get from selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer."
