"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good starting price, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $100 leaves room for both of us to negotiate, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message shows I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I'm aiming for at least $80, and Bob's offer is right at that minimum.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left, and I can try to get a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get at least $90 for this product. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but $90 is my absolute minimum.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:**  I'm increasing the price from Bob's offer by $5, which is a smaller increase than my initial offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'm stating my absolute minimum but also expressing willingness to negotiate, making myself seem open to a compromise. 
* **Keep the conversation friendly:**  Maintaining a positive tone can help us find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is only $2 away from my minimum price of $80.
* **Time pressure:** We're only in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether by being too stubborn. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting his offer, I can always try to build a good relationship with Bob and potentially get a better deal from him in the future."
