"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $100 to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to pay $87 for it.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87 isn't quite there for me. Let's try $89. It's a small jump, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any closer to your price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $89. I'll pay $88 for it.",88.0,Bob,6,
