"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for. How about we settle on $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
