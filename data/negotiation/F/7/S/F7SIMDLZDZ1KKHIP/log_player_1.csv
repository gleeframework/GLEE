Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, considering its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and any further negotiation will cut into the potential profit. Taking John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice in this scenario."
