"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in [product name], $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  There's a lot of value in [product name] that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $2,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $2,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is closer, it's still above what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,850,000 for [product name]. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's try to wrap this up. How about $1,925,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us given the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $1,925,000 is still too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1875000}
