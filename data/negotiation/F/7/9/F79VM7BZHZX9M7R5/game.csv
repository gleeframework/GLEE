"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a very good price for you, and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
