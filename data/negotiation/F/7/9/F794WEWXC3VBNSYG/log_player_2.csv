"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  There's still room to try and get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $860,000.  This is a fair price that ensures both of us get a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. While there is still a slight difference, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal."
