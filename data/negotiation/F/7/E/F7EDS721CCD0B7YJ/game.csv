"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential you see in the product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price. Let's try $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
