# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
