"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more than $12,500 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,
