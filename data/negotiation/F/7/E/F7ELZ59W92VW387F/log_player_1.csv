Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't get a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better offer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  At this point, I'm confident I can secure my desired price by selling to John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting an even lower offer. I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000."
