"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $80 is a more reasonable price considering its value. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $87.5 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $91.25. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $88? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to be flexible, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm prepared to offer the product for $90.  That's a good compromise, and allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Can you meet me at $89? I think that's the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting $89 is the best option at this point.  It's above my minimum threshold of $80 and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling to John would be a lower price and risking further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a better outcome."
