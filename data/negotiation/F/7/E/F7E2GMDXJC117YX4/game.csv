"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's seal the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
