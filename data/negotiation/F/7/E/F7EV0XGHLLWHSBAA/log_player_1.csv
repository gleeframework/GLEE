"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of the value I place on the product.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm framing the offer as an ""opportunity"" and highlighting the potential, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message conveys a willingness to negotiate, while still establishing a strong initial position.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This makes it crucial to balance being aggressive with being reasonable. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $1200000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my floor of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob acknowledges the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. This indicates potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain my negotiating power and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I'll also reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to come up with a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I believe the product's potential warrants a higher price. How about $1,400,000?  This would still be a significant bargain considering the value I know this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and could make Bob feel like he's making progress.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential and framing the price as a ""bargain."" This reinforces my belief in its worth.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I get a satisfactory return.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a swift resolution. By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to reach an agreement quickly. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be prepared to make further concessions, but I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to pay $1350000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though this isn't my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer might lead to future opportunities with him. He seems willing to negotiate and understands the value of the product. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point. It secures a significant profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
