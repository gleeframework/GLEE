"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get this product at a discount, and I believe it's a deal you won't want to pass up. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
