While $160 is better than $180, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for me. Even though we've been negotiating, I'm not confident I can get her down to my target price. I'm going to go with John's offer of $120, which is the best I can do."
