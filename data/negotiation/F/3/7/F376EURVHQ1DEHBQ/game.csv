"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $180. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $130.  Let me know if you're willing to go down to that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet at $145? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not able to go higher than $135. This is the absolute maximum I can do.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to move on.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your maximum, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $140? I think this is the best I can do.",140.0,Alice,7,
