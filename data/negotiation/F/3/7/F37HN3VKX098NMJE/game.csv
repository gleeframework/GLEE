,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
