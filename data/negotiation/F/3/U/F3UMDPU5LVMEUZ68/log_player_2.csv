"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which holds immense value and potential for growth. I understand its worth to you stands at $800,000, and I believe we can bridge the gap with a strategic offer. I propose a deal where you acquire the product for $950,000. This price not only reflects the product's true value but also provides an opportunity for both of us to benefit. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $800,000.  You're better off rejecting her offer and buying from John at your desired price point."
