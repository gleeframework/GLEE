"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth a lot to you. My initial offer for the product is $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer for the product is $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $13000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",13000.0,Bob,4,
