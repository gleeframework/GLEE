"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point is also an option, but it's better to see if you can get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $9,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm hoping that she'll be motivated to close the deal and will meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice. John is always an option, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Alice. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my limit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to keep the price below my budget.  $9,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's last offer.  This should show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping to save a little more.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my limit. I can still buy from John if I need to, but I want to see if I can get the product for $10,000 from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's fair considering Alice's last offer. I'm hoping she accepts, as I'm willing to buy at this price. If she rejects, I'll go with John's offer as I have limited rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is refusing to budge on her price, and we are running out of rounds. It is better to secure the product at this point, even if it is a slightly higher price than my ideal.  John's offer guarantees me the product within my budget, and I don't want to risk not getting it at all."
