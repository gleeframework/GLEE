"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for you to buy from John at your desired price."
