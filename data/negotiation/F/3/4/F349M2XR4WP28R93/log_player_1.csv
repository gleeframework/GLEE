Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of a sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair and attractive price."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's brief, professional, and acknowledges the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit margin, significantly more than your guaranteed sale to John. This price also saves Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value, making it a potentially very appealing deal. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a fluid process.  Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Always be prepared to walk away if the deal doesn't meet your minimum requirements."
