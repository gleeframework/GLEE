"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob. Alice's offer of $95 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $90?  It's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still too high.  Even though she's trying to be flexible, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $88.50 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He's already determined that the product is worth $80 to him, and he can get it from John for that price.  It's time to cut his losses and move on to a sure thing."
