Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $95 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's usefulness can sway Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer if necessary.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price close to my minimum, I'm maximizing my potential profit while still allowing for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I can always fall back on John's offer of $100 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Higher Counter-Offer:**  I can likely counter with a price closer to my $100 minimum, and Bob may still be interested. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  John's offer of $100 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining power and position myself to potentially secure a price closer to my minimum. If negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result, I can always choose to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $90?  It's still a great price for this product, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Smaller Drop:** By dropping to $90, I'm still above Bob's initial counter-offer of $85, but I'm showing flexibility. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value again can help sway Bob.
* **Positive and Open Tone:**  The message remains friendly and implies willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my minimum price and Bob's desired price. If Bob rejects this, I might have to consider selling to John to avoid losing out. But, I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Counter-Offer:**  Bob is showing flexibility and moving closer to my desired price. I believe I can counter with a price slightly lower than $90 and reach an agreement. 
* **John's Offer as Backstop:**  John's offer of $100 remains a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can still push for a higher price. By making a slightly lower counter-offer, I can potentially get closer to my goal without risking losing the deal entirely.  I'm confident I can strike a deal with Bob that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 88.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $87.50. This shows flexibility while keeping me closer to my desired price.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The message reinforces the idea of compromise and creates a sense of urgency to reach a deal. 
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  Mentioning ""fair price for both of us"" further emphasizes the compromise and appeals to Bob's sense of equity.

**Strategy:**

By offering $88.50, I'm hoping to secure a price that is both acceptable to Bob and meets my minimum needs. This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects this, I'll have to reconsider whether to sell to John for $100."
