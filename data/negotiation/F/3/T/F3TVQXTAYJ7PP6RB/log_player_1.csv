Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a price slightly higher.
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product he values, and I secure a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
