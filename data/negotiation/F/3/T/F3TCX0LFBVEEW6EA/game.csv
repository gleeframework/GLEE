"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're still interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference at $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
