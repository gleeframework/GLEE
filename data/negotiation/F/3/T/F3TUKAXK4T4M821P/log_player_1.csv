Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point to maximize my potential profit. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, given his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which might increase his willingness to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know if you're interested."" This leaves room for counteroffers.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I will likely make a new counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing money compared to selling to John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can push for a price closer to my $10,000 target, given Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic bargaining:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my desire for a higher price and may incentivize him to move closer to my desired price point.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial $10,000 offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $9,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'd be willing to consider $9,500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my initial $10,000 and Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm still framing the offer as a ""compromise"" that would benefit both of us. This helps maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by saying, ""Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."" 

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I will sell the product for $9,500.
* **New counteroffer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is only $250 below my desired $9,500. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get closer to my initial price.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price, or even a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Time is money:**  It's more efficient to accept this offer and finalize the sale, rather than risking further delay.

**Next steps:**

* **Finalization:** I will accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale."
