"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in the profit zone.
* **It's below the perceived value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It sets a strong opening:** A bold opening like this can help you secure a better final price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below our desired profit margin. We have 8 rounds left, and the potential for a better deal with Bob.  

We want to see if we can push for a higher price, possibly closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** We are countering Bob's offer with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  We use phrases like ""find a solution"" to encourage further negotiation and a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to our desired price.  While $10,500 isn't our initial target, it's a reasonable compromise. We have already rejected two offers and have only 6 rounds left.  Accepting this offer ensures we make a decent profit and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
