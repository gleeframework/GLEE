Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to try to get a higher price from Bob.  Even if he rejects my counteroffer, I'll still have more rounds to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  I can do $10,750, but that's really pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob. While $10,750 is better than John's offer, I think I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,750 is still a little below what I need.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting stuck at this price.  I'm willing to move a little bit. How about $10,800? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to my target, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's likely Bob won't go higher, and I'm getting close to the point where I'd be better off selling to John."
