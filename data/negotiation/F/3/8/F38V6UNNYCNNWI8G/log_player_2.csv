"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $1,050,000 is a good compromise."
