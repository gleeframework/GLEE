"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me while still being a good deal for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise where we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
