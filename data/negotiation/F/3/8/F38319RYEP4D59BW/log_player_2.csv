"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is better for you:**  $120 is lower than the $150 you'd pay John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** The product is only worth $80 to Alice, so you're getting it for a price that's higher than its value to her, but still lower than your maximum."
