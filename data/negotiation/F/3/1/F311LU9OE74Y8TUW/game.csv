"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $8,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I'm unable to meet the price of $10,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
