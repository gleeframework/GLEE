"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $950,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find an agreement,  $850,000 is below my acceptable range.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value and provides a win-win scenario for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I think $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer of $850,000, which would be $862,500. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to me.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a deal.  However, the lowest I can go is $875,000. This is a firm offer, as I have another buyer ready at a higher price.  It's your final opportunity to secure this product at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
