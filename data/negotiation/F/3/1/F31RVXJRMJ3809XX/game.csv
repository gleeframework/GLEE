"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I've priced it fairly at $1,800,000 considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for some profit for you.  Let's close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,300,000. Let's split the difference - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really hoping we can reach a deal.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. ",1350000.0,Bob,6,
