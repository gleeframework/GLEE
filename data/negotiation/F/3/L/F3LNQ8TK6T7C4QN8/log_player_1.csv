Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is too low for me. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $9,750 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
