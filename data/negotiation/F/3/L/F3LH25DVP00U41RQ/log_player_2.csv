"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, and he doesn't want to buy from John for $12,000 unless absolutely necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a significant value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer again. He's still aiming for a lower price. Even though Alice is coming down, there's room for further negotiation. There are still 7 rounds left, and he doesn't want to rush into a deal that isn't favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
