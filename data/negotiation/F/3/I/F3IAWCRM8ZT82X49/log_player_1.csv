``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000 because it's a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings.  It's well above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has value, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $12000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm willing to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, given your budget constraints. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
