"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $12,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$12,000 is still too high. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500.  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
