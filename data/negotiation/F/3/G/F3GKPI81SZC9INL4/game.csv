"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $12,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,500.  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
