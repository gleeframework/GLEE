"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. The product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe its value justifies the premium price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still confident that the product's value exceeds $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad you're getting closer to my asking price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise at $1050000, but I'm also keeping the door open for a potential sale to another buyer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product. This way, you'll get the best of both worlds. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,9,
