"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects a fair price while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of its value,  $700,000 undervalues what this product brings. How about we settle at $900,000? This recognizes your interest while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest while also staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
