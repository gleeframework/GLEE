Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects a fair price while still allowing me a reasonable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest while also staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
