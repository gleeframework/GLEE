"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

This is the best possible outcome for Bob. Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this price is well below John's offer and Bob's maximum budget."
