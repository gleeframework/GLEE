,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your situation, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",9500.0,Alice,5,
