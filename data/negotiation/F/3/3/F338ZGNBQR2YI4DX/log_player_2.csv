"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a lower price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to pay closer to $105.  This product is worth $120 to me, so I'm already paying a premium.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice is willing to sell it for $110. This is a good deal for Bob.
* **Compromise:** Alice has already moved from $115 to $110, showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
