"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think $11,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value I know you place on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $14,000 to make it worth my while. How about $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,
