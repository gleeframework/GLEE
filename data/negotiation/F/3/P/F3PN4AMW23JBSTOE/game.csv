"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I'm offering it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11250.0,Alice,5,
