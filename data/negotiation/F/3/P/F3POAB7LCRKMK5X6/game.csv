"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $105 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer the product for $90. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $89. It's a bit higher than your last offer but still below my original asking price. This might be the best we can get for now. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
