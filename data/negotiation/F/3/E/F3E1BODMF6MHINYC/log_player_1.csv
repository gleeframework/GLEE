"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value while ensuring I get a decent profit. This strategy is designed to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my initial target. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown interest by making a counteroffer. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial counteroffer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target of $1,450,000.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and keeps the pressure on Bob to make a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  $1,380,000 is still a good profit, but I believe there's room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal closer to my target. I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,400,000, which is the midpoint between my previous counteroffer and Bob's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a high price.  The goal is to get a deal finalized without risking losing Bob to another buyer, especially as we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly below my target, it's only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and continuing to reject could risk losing Bob to another buyer. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit, and I'm confident I can make up for any lost profit in future deals."
