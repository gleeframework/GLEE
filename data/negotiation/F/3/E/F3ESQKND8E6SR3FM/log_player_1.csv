"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This price still reflects the substantial value I see in this product, but it's a more reasonable starting point for further discussion.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."
