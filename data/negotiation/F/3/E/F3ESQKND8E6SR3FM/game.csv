"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This price still reflects the substantial value I see in this product, but it's a more reasonable starting point for further discussion. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,
