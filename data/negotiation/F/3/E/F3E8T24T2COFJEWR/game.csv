"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. However, I do need to inform you that I have other interested parties who are also looking to purchase the product. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've done some further research and have spoken with other interested parties, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $950,000. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I've done some further calculations and have spoken with other interested parties, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
