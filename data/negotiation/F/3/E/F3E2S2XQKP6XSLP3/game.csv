"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's get this deal done.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and my budget. Let's try to find a compromise here. ",925000.0,Bob,6,
