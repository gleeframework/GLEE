"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $125. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that I can still negotiate with Bob and get closer to my target price. I'm willing to take another round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  Let's split the difference. How about $132.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $122.50. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $122.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While continuing to negotiate could potentially get me a better price, there's no guarantee.  I'm confident that I can secure the full value of my product by selling it to John.  I've reached a point where the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward."
