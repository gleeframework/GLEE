"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $650000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $725000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $675000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll make one more counteroffer of $690000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it seriously.",690000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that $690000 is my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to budge any further. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",690000.0,Alice,9,
