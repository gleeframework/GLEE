"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a significant step closer to your price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
