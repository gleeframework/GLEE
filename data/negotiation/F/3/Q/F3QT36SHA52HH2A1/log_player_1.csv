Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit margin. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and ensures a faster transaction.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and having the safety net of John's offer."
