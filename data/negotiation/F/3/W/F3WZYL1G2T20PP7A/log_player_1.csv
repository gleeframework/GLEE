"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but allows room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable price for him while also allowing me to get a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale. $160 is a reasonable price, and it's better than selling to John for $150."
