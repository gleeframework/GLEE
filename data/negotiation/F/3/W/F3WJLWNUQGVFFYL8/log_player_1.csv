{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of him accepting.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll proceed with a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I can't go as low as $120, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm making a counteroffer of $140, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the product's value again to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below that.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
