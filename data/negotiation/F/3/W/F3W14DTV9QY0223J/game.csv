"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,5,
