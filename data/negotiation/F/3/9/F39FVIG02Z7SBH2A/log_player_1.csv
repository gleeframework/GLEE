{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm confident that you will see the potential in it. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This price reflects the significant value I see in the product and the potential benefits it could bring to your business. Of course, I understand this is a significant investment, so please feel free to ask any questions you may have. Let's discuss further to see if this is a good fit for you."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with an ambitious price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the value I place on the product.
* **Message:** The message focuses on:
    * Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.
    * Emphasizing that I believe in the product and its potential for Bob's business.
    * Providing an opportunity for further discussion and questions, allowing Bob to feel comfortable with the offer.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I leave space for negotiation and potential for a higher selling price.
* **Encourage dialogue:** Encouraging questions and discussion allows me to understand Bob's perspective and potentially adjust my offer accordingly.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** The message is friendly and respectful, ensuring a positive interaction even if Bob rejects the offer.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. The final negotiation and price will depend on Bob's response and your willingness to negotiate."
