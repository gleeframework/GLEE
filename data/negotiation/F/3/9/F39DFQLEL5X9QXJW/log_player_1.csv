"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth in today's market."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confidence and Value:** My message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and potential value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high asking price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate but want to avoid appearing overly eager in the early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate.  It's too early to accept his first offer, even if it meets my bottom line. I'll counter in the next round to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I recognize the value you see in the product,  $1,200,000  is below its true market worth. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects its value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:**  Phrases like ""to find a compromise"" and ""acknowledging your interest"" emphasize a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is moving closer to my range, suggesting he's motivated. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant difference from my last offer.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Rejecting keeps the negotiation moving and encourages Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Time Consideration:** I still have several rounds left, allowing me to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a way to close this deal. Would you be willing to consider $1,375,000? This reflects a serious commitment from my end to meet you halfway."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price exactly between our last two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding a strong position.
* **Urgency and Encouragement:** Phrases like ""find a way to close this deal"" and ""serious commitment from my end"" subtly introduce urgency and encourage Bob to finalize the negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are shrinking. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer from this point.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to utilize the funds sooner. Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
