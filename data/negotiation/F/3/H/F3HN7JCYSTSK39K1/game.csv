"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,750,000, which would be $1,475,000. Can we agree on that price?",1475000.0,Bob,4,
