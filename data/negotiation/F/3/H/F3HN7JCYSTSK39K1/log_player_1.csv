Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,750,000, which would be $1,475,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get the full value I place on the product.  It's time to move on."
