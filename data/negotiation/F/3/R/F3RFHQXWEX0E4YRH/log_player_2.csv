"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer at half of Alice's initial price. This is a significant discount and may encourage Alice to negotiate further.  It's also a good starting point, as Bob still has some room to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can still get the product from John for a lower price, so it's better to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $1,250,000. This is still below Alice's offer and closer to his maximum budget. It shows that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet his expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise.  This price is still lower than Alice's latest offer, and is closer to his ideal price point. He's hoping this will convince Alice to accept the deal."
