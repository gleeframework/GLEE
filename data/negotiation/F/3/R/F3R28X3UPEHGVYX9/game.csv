"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $115.  What do you say?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $115.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",115.0,Bob,6,
