Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below what the product is worth to me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000?  This is a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
