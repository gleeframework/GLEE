Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a substantial profit.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to engage with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $950,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $920,000 is a reasonable compromise and a significant improvement on his previous offer. It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John, but continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk him walking away entirely."
