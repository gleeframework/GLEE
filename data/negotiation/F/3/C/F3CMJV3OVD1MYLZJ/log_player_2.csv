Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He has a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is not worth the risk."

This would allow us both to reach a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
