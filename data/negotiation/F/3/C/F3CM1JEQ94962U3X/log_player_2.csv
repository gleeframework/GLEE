"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $12,000. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price point but below the price he would pay to John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He knows Alice's minimum price point is $10,000.  By offering $10,500, Bob is making a reasonable counteroffer that is still lower than Alice's initial offer but significantly higher than Alice's minimum. This gives Alice a chance to negotiate but still allows Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still lower than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice rejected his previous offer of $10,500, but she also raised her price from $12,000 to $12,500. This suggests she's willing to negotiate, but not drastically. By offering $11,000, Bob shows he's serious about getting the product but still wants a better price than Alice's current offer. This is a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, and it's clear she's not willing to come down much further.  At this point, Bob has reached his personal limit. While he could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will budge significantly, and it's more efficient to buy the product from John for a price that's still within Bob's budget,  ensuring he gets the product without further haggling."
