"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the unique nature of the product and its potential value to Bob. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to discussing the price and encourages Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation and a potential deal with Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work towards a more reasonable price. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** The fact that Bob countered with a lower price suggests he's interested in the product. With further negotiation, I might be able to reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a slight risk to potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

This decision allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and explore the possibility of a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but counter-offering with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the unique value of the product to justify my counteroffer and emphasize its worth to Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing my offer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement, creating a sense of collaboration and a path towards a deal. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a constructive dialogue with Bob. 

This strategy aims to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I don't compromise too much on my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is finally above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Outcome:** Accepting this offer means I'll earn $50,000 more than selling to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate further and try to get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further risk.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this stage."
