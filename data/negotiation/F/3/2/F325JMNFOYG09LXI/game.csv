"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product is valuable. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget right now. Would you consider $800,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point that works for me.  How about $880,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I think we are close!  I could make a deal at $900,000.  That would allow me to move forward today.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000 was a bit too low for me, so I'm going to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $900,000. Let's say... $910,000. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",910000.0,Alice,7,
