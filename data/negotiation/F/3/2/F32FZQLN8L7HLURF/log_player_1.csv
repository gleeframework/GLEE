Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures we won't settle for less than $1,500,000. 

This offer aims to start the negotiation at a point advantageous to Alice while still enticing Bob to consider the deal."
