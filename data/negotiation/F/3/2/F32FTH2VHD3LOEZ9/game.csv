"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $130.  It's a fair offer for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $130 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, and I think that's a fair price considering its value.",90.0,Bob,4,
