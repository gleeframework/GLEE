Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $800,000, I believe the product is worth more, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable settling for that amount.  I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $860,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale while still getting a good price for the product.  It's also important to consider the risk of continuing to negotiate. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to negotiate, and I might end up having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
