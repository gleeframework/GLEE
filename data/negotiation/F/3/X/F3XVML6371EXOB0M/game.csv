"Bob, I understand your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm prepared to accept $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm eager to reach a deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $875,000.
