"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects its true value while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room to negotiate.  He can try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $10,750. It's a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be firm on this.  The final offer I can make is $10,900. This is a great deal for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal price:** $10,900 is only $400 more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" indicating there's little room for further bargaining.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects, there's a chance Alice might walk away.  Additionally, buying from John for $12,000 would be significantly more expensive.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic choice.  While not ideal, it secures the product at a price that's relatively close to Bob's budget and minimizes the risk of a better deal slipping away."
