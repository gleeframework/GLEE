Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. By offering it at $115, we're aiming to capture most of the value difference between what Bob is willing to pay and what we're willing to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves some room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants to try for a lower price. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy based on his offer (if any)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $100 and leaves potential profit on the table. We believe we can negotiate a better deal. Bob's willingness to pay more than John indicates the product's value to him. We'll aim for a counteroffer that falls between our desired profit and Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties. It shows we're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:** $110 ensures a profit and capitalizes on the product's higher value to Bob compared to our backup offer from John.
* **Encouraging a Decision:**  By proposing a price closer to his last offer, we nudge Bob towards a decision, as further haggling might not yield significant gains for him."
