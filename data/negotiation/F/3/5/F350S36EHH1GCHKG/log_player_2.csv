Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but the value this product brings to the table is truly substantial.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,950,000? This takes into account the potential benefits you'll reap from it. I'm confident this price reflects a fairer deal for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both find agreeable.  However, $1,950,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 isn't really feasible for me at this time.  If you're able to come down to $900,000, I think we could close this out today."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. It shows you recognize the significant value this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what we're both looking to achieve.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her original price and has declared this her ""final offer.""  It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds to reach your $1,000,000 limit.  You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it makes the most financial sense to take it."
