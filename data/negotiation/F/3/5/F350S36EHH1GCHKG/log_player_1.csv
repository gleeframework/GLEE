Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and offer. While I do see potential value in it, the current price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both find agreeable.  However, $1,950,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 isn't really feasible for me at this time.  If you're able to come down to $900,000, I think we could close this out today.
