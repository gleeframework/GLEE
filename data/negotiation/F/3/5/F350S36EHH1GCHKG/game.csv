"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and offer. While I do see potential value in it, the current price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, but the value this product brings to the table is truly substantial.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,950,000? This takes into account the potential benefits you'll reap from it. I'm confident this price reflects a fairer deal for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price we both find agreeable.  However, $1,950,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 isn't really feasible for me at this time.  If you're able to come down to $900,000, I think we could close this out today.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your candor. I see that we are getting closer. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer on this.  While $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000 to show that I'm serious about getting this deal done today.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. It shows you recognize the significant value this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what we're both looking to achieve.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
