"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. Is this within your budget?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  It's only $25,000 away from your last offer and much closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $925,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to you. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
