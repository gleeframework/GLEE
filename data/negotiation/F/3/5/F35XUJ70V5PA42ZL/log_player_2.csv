# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm confident I can get her closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  It's only $25,000 away from your last offer and much closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $925,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to you. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get the product for a lower price, Alice has clearly set a firm line at $925,000.  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, $925,000 is still within my budget and a better deal than purchasing from John."
