"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I want, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired amount before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, as I mentioned before, but I'm willing to throw in an additional service that I think is worth $250 to you. So, I'm offering $9,000 for the product and an additional $250 in services. That's a total of $9,250, which is the same as your last offer, but I'm providing more value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to hold out for a higher price, the additional $250 worth of services from Bob makes his offer quite appealing. It effectively brings the total value closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for me and avoids the risk of needing to sell to John at a lower price."
