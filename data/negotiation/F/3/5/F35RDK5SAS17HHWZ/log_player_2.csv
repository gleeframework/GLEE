"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $135 is still too high for Bob, as the product is worth $150 to him.
* **Option 3:** Buying from John for $150 is the baseline. There's always the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails.
* **Next Steps:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible, while still being reasonable.
* **Alice's offer:**  $135 is still too high.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $125 is a good starting point. It's still above Alice's value of $120, making it potentially acceptable.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  This offer shows Bob is willing to negotiate and could lead to a compromise in the next rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.

* **Option 3:**  Buying from John for $150 is still a viable option if negotiations fail.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Continue to negotiate and get a better price.
* **Alice's offer:** $140 is still too high, but we're getting closer. 
* **Counteroffer:** $130 is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer should put more pressure on Alice to either accept or make a more reasonable counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $145 is higher than the price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Option 3:**  Buying from John for $150 is the best option at this point. This ensures Bob gets the product without overpaying.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** The negotiation seems to be going nowhere. Alice is not willing to go lower than $145, and Bob is not willing to pay more than $130. 

**Conclusion:**  By buying from John, Bob secures the product while avoiding further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
