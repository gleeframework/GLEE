"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is substantial, and $1,100,000 significantly undervalues it.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
