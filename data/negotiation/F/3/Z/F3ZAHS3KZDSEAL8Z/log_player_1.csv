{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum but high enough to potentially entice Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought, and while I appreciate the effort, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $11,000. My budget constraints are quite tight, and I'm looking for something closer to $10,000. Would it be possible for us to come to an agreement around that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, which is significantly below your minimum.  Given John is willing to pay your minimum, it makes more sense to sell to John and ensure a fair price for the product."
