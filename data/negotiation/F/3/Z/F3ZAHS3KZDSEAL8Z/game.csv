"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought, and while I appreciate the effort, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $11,000. My budget constraints are quite tight, and I'm looking for something closer to $10,000. Would it be possible for us to come to an agreement around that price point?",10000.0,Bob,4,
