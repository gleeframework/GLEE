"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I'm very interested in the product and think this would be a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $82 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $78?  I think that's a fair price that we can both agree on.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
