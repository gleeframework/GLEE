"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my willingness to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
