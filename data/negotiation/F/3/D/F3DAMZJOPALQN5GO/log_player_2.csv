# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it's worth noting that this product has a significant personal value to me, but I am confident it holds even greater potential for you. Considering its immense worth to you, I propose a fair transaction price of $12,000. This offer aims to provide you with substantial savings while ensuring a fair return for my investment. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to discuss how this product can contribute to your success. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
