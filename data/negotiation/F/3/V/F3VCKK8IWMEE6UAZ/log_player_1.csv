Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I have 10 rounds to reach a deal and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
