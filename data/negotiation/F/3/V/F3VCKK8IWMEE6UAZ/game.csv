,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1250000?  This price allows for a fair profit for me and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1250000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal before I have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
