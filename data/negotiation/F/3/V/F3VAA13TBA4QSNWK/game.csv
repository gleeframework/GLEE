"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your need to profit, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is the final price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
