"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $22000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $19500?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $19500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $20000? I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the extras you're offering. What do you think?",19000.0,Bob,6,
