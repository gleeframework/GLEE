"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We're starting with an offer significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a very favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business, we're anchoring the price to its worth rather than just throwing out a number.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used (""initially proposing,"" ""starting point"") signals to Bob that we are open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount, so there's likely room to push for a higher price. We'll reject this offer to signal that we believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand budget considerations. However, the value this product brings to your specific operations is substantial. I could consider parting with it for $1,275,000. This offer reflects a willingness to meet you halfway while still recognizing the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession by coming down $25,000, which should signal our willingness to negotiate, but not too aggressively.
* **Reiterating Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's unique value to *his* business, subtly anchoring the price to its potential benefits rather than just a number.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The language suggests a firm stance while still leaving room for further discussion.  We're aiming for a collaborative approach to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am unable to meet your current proposal. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,250,000 is a very strong offer. It's a significant profit above our minimum and shows Bob is serious.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. There's a risk Bob could walk away or we could waste valuable time.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting now allows us to move on to other potential deals and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling completely. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the time and effort involved likely wouldn't outweigh the relatively small increase in profit. Accepting this offer is a strategic win."
