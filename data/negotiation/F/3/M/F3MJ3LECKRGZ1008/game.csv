"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $13,000 is closer to my valuation, I still feel that we could reach a better agreement.
