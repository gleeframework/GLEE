"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. However,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
