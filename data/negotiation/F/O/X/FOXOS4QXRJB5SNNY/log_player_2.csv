"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**  
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's ample opportunity to try and get a better price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,500 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a lower offer:** I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, aiming to establish a negotiating range.
* **Staying within your budget:** $12,500 is within your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for some bargaining as you have several rounds to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down a little, though. I'd accept $13,500. That gives you a good price and still allows me to get a reasonable return. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.**  You're aiming for a lower price, ideally closer to $12,500.
* **You still have 7 rounds left.**  This gives you enough time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you the opportunity to counteroffer again.** You can try to bridge the gap between your current offer and Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  While $13,500 is closer, I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This offer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still staying within your comfort zone.
* **Reasonable price:**  $13,000 is a good deal for you as it's well below your maximum budget, and it's also a fair price for Alice as she's willing to sell for $12,000.
* **Signaling willingness to close:** The message emphasizes your readiness to close the deal at this price, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
