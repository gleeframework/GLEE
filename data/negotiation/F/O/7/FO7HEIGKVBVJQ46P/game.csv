,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $97.50 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $95. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $92.50. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $94. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",94.0,Alice,7,
