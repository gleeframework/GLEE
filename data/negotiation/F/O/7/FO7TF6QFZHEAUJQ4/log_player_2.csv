"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we believe it's worth $800000 to you. Would you be interested in discussing this offer further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds, you have room to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price a bit, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing but would need to start at $700,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a significant discount from Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge Alice's flexibility. It demonstrates your interest while establishing a lower starting point for negotiations. The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $750000. This is our best offer, considering the value of the product to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good deal for Bob, considering his initial budget of $800,000.  While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a higher price or the need to buy from John at his full price."
