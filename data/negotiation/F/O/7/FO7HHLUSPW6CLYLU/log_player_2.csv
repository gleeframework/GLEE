"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $1,150,000 from Alice, and he can always go to John if he needs to. This keeps Bob in a position of power to potentially negotiate a better deal."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than the initial offer,  Bob is still hoping to get the product for less. He can still make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower. If not, he can always buy from John."
