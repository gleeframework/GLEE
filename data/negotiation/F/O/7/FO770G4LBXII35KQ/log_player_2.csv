"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her own valuation, it's still more than you need to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best way to achieve your goal of saving money."
