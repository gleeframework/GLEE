Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she needs to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below that will be instantly accepted.  Alice needs to go higher.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly pressures Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

**The Offer:**  $1,150,000 is a strong opening offer. It gives Bob a substantial discount ($50,000) compared to what John is willing to pay, making it an attractive proposition.  

**Important Note:** If Bob counters, Alice can then decide to negotiate further or accept John's offer, knowing she secured the best possible outcome."
