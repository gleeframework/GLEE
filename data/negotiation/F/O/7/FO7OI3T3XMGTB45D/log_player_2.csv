"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your budget of $12,000. It's not worth accepting.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate a better price, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and it leaves no room for further negotiation. It's a bold move, but it establishes my boundaries early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $16,000 is still above my budget. It's not worth accepting yet. I have more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and sending a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firmly within my budget.  It's a reasonable middle ground to explore before potentially moving closer to my final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, and I'm not going to settle for anything significantly more. I have five more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and sending a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $13,500. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's closer to her last offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. With four rounds remaining, I'm cautiously optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still above my budget. I have three rounds left, and I'm determined to get the price down to $12,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and sending another counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $13,750. This is a significant move towards Alice's last offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for compromise.  With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a compelling offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the final round of negotiations. While Alice's offer of $13,800 is the closest to my budget so far, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I've made several counteroffers and I'm not confident that Alice will come down to my target price of $12,000 in this final round.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
