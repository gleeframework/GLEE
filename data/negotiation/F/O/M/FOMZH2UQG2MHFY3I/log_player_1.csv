Round 2

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  He's set a firm limit and we've been gradually moving towards John's offer. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $125,000.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the sure deal with John."
