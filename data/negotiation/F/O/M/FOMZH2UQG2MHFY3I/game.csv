"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle – how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is still under what I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. Let's consider $1,550,000 – it's a competitive price that reflects the true worth of this product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price point doesn't quite reflect the value of what's being offered. Let's land this at $1,450,000 and seal the deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can go up to $1,375,000, but that's my limit.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
