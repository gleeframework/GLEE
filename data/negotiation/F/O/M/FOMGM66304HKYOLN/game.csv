"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
