"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $125? I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're serious about buying the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet at $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my minimum price.",135.0,Alice,5,
