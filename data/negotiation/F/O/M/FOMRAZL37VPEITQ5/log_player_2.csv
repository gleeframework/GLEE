"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's always the option to buy from John, so there's no risk in rejecting Alice's initial offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I have in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and the possibility of buying from John for a lower price incentivizes Bob to keep trying."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,020,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly represents the product's value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,020,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's tempting to take the deal, Bob has a lower option available with John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price or secure the product from John for a significantly lower price."
