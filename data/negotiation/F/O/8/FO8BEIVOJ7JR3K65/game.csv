"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your own desire to make a sale.  Let's meet in the middle and find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
