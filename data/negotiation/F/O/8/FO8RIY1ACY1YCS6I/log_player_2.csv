"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. How about $125? It's a steal considering what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than $150, you can still do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $100. There's room for negotiation to get a lower price."
