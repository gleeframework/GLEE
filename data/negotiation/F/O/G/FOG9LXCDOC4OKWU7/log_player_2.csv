"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely reject and counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that you're serious about buying. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important. The message acknowledges her offer and expresses your interest, even while countering.
* **Strategic:** This counteroffer aims to understand Alice's bottom line and how flexible she might be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your budget, $9,000 is still above what you're willing to pay. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes sense to counter-offer one more time and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $7,500? I'm ready to make a deal if this price works for you."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts you just below your walk-away price ($8,000 from John) and significantly below Alice's current offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Phrasing like ""ready to make a deal"" might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer likely determines if a deal can be made with Alice or if it's time to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $8,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $8,500 is her bottom line. Since you can get the product from John for $8,000, it's no longer worth negotiating with Alice. You've reached a point where accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying."
