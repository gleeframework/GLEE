"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would give us both a solid deal, and I'm confident this product would be a great addition to my business.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
