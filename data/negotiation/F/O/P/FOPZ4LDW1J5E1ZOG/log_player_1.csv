Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $875,000? This would allow you to make a substantial profit while giving me a good deal.  Let's make this happen.
