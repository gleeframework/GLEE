"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit and allows us both to get a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000? This allows me to get a fair return while still offering you a great price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $875,000? This would allow you to make a substantial profit while giving me a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to achieve a certain return on this product.",885000.0,Alice,5,
