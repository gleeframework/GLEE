Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting at $12,000, I can potentially negotiate down to a price that is still acceptable to me while leaving Bob feeling like he got a good deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds of negotiation. I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, which acts as a safety net and ensures I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly below that. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary. This puts me in a stronger position during further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm making a moderate counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Offering a Compromise:** By lowering the price from my initial offer, I demonstrate flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, which gives me a safety net and reinforces my position in the negotiation."
