Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own a truly unique product.  Its value to you is considerable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While aiming high, Alice doesn't want to start at $1,200,000. This could make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation and walk away. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Alice could choose a more aggressive opening price, especially if she's skilled in negotiation and believes Bob is very eager to acquire the product."
