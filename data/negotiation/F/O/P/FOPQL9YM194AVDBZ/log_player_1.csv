Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $91. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and I'm getting close to the end of our rounds. There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he'll either drop out or we won't be able to reach a deal before I have to sell to John for $100."
