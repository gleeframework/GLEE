"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not a viable price for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a decent deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $900,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step for me.  This price is fair considering the value to me and allows you to make a profit.  Let's close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this sale.",975000.0,Alice,7,
