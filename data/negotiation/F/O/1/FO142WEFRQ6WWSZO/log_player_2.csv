Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's finalize this sale.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to my budget, but it's still a bit over what I'm comfortable with. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down further. Rather than continuing to negotiate, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed deal that fits my budget and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
