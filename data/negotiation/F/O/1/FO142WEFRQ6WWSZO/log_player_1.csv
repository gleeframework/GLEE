"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is way too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply not a viable price for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
