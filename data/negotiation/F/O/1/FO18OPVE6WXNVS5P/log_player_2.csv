Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $102, but I need a bit more. I'm going to take a small step up to $110, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has circled back to her original offer of $110 and is firmly stating this is her minimum.  She is unlikely to go any lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $120. You'll be paying a slight premium, but further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to yield a better outcome."
