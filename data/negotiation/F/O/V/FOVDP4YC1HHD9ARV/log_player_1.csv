Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:** $115 is higher than the $100 you'd get from John, ensuring you make more money if Bob accepts.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** $115 is still lower than the $120 Bob values the product at, meaning he has a potential gain from purchasing it. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still being appealing to Bob."
