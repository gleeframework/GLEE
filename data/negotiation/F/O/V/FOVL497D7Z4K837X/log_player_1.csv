"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential range."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's a good middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, while still allowing me to make a profit above my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This shows my continued willingness to negotiate, and it's a  further compromise towards Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot that gets us both to agree."

Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also significantly higher than what John is offering. With only four rounds remaining, I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure I get a good price and finalize the deal."
