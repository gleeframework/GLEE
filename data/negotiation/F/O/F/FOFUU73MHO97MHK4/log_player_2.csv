"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value of the product ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000). 
* You have a higher budget than Alice's offer, so there's room for negotiation.
* You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is  significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This recognizes the value while allowing me a fair return on my investment.
