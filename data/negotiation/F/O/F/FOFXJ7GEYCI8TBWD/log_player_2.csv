"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no reason to try and negotiate further, as you're already getting the product for the price you're willing to pay.  Buying from John would be the same price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most efficient choice."
