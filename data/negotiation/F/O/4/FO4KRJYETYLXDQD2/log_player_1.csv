Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my absolute minimum price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message invites Bob to share his thoughts, implying I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that's profitable for me while still enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm prepared to negotiate down slightly if needed, knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
