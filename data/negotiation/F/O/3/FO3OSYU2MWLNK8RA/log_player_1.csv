"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential value for Bob.  It avoids stating your minimum price to maintain leverage. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, you establish a baseline and give yourself room to negotiate down if needed. This also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $8,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiating, $8,500 is not a good deal for me. I will reject his offer and try to secure a higher price in the next round.  I still have many rounds left and can potentially secure a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're the only interested buyer right now. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $10,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's perceived value, giving me some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my minimum acceptable price. I emphasize the ""fairness"" of my counteroffer while subtly highlighting the limited competition to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to strike a balance between being firm on my price and showing flexibility to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great product at a price I can afford. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, especially since I'm not under immediate pressure to sell. With 6 rounds remaining, I believe I can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,500 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price while reiterating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:**  With limited rounds remaining, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency, but not pressure, by showing I'm willing to meet halfway while maintaining a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $9,250? This would be a great compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I believe it's a good time to close the deal.  

While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely, or me having to sell to John at a lower price in the future.  

Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, maximizing my earnings in this scenario."
