**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price.  There's still room for both parties to reach a mutually agreeable price."
