"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a solid profit while securing a good deal for my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
