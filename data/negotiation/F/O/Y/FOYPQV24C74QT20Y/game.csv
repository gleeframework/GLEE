"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm firm on my maximum offer of $8,000.  If you're not able to reach that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your maximum offer of $8,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $9,000 as my final offer. I understand you're not willing to go lower than $10,000, but I hope we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
