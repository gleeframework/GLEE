"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him consider the offer.
* **Openness:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion with a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  There's still time to negotiate and I can likely secure a higher price by continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while protecting my interests.
* **Re-emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chance of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet ready to settle at $725,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still below what this product is truly worth to you.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a solid return on your investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his latest offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to him and emphasizing the potential return on investment. 
* **Direct and clear:** My message is concise and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm subtly increasing the pressure by suggesting a final offer, hinting that we are getting close to a decision point."
