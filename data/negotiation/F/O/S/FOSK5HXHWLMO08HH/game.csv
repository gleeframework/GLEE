"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still below what this product is truly worth to you.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a solid return on your investment. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
