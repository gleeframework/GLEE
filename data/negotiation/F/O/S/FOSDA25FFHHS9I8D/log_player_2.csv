Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the highest price you're willing to pay. I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000, as it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, so I'll offer you $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge below $1,100,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your maximum price.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
