While it's not ideal to go so far below the initial asking price, Bob is holding firm and we're getting into the territory where the difference between his offer and John's standing offer is quite small. Taking the $13,500 now avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely and getting stuck with the $12,000 offer from John."
