"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
