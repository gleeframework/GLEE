This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between the last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price."
