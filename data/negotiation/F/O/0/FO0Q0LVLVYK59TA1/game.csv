"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,600,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product goes beyond that. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and its potential for a substantial return.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's potential, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
