Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
