"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value our potential partnership,  $900,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
