"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could meet you halfway at $8,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
