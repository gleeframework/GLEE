Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise.  It's better than selling to John and I'm confident we can establish a positive relationship for future deals."
