"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit more than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, I've already spent three rounds negotiating, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher.  Rather than continue to negotiate and potentially waste more time, it's more efficient to accept John's offer and sell the product for $100."
