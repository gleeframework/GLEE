"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, so I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal work.  This reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $12000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
