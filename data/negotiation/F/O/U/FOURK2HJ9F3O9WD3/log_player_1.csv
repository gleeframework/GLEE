Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth, so I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($10,000) but still within a range that might be attractive to Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth and potential benefits to Bob to make him more interested.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price is high enough to allow for some negotiation if needed, without compromising my minimum goal. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer that's below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:**  Bob's offer is at my minimum price, which is acceptable but not ideal. I'd prefer to earn more if possible. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Since Bob is interested and willing to negotiate, I believe there's room for me to get a better price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale:** Selling to John now guarantees me $10,000, but I might be able to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $10,000, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this deal work.  This reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm explaining the price by referencing the product's value, making it more likely for Bob to see it as reasonable.
* **Maintaining Incentive:** $12,000 is still above my minimum, so I'm not sacrificing too much while keeping the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or go to John, considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $12000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum, which is a good compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only the $10,000 offer from John. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing negotiations could take longer and potentially lead to a lower offer or no deal at all. 

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer at $11,000 is the most sensible choice given the potential risks and my desire to close the deal."
