"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, but not astronomically high. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the ""unique"" and ""great value"" aspects of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended:** The message leaves room for Bob to ask questions and potentially express interest. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a high-risk strategy as I'm starting with a price much higher than my minimum.  
* I'm relying on Bob's perceived value of the product being higher than $1,000,000 to incentivize a deal. 
* I will need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can use Bob's interest as leverage to try and push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm confident I can do better with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial asking price, explaining my rationale and emphasizing the value proposition of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this unique product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer and meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a decent profit.
* **Reasoning:** I justify my counteroffer by re-emphasizing the unique value of the product, reinforcing that my offer is fair.
* **Open-Ended:** I leave the door open for further discussion and negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual approach, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my minimum price. I will continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming for a deal that maximizes my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds left, there's a risk of Bob's interest waning, or of me not being able to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer a higher price, the potential for further negotiation is limited. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent profit and minimizes the risk of a deal falling through.

**Next Steps:**

Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'll keep in mind that I'm close to my minimum.  If any future opportunities arise, I'll be open to exploring those."
