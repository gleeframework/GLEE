"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for the negotiation and gives me room to maneuver if Bob counters.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to maximize potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up in price.  I'll use the next round to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is still above my minimum threshold and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, especially since he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm aware that I could sell to John now for $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm also hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, it will encourage Bob to come up to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold and I'm running out of time. John's offer guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
