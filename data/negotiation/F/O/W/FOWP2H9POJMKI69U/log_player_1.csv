Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price point where both parties feel like they got a good deal.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($10,000) increases the chance of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome for Alice."
