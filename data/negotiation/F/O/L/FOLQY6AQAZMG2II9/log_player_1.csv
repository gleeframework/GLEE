"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is better than $150, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my initial asking price, and I'm not in a rush to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I believe $175 is a fair price, considering the product is worth $150 to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $165.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm aware that we're running out of rounds.  $165 is a good profit margin, and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
