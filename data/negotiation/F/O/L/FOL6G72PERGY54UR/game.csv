"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $10,200? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope it's a price you're comfortable with. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,4,
