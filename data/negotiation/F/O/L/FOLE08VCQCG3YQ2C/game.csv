"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down to $1200000.  This reflects the product's true value and would still be a profitable deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
