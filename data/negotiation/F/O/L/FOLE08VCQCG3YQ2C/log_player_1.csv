Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a truly unique product.  I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by stating ""Let me know your thoughts"". 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Product Value:**  I'm assuming the product is truly worth $1,000,000 or more to me. If it's not, this strategy might not be the best.
* **Bob's Knowledge:** I don't know Bob's knowledge or interest in the product. A higher starting price could scare him off.
* **Negotiation Skills:** I'll need to be prepared to counter-offer and negotiate strategically if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates strong interest in the product. This suggests there's potential for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my target but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's true value and would still be a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the proposed price is a ""profitable deal for both of us."" This encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by stating ""I'm willing to negotiate."" This avoids a stalemate and keeps the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  Bob's budget constraints are evident.
* **Secure the Minimum:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safe and efficient solution."
