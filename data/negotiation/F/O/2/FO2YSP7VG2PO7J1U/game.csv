"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm confident that we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1050000. This price takes into account your research and the market value, while still recognizing the product's unique features and benefits. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident we can work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1050000 is a bit steep. I've done some more research and I believe the product's value is closer to what I initially offered. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be within my budget. I'm offering $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, taking into account your research and budget constraints. I'm offering $1025000 for the product. This price is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your potential return on investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've done some more research and I'm convinced that the product's value is closer to what I initially thought.

"Alice, I've made a serious effort to compromise and meet you halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $980000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, taking into account your budget constraints. I'm offering $1030000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
