Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,500,000 in the right hands. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** I start with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to set a strong anchor. This makes the final offer seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the product's high value to him, justifying the price and creating a sense of urgency.
* **Limited Time:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and reduces the chance of him negotiating further.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my offer is closer to Bob's perceived value, I'm still leaving some room for potential negotiation if he counters.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
