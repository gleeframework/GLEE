"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  It's  significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to achieve a strong profit. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's a significant profit for you, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
