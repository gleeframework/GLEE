{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product, which might make Bob more willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll consider making a new counteroffer or selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob is showing interest and is willing to pay more than his estimated value of $80. This means there's potential for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $90 and my desired price of $100. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer (splitting the difference) to make it seem logical and fair. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I'll finalize the sale.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We're now several rounds into the negotiation, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a stalemate. 
* **John is a secure option:**  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome and eliminates the risk of continuing a negotiation that might not lead to a favorable result.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, but I will also consider selling to John if Bob rejects my final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, and offer you the product for $94. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and might push Bob to accept. 
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, reducing my price by $1 from my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still staying close to my minimum.
* **Alternative:** I'm mentioning that I have other buyers to make Bob aware that he's not the only option.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal.
* If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $100."
