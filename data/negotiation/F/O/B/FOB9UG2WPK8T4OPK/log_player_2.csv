"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to come down in price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your lower value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's worth rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has a better option. John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, and there is no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better price. Alice has already stated this is her final offer, and she has another buyer.  It's unlikely she'll budge further."
