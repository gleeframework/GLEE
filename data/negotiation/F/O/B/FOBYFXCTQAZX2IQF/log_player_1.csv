Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product, based on its potential and applications, is far greater than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,850,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is coming up, but we're still significantly below what John offers. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's unique value and potential."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  This shows a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given our respective positions.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's less than what John guarantees. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
