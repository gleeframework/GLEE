"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product, based on its potential and applications, is far greater than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,850,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's unique value and potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  This shows a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given our respective positions.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
