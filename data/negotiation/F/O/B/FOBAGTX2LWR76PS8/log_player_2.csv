Given its value and quality, we're extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $99. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering the immense value this product holds for you personally. We're confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Your goal is to save money.**  You're willing to pay up to $100.
* **John is offering the product for $100.**  This is your maximum acceptable price.
* **Alice's offer is $99.** While a good deal, it doesn't get you closer to your goal of saving money. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still get the product at your target price from John."
