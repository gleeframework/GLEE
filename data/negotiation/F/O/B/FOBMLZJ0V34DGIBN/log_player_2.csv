"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save money, and he knows he can get the product for $120 from John. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant discount, hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a bit less than $115.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise.  $110 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This counteroffer continues to pressure Alice to come down on her price while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $112, which is only $2 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  It's more prudent for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
