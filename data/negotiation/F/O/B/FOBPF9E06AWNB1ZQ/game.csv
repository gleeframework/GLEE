"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness and value of it. However, my budget is quite limited. Would you consider selling it to me for $10000? I believe it's a fair price given the current market conditions.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the gesture. However, I still feel that $14000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a price of $12000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet the price of $13500. I would like to propose a price of $13000. I hope this is within the range you're willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,6,
