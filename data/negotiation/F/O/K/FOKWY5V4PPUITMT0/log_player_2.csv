"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you.  My asking price is $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to discussing your perspective. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite in the range I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
