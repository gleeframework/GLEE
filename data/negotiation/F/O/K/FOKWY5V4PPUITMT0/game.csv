"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you.  My asking price is $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also open to discussing your perspective. Let's talk.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite in the range I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
