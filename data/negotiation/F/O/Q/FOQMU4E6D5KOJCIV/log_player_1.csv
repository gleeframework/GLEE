Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the current market.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Initial Price:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also reinforces the idea that the product is valuable. 
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no pressure to accept anything less.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some flexibility and are willing to negotiate with Bob. If Bob outright rejects the offer, you can always lower the price or move on to John."
