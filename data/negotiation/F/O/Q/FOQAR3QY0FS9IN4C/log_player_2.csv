"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000.  This product is worth that to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his own valuation as possible. This counteroffer is a strong starting point, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still likely get a better deal. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but is being realistic. He's offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
