"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $12,000.",10800.0,Alice,5,
