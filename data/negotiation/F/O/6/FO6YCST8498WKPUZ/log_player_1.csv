Even though it's only a $4 difference, we're still aiming to get as much as possible. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I want to be fair, but I can't go as low as $82. How about we split the difference and settle on $85?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $85. Would $81 be a price you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and getting $81 is better than John's standing offer of $80. It's time to accept."
