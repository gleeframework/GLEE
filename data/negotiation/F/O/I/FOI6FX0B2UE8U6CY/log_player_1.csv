Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your floor price of $10,000.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off immediately with an unrealistic price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price gives you space to lower the price if needed.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest possible price while still ensuring a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than the floor price of $10,000, you can likely still get a higher price. You're still in the negotiation phase and can try to secure a price closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Remaining firm but flexible:** You're still holding firm on your desired price but are showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Open communication:** The message emphasizes your appreciation for Bob's interest and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has come up to $13,000. This is only $500 less than your previous counteroffer, and is significantly higher than your floor price of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, especially since John is a guaranteed $10,000 sale.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy to maximize your earnings."
