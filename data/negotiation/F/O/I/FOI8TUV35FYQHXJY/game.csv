"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a great opportunity to get the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",815000.0,Alice,5,
