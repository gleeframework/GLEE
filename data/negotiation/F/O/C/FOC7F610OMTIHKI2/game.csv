"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",14000.0,Bob,4,
