"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your position. I would like to propose a price of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price. Selling to John at this point would leave a lot of potential profit on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This leaves some room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $1325000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not where I want it to be.  With 6 rounds left, there's still time to potentially get a better deal.  Selling to John now would mean losing out on a chance to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  However, $1,325,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,337,500. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1337500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate. I believe there's still room for a higher price, especially considering Bob's demonstrated willingness to negotiate. Selling to John now would mean losing out on potentially earning more."
