"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond the $800,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
