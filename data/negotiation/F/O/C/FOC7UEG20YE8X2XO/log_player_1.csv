I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves a good margin for negotiation, but also shows I'm serious about getting a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$12,000 is still too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable amount."
