"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have room to maneuver before you need to buy from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum selling price. This provides a starting point for negotiation, aiming for a price that is both within your budget and acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or further lowering the price to a point where it becomes unattractive for me is present.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
