Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This price is likely too high for Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price gradually, while still securing a profit above my minimum of $1,500,000. I also have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a slightly lower price, potentially enticing him to accept while still getting closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation. Hopefully, this price will be appealing to Bob while still securing a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from him. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
