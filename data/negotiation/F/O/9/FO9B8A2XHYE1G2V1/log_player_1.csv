{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but it also leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than what it's worth to him.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
