"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could we agree on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
