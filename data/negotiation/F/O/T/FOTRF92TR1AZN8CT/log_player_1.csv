Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3

I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? It's still a significant discount for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more wiggle room.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a significant gap from where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see $1,275,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1,225,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more flexibility. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not reaching my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions and don't want to risk losing a significant amount of money. Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures I get the best possible deal and avoids further potential losses."
