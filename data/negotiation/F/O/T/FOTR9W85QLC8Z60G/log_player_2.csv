"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm and agree that this product is great. However, $750,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let me know your thoughts on this."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially leading to a higher price or stalemate means it's more advantageous to accept her offer and secure the product."
