"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my valuable product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as you know its worth to you is $1,500,000. Consider this a chance to secure an asset that will benefit you greatly. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, the goal is to save as much money as possible, even if it means a slightly lower profit margin. 
* Rejecting the offer and buying from John would be a worse financial decision."
