"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential ROI for your specific needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
