"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while gauging Bob's interest level.  
* **Confident Language:**  Framing the offer with positive and value-oriented language can encourage Bob to see the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies a willingness to discuss the price, indicating I'm flexible and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate and will try to guide him closer to at least $1,500,000. Selling to John right now would meet my minimum, but I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and its potential ROI for your specific needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Validating:** I start by showing Bob I've considered his offer and understand his viewpoint. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the product's potential benefits specifically for Bob, subtly reminding him why it's worth a higher investment.
* **Significant Concession (Meeting Halfway):** By dropping $250,000, I demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This substantial move might encourage Bob to make a more significant counteroffer in return.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $1,750,000 price point keeps me above my minimum while still allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
