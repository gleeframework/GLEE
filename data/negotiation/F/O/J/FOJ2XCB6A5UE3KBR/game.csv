"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9900.0,Bob,4,
