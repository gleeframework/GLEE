Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While Bob's value is lower, this opens the negotiation with a strong position.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the value, even if his perceived value is lower.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob is savvy, he'll try to negotiate down from $1,300,000, giving you room to still secure a price significantly above his $800,000 valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, giving you a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the offer."
