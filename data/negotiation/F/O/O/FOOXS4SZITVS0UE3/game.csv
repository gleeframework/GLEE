"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $9,000, but I'm afraid that's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer of $10,000, but I'd like to add some value to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a free upgrade to our premium support package, which is worth $1,000. So, I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This way, you'll get the product and the premium support for a great price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer with the premium support, but I'm really focused on the base price.  How about we settle at $10,500 and I can consider the premium support separately later?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still focused on the base price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,500, so I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
