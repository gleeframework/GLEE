"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product might be worth more than he initially thinks, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob's engagement and understand his perspective. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his message suggests he's interested, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, either with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and his budget limitations, showing him that I respect his position. 
* **Standing Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm making it clear that $1,000,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the product's value.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a significant price reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer.

By taking this approach, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while still pushing for a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, his increments are too small to reach an acceptable agreement within a reasonable timeframe. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about a higher price and increase the urgency for him to propose something more substantial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. If you can meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning John's offer. This highlights the opportunity cost for Bob if he doesn't reach an agreement soon.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm serious about the price and unlikely to negotiate further.
* **Significant Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession by dropping to $1,400,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffers. This shows flexibility while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Call to Action:**  The offer is framed as a clear decision point for Bob, encouraging him to make a decisive move if he's genuinely interested. 

This strategy aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob quickly or prompt him to walk away, allowing me to proceed with John's offer."
