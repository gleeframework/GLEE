Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $1,050,000 would be a more comfortable starting point for negotiations.  I believe that reflects the value I place on it while still being a fair offer for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
