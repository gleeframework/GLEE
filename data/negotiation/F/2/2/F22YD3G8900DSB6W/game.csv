"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $1,050,000 would be a more comfortable starting point for negotiations.  I believe that reflects the value I place on it while still being a fair offer for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the move towards my price point.  To be completely candid, I have a firm budget in mind. I can offer you $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting an offer that's below my initial target price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $1,225,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
