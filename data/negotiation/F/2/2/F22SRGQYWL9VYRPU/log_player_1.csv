Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $987,500. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $987,500 is still a bit too much.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $968,750.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $968,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $968,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's more favorable to me. While his offer of $968,750 is tempting, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to see if he'll go higher in the next round, as we're still a reasonable distance from my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While your last offer was close, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $978,000? It's a small adjustment, but it would help me feel comfortable closing the deal."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $978,000 is still just outside my comfort zone.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $968,750.  This seems like a fair compromise that would allow us both to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $968,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $968,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now anchored his offer twice at $968,750.  This suggests he's reaching his upper limit. While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is becoming less significant, and there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
