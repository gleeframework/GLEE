"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 is still significantly lower than the value I believe the product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits the product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
