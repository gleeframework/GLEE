"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13250. It's a fair compromise and still allows me to get a good price for the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13250. How about we meet in the middle at $12750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still not there yet. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $13000.  It's a good deal for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while still offering you a great product at a competitive price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
