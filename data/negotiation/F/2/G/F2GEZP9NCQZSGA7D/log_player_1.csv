Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $150 from John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is a good starting point. It's below your maximum price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is polite, direct, and clearly states the price."
