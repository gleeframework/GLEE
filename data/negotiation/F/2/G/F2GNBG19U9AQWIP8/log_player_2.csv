"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may differ. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get closer to his $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also wants a better deal. $85 is closer to his target and still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussion, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm now willing to consider $90 for the product. Let me know if this aligns better with your expectations! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $90 is closer to his target, he can likely get it down further.  Rejecting allows him to counter again and hopefully get closer to his $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87, which is fair to both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price with each counteroffer. $87 is a reasonable compromise that leaves room for Alice to negotiate but still saves Bob some money.  This demonstrates Bob's commitment to buying the product while pushing for a better price."
