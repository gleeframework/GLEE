Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,500? I think this price is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with that amount. I'll try to counter with a higher price and see if we can come to an agreement."
