"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This price is still very beneficial to you, given the product's value to your company, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle again and try $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
