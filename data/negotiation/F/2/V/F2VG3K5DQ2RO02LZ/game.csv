"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to gain a substantial advantage. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for you to profit significantly, and it's a fair price given the product's potential. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I believe in the product's potential, I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still not quite there yet. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within your budget. I'm confident this is a fair offer that will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
