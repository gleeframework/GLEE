Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise closer to my minimum value. Hopefully, this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a good price. I will counteroffer again hoping to get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115 this time. It's a small compromise from my last offer, but hopefully, it's enough to get Bob to agree. I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell and John's offer is becoming more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations seem to be getting nowhere.  While I'm only $5 away from my minimum price,  I'm not sure if I can push Bob further.  At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
