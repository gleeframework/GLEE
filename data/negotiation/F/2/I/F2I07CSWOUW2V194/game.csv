"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $105?  That's still a fair price for the product, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I am willing to consider your offer of $105. However, I need to ensure that we both arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I propose a price of $106 for the product. This slightly exceeds your offer while still being reasonable considering the value provided by the product. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",106.0,Alice,3,
