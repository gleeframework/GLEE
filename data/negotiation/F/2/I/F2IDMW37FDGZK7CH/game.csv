"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we settle at $12,500?  That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still working for me. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's a good compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
