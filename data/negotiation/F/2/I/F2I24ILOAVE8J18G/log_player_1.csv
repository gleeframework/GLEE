{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation. I think it's a price that Bob might be willing to pay, especially if he's truly interested in the product. I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's below my minimum price of $150 and even below what the product is worth to him. While it's tempting to take any offer, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit from my initial offer. How about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is low, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $80 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and lose more time. John is a reliable buyer and I can guarantee a sale with him at my desired price."
