{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my original offer, but higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original asking price. How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
