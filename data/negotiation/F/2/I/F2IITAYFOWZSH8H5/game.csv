"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Consider this - if you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,200,000. This means you could save $100,000 by accepting my offer. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
