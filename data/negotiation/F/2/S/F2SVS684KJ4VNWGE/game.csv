"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1750000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $1000000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Can we meet in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1300000 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This is a significant concession on my end.  Let's try to close this deal, or I might have to look elsewhere.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
