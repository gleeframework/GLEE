Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer sets a strong anchor. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""true worth,""  Alice subtly implies the product might be valued higher elsewhere, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  While John's offer provides a safety net, Alice aims to maximize her profit. Accepting John's offer should only be a last resort if negotiations with Bob fail."
