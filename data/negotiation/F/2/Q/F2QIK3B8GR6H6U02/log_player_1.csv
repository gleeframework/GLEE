"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. There's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and leaves some room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher amount.  I'm confident I can push for more, and I'm not desperate to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm making a small concession, offering $108.  This shows flexibility and signals my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial price. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price and don't need to rush into selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a meeting point between our last offers, showing I'm willing to meet halfway. With only a few rounds left, it's time to finalize the deal and secure a price higher than what John offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, time is running out. While $98 is still better than John's offer, I'm not confident Bob will budge further.  It's better to secure a certain sale with John than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
