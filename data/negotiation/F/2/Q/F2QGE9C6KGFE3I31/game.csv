"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and my original offer of $10,800. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
