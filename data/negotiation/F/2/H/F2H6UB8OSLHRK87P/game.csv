"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I can only afford to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this revised price aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose $900,000 as a compromise. This price still allows you a good profit margin while keeping within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
