"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you think about going down to $102? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still not happy with the price, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum of $120.  Even though John is willing to pay $120, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  $102 is not much higher than the $100 that Bob initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $102 is still too low for me. Let's try $104, which is a fair compromise and closer to my value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 104}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to giving up on negotiating, but I'll try one more time. Can you meet me at $103? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm closer to my minimum of $120, it's time to cut my losses.  We're down to the final few rounds, and it's unlikely that I will be able to convince Bob to pay more than $103.  I'm better off selling the product to John for a sure $120."
