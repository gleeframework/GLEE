Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely he will reach $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
