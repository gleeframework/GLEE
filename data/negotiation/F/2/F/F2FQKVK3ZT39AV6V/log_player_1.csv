Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor:** I'm comfortable selling to John for $1,500,000, so that's my absolute minimum.
* **Bob's value:**  I know Bob values it at $800,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a significant discount (over $200,000) to incentivize Bob to accept, but still leaving myself with a healthy profit.

This offer balances my desire for a high price with the need to make it attractive to Bob.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
