Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He is still saving money compared to buying from John."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He has gotten the price down to $6,850, which is a significant savings from both John's price and Alice's original asking price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to pay John's full price."
