"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique product that would greatly benefit you. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting quite high above her own valuation of the product.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."
