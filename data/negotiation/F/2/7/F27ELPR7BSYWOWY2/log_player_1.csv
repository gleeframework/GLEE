Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, giving me some room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, which is the product's value to me. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer, and it shows a willingness to compromise. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, so I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do at this point."
