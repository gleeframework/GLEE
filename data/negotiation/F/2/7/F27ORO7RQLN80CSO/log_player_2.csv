Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $850,000, I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice will decide not to budge.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
