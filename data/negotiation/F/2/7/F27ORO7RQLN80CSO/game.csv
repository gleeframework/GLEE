"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $850,000, I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
