Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's better than his initial $80 value, it's still below my minimum of $120. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a fair price for both of us, and you'll be getting a great product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're willing to go up to $92, which is appreciated.  However, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  Let's compromise at $98.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a product you'll enjoy."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $98 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I think I can get a bit more by holding out for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer to my price, I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we meet in the middle at $96?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $96. I'm willing to go up to $94, but I really need to make a decision soon. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I've gone through 8 rounds of negotiation and I'm still not close to my desired price of $120. Bob's final offer of $94 is very close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $120.  It's the best option for me at this point."
