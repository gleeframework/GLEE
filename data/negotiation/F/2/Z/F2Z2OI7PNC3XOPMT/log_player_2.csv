"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of this product to you. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  However, if this doesn't align with your budget, I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a price of $800000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
