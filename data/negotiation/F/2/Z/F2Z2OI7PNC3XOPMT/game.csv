"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of this product to you. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  However, if this doesn't align with your budget, I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a price of $800000. ",850000.0,Alice,1,
