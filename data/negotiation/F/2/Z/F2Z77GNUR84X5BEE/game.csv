"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a fair price considering the product's worth.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $10,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a fair price, and it would allow us both to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
