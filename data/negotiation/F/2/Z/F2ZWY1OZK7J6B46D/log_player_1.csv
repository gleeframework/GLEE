Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $725,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at this point?

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is steadily increasing his offer, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially end up with a lower offer or a stalemate, it's more strategic at this point to take John's guaranteed offer."
