"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  This reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $750,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $725,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $725,000. I'm now offering the product for $735,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",735000.0,Alice,5,
