"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the confidence you have in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $800000 is below what I believe the product is truly worth, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1150000 for the product.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
