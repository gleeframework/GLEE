"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a little too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate a lower price before settling. You're willing to pay John $10,000, so there's room to go up with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer moves closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation and staying below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm at $9,000. While you could try for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she won't budge. Accepting the $9,000 offer secures you the product at a price lower than John's $10,000."
