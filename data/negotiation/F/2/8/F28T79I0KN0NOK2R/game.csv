"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product and willing to pay up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to go up to $820,000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $820,000. I'll make another offer that's slightly higher than my previous one. I'll offer the product to you for $845,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",845000.0,Alice,5,
