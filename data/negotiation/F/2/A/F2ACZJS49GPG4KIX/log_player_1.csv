"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **First Round Strategy:** In the first round, I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  Bob's interest in the product is clear, and he's willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a compromise. 
* **Staying the Course:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal happen.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Moving Closer:**  $13,000 is still higher than my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message is again friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still trying to get a price closer to the product's actual worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $10500 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's closer, it's not yet in a range I'm comfortable with.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Bob is showing persistence and willingness to negotiate, indicating a potential for a deal. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to nudge the price higher. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and avoid settling too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** I'm offering $12,500, which is only $500 above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a sincere attempt to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to emphasize that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies that I'm close to my limit, adding a bit of pressure to reach a deal.
* **Time Management:**  With limited rounds remaining, I'm actively trying to close the deal while still protecting my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $11,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Even though it's closer, I'm not willing to accept a significant loss.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  If I accept this offer, I'm losing money.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob is still negotiating and willing to pay more than his initial offer. This suggests there's a chance to get closer to my target price.  
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to nudge the price higher.

I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to get a better deal within the remaining time."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still holding out for $12,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  We're both close, and I believe this product will be a great investment for you. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm firmly stating my minimum acceptable price, making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, encouraging him to see the long-term benefits of investing in it.
* **Urgency:** The message implies a sense of urgency, hinting that we're nearing the end of the negotiation.
* **Time Management:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm taking a firm stance, but also leaving room for potential compromise.

I'm taking a risk by holding firm, but I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can still close the deal at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $11000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are down to the last two rounds.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob is refusing to budge from $11,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer means selling the product for less than its worth to me.  While there's a slight chance of a better offer in the next round, it's a gamble that might not pay off.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, which is my minimum profit margin.  

It's more sensible to secure a guaranteed sale with John rather than risk losing money or running out of time with Bob."
