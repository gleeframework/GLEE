Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my desired value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, making the offer more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $14,000 allows for potential counteroffers while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more if possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still within a range where I can potentially earn more.  He's demonstrated his willingness to pay a premium, and further negotiation might get me closer to my desired price.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** While $12,500 is a decent offer, I'm not desperate to sell and believe there's room for improvement.
* **No Immediate Pressure:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a backup, but not my ideal outcome. There's no rush to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $13,000 feels like a fair compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by decreasing my offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll receive.
* **Strategic Compromise:** $13,000 is a middle ground that's still above John's offer, giving me a better return.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'd like to try to get closer to my target of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $12,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,500. This is a good outcome, considering my initial goal of $14,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob will walk away or offer a lower price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations might take more time and effort, which could be better spent elsewhere.
* **Secure Deal:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profitable outcome."
