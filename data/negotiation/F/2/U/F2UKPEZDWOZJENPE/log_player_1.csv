Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 850,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the options, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price, but not too close, since I don't know what Bob is willing to pay. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 750,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've sent a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 750,000}

Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do next. He can accept my counteroffer, reject it and make another counteroffer, or reject it and walk away."
