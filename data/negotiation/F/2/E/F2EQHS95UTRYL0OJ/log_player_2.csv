"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. Given the value of the product to both parties, I am unable to agree to a price below $12,000. I would be happy to continue discussing this further if you're open to revisiting the price at or above $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $12,000.  While you could try another counteroffer, there's a risk of Alice walking away.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a price that's still $3,000 lower than John's offer, making it the best option."
