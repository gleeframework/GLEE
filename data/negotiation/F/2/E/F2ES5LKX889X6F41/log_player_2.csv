Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little further, but $9,750 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $10,125?  That's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about this, let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and it's not worth risking losing the product entirely. Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price."
