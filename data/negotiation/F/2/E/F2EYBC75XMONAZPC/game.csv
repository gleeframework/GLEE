,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. Could you consider $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,4,
