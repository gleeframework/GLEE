# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. Could you consider $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.
