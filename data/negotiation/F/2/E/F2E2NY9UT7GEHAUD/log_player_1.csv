"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential to get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I hope this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly lower than my minimum and I'm not willing to accept such a big loss.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. While I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
