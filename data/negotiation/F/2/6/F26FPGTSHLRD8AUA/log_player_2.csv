"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000).  This indicates a strong desire to sell, which is advantageous for Bob. There is room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to push for a lower price, ideally closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This seems fair considering the product's value and the fact that we both want to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go above $975,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm proposing a price of $965,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come very close to Bob's last counteroffer. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential gains are getting smaller. Accepting this offer saves $235,000 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise.  There's a risk Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price."
