{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** I won't accept less than $1,000,000 because I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.

Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Gain:** Bob gets a $150,000 discount ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000). 
* **My Gain:** I make a significant profit above my minimum ($1,350,000 >> $1,000,000).

By starting with a strong offer, I leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle."
