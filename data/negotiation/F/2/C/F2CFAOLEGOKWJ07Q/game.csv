"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000, but I can meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000. How about we try $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
