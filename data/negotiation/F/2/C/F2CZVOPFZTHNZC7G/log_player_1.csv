"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and provide insight into his perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  You have the option to sell to John for your minimum, so there's no need to accept a loss.  It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly in a higher range. I could consider coming down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm, but Show Flexibility:**  You're signaling that you're willing to negotiate by dropping $75,000 from your initial offer. However, you're still well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to your desired price range. By making a significant but not drastic reduction, you encourage him to do the same.
* **Time Consideration:**  While you have time, it's good to make progress. This offer keeps the negotiation moving and prevents it from stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is now significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. This offer represents a strong profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale to John's standing offer."
