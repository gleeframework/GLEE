"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at $825000. However, I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $875000. How about $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $875000, but I think I can do slightly better than that. How about $862500? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it reasonable.",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is the middle point between $825000 and $875000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but I'd like to propose a small premium for the product's exclusivity and uniqueness. How about $857500? It's a slight increase, but I think it's worth it for this exceptional product.",857500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's exclusivity and uniqueness, but I'm not willing to pay the premium. I'll meet you at $850000, and that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm at $850000, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $855000? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this exceptional product. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",855000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay $850000, and I'm not budging from that price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away from the deal. I appreciate your time, but I think I'll explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,10,
