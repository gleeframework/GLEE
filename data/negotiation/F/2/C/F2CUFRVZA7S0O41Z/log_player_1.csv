Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you believe the product is worth ""a great deal,"" you subtly imply it might be worth more than $120 to Bob, even if it's only worth $100 to him objectively.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob.  It weakens your negotiating position. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back, but don't go below your $100 minimum."
