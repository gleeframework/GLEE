Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $15,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that's the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $14000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds and I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price from him.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee myself a decent profit."
