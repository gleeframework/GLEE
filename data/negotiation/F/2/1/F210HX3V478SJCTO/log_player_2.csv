"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He wants to try to negotiate a lower price again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,250 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price, and Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000 to save money."
