"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute maximum to allow for some room for negotiation.
* **Knowing My Floor:** I'm aware of my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and will not go lower than that.

This initial offer will provide insight into Bob's perceived value of the product.  I'll analyze his response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:**  Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is a good deal, I believe there's more room for negotiation, especially since I have 8 more rounds. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.

By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,400,000, a price that's still higher than his offer but significantly closer to his offer. 
* **Compromise:**  This counter-offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a good price for the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our initial positions to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This counter-offer gives Bob another chance to accept, but it also sets the stage for further negotiation if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lower Offer:** Bob's offer has dropped again to $1,150,000. While this is still above my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my initial asking price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are now in round 4, meaning there are only 6 rounds left.  I need to be strategic about maximizing my return.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Although Bob is lowering his offers, I'm still hopeful he'll eventually come up in price.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore if I can do better. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer that aims to bridge the gap and hopefully convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Bar:** I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000, acknowledging that Bob seems to be sticking to his lower price range.
* **Maintaining a Margin:**  This offer still gives me a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are now at the halfway point in the negotiation process.  I need to start closing the gap to avoid risking a deal with John or running out of rounds. 

This counteroffer is a compromise, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Persistent Low Offer:** Bob's offer is now at $1,100,000, which is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I still believe I can get a better price.
* **Remaining Rounds:** We have 4 rounds left. This is a crucial point in the negotiation.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob has consistently lowered his offers, it's still possible he could increase his offer. 

By rejecting this offer, I'm taking a risk, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit by seeing if Bob will come up with a better offer. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Stretch:** With only three rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** My offer of $1,250,000 is a significant compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept, as I don't want to risk losing the deal by running out of rounds.

This counteroffer represents my final attempt to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 higher than John's guaranteed offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to two rounds left. There's a high risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers in the final rounds.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, I don't want to risk losing a substantial amount of money by rejecting Bob's offer and ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all. 

Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. It's the most sensible decision with only two rounds left."
