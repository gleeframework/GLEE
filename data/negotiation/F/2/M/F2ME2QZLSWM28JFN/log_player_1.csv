Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Be open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price further. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which provides a strong fallback position. 

This strategy balances the desire to get a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer provides a strong safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's more favorable to me, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually acceptable deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and increase the likelihood of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. If you're serious about buying this product, I'm ready to negotiate, but let's get closer to that figure. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bridging the gap:**  $1,000,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to keep talking, but it also highlights the need for a more significant change in Bob's offer. 

This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged while demonstrating that I won't be swayed by lowball offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's come up slightly, $950,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance that further negotiation with Bob will only result in more concessions from my side, potentially leading to a final price that's still below my minimum.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

Given that John's offer provides a secure and highly profitable outcome, I've decided to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John."
