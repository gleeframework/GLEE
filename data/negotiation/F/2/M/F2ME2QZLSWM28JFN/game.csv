"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. If you're serious about buying this product, I'm ready to negotiate, but let's get closer to that figure. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
