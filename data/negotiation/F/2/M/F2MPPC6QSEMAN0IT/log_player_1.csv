We're still below John's offer, and there's room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and inching closer to our desired price range."

Bob is getting very close to John's offer, and the potential gains from continuing the negotiation are getting smaller. It's now more strategic to take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000 rather than risk Bob not reaching that price point in the remaining rounds."
