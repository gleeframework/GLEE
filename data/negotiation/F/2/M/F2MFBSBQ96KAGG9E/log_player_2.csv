"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still determined to negotiate a better price. Her offer of $1,150,000 is still too high, but I want to see if I can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $1,100,000 is still not enough to meet my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the same as her initial offer.  It seems like she's not willing to come down further.  I've already reached the limit of what I'm comfortable paying, so it's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This will save me $200,000 compared to buying from Alice at her current offer."
