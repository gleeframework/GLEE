"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant price reduction and still leaves room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still not meeting my needs. I'm prepared to go as low as $1,000,000. This is a final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
