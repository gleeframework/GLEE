"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time offer of $12000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9000? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10500. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $11200. I think this is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest counteroffer of $11200. I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10800. I really want to make this work, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $10800. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more small concession, and that's $11100. I think this is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer of $11100. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll make a final counteroffer of $10900. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll take the product. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10900.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your final counteroffer of $10900. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to have to decline your offer and explore other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $10000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're interested, I can still consider your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11100. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,9,
