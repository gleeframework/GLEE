{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a bit below my minimum value of $10,000, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's potential for us to agree on a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above his stated value, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I'm confident this price is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer is a good compromise and will prevent me from having to sell to John at a lower price."
