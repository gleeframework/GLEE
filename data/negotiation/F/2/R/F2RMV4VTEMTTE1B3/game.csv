"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While I agree it's a great product, $550,000 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Could we make it $500,000?  That would seal the deal for me.",500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $525,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
