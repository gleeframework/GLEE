"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which has been meticulously designed and developed with cutting-edge technology. This product holds immense value for us, but given its exceptional capabilities, we believe it would be an invaluable asset for you. Considering its worth to both parties, I am offering it to you for $13,500. This price encapsulates the product's quality, the time invested in its creation, and the potential benefits it could bring to you. We hope to discuss this further and potentially make this a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price. Her message emphasizes the product's value *to her*  and uses language suggesting room for negotiation (""mutually beneficial transaction"").  By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price and open the door for a counter-offer."
