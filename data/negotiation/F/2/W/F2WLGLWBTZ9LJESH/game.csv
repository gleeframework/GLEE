,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, especially considering its potential in your hands. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider other options if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
