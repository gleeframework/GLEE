"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price, especially since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  It's good to have that in mind, but you should try to get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value to me and your desired profit margin."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  $1,150,000 is still below your $1,500,000 maximum.
* **Negotiating further could be risky.** Alice is showing willingness to compromise, and pushing too hard could lead to her refusing to negotiate further, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Accepting now saves time and potential headaches.** You get the product for a price that is acceptable, and you avoid the risk of a lengthy negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
