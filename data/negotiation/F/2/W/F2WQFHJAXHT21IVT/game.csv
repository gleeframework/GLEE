"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $14000.  If you're open to that, let's make a deal. ",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
