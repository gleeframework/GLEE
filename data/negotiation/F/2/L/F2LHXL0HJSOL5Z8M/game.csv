"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This reflects a significant increase on my part, and I'm hopeful it demonstrates my seriousness about closing this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit on my end.
