"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. It's a unique and highly valuable item that I'm confident you'll love.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but need to stay within my limit of $800000.  I'm willing to offer $500000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $500000 is below the product's value. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial offer. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $700000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. However, I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
