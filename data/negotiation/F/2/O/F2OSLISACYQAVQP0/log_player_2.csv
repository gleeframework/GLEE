# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. It's a unique and highly valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but need to stay within my limit of $800,000.  I'm willing to offer $500,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $500000 is below the product's value. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial offer. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget.  You should continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. However, I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget. It's time to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $800,000. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it doesn't seem like Alice is willing to come down to your desired price."
