Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $12,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000).  
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me a safety net, allowing me to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's showing interest and willing to negotiate.
* **John's offer:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with Bob, but I have John's offer as a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,500 to $11,500.
* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining value:**  $11,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, ensuring I'm getting a good price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
