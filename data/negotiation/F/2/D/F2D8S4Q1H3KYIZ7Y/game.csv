"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering the value it brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
