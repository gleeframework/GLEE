Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. I believe its value to you will far exceed the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's ambitious:** By aiming high, you potentially maximize your profit.
* **It includes a compelling message:** The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, which can encourage him to consider the offer.

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below your desired outcome. You should aim for more by:

* **Counteroffering:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price.  
* **Showing flexibility:** Your counteroffer could be slightly lower than your initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** Remind Bob of the product's unique benefits and why its value justifies a higher price.

Don't settle for less than you believe the product is worth. Good luck!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the unique features and potential benefits of this product justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000.  I'm confident you'll find this investment to be very worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer balances your desire to make a profit with the need to be flexible. It's a reasonable compromise that demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price significantly above your minimum acceptable amount. 

Remember to be confident and persuasive in your message to encourage Bob to accept your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your fallback option of selling to John for $800,000. While it's not your initial asking price, it's still a good profit for you.  

It's important to recognize that negotiations are rarely perfect.  You've successfully achieved a good outcome by being flexible and persuasive while still securing a profitable sale."
