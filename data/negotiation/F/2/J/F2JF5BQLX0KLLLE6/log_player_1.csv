Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is still below Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000, suggesting there's potential for both of you to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By not starting with a ridiculously high price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate fairly. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's important to remember that you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the possibility of a higher price open. It's also a good strategy to show Bob you're not desperate to sell at his low price. 

Let's counter with a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above your minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation, showing that you're open to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale."
