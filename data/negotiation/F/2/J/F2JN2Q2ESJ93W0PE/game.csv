"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
