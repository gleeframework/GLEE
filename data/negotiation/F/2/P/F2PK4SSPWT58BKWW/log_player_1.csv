While a counteroffer from Bob of $915,000 is close to my minimum, it's still not as high as the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. There's a good chance Bob will continue to lowball me, and I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially money.  Selling to John now guarantees a better outcome."
