Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you.  I'm offering it for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $150 is above your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob away with an outrageous price.
* **It's friendly and open:**  The message is welcoming and invites Bob to respond. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a little too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:** It clearly states that I'm not willing to accept $100.
* **Provides a compromise:**  $125 is a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Maintains a friendly tone:**  It's important to keep the negotiation positive and avoid getting confrontational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough.  John is offering me $120, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering. I'm going to sell the product to John."
