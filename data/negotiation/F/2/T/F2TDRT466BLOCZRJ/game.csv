,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a little too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Bob,4,
