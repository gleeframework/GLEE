Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to start high to maximize your potential gain. However, you don't want to start so high that Bob immediately walks away without countering. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  You want to project that you believe in the value of the product.
* **Open to Discussion:**  ""Initial proposal"" and ""starting point"" signal willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a softer approach might be better.

**Remember:** This is just the opening move.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how low you are willing to go.  You always have John as a backup!"
