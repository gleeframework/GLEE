"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. "",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're aiming for a good deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial offer is too high and presents a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Aim:** While my maximum is $800,000, starting significantly lower gives Alice space to counter and potentially still reach a price well below my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $975,000. This is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $975,000 is still significantly higher than my target price of $800,000 and even further from my initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to come down in price suggests there's still negotiating room.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of buying from John for $800,000, which gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $975,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase.  I can go up to $750,000. If that's not workable, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But with Limits:**  Showing willingness to move upward demonstrates seriousness, but the increase is still calculated.
* **Introducing a Soft Deadline:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice of my alternative and adds a subtle sense of urgency. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** Aiming towards a price around $750,000 could potentially lead to a final agreement closer to my $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself in this deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a strong alternative buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and introduced a sense of competition with another buyer.
* **Unacceptable Price:**  Even with her final reduction, $900,000 is still $100,000 over my maximum budget.
* **Secure Alternative:** I have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000, ensuring I don't overspend.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the guaranteed deal with John."
