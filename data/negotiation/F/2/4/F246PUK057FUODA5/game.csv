"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. ",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $975,000. This is a more reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $975,000 is still more than I had budgeted for this purchase.  I can go up to $750,000. If that's not workable, I may have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself in this deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a strong alternative buyer lined up.",900000.0,Alice,5,
