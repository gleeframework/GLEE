"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $102.50?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do it for $95? That's the most I can offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
