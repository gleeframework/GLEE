Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is Bob's perceived value, starting with a slightly lower offer allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasize the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of an ""exclusive opportunity"" might make the offer more enticing. 

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving you with a comfortable profit margin if you need to sell to John."
