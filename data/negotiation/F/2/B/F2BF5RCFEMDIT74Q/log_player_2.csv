Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value I think the product holds, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price.

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not ready to go all the way down to $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1320000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I think the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point, and I'm running the risk of going back and forth with her for too long. It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget."
