"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value I think the product holds, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not ready to go all the way down to $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1320000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I think the product holds.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
