"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate, and hopefully, Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll use the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my best offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $95. Let's split the difference and get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my ideal price.  I still have some rounds left and I don't want to settle for less than I can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
