,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a price that works.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider letting it go for $920,000. This is a compromise that ensures you're getting a great deal on something truly valuable.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $880,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,4,
