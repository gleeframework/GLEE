"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's desired price range. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a price that works."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $100,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is significant but not overly aggressive. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal.

* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation process and leaves room for further discussion."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider letting it go for $920,000. This is a compromise that ensures you're getting a great deal on something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $880,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental improvement:**  This counteroffer increases Bob's offer by $30,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While that offer is tempting, I need to stay firm around $900,000. This price reflects the true worth of what you're getting.  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.
