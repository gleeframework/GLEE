"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the first round, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will keep pushing for a higher price, and he might end up paying more than he wants.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's a safer option to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
