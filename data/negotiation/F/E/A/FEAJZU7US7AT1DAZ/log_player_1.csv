Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to part with it for $135. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $135 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating a sense of exclusivity:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you add a subtle pressure that he might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Justification:** While slightly high, mentioning your own perceived value of ""$120 or more""  provides a basis for the asking price without completely revealing your hand.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept your offer."
