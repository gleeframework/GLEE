Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This is a starting point that is above my minimum price ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential higher value for the product.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a good starting point that could lead to a higher price.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintain John as a backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that there's room for negotiation, and I'd like to explore that further. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob's willingness to offer $1,050,000 indicates the product has significant value to him.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000, and I believe a counteroffer can help achieve that.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, I want to explore all possibilities before settling.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant concession from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price from $1,250,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the concession I've made, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This price is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Clear intent:** This counteroffer shows my determination to reach a deal with Bob while still safeguarding my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still finding it a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than John's offer, and I'm confident that this price will be a good deal for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and risk:**  The risk of further negotiation and potential rejection is higher than the potential gain of getting a slightly better price. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation has been going on for a while, and I am ready to finalize the deal.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob's offer represents a fair middle ground between our previous positions.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a profitable sale and avoid the uncertainty and potential loss associated with further negotiation."
