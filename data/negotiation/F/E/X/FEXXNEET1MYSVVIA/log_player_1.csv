"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This will give me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also mindful of the 10 round limit, so I want to push for a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for slightly more, $920,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I also want to avoid having to sell to John at the lower price of $800,000."
