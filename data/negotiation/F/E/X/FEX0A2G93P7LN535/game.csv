"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
