"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit and the product's potential. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal succeed.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
