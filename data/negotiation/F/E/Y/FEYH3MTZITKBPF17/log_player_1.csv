Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit and the product's potential. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal succeed."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some movement, his offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I receive my minimum price and avoids further negotiation risk."
