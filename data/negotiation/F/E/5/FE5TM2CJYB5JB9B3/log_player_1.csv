Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to him. This allows for some room to negotiate, and if he rejects, I can still make a profit by selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, as it's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair price, and if he rejects, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product for more, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
