"Alice, $15,000 is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still outside of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
