"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $700000. The product's value is truly exceptional, and I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $725000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can go a bit lower. How about we meet at $675000? I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $675000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I'll counter with $700000. I believe this is a more realistic price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $700000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see some more movement. How about we try $680000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",680000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $690000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $685000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",685000.0,Alice,7,

I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to be comfortable with the price. How about we try $682500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",682500.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me. However, I've decided to explore other options. I'm willing to make a final offer of $650000.
