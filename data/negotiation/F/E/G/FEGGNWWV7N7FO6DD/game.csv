"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500.

"I appreciate your willingness to move on price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
