Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This allows for a few rounds of counter-offers without me having to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further, keeping the door open for a successful deal.

This initial offer balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still potentially negotiate with Bob and reach a more favorable price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore if we can find a middle ground.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me leverage.  I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and aim for a better price without risking selling below my desired minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still standing my ground. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""keeps the deal moving forward"" to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Avoiding drastic change:**  A smaller jump from $9,500 to $9,000 is less likely to deter Bob than a larger drop.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a reasonable price:**  $9,000 is still within my acceptable range and closer to my initial goal.
* **Keep the deal alive:**  It shows flexibility while making it clear I won't settle for a price too far below my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $8,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,250 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This is even further away from my desired price than the previous offer.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob might take too many rounds and could further lower the price. 
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a good return on the product.

While I want to get the best possible price,  time is a factor, and I don't want to risk ending up with a much lower price than I'm comfortable with. John offers a safe and profitable solution, so it's the best decision in this scenario."
