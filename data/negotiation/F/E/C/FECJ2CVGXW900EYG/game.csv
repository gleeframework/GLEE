"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I know it holds similar value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Please consider my offer carefully, as I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your company.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
