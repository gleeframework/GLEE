Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, $1,500,000.  This is a firm offer, as it's my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I hope Bob recognizes the value and accepts."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating with Bob.  Although Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident he'll come up to my asking price. It's safer to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
