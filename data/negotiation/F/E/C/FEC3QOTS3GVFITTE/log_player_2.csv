"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000 and a good deal compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer will save Bob money and secure the product."
