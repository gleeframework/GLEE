Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept, giving myself room to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage in a conversation rather than just rejecting. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While short, mentioning that Bob would enjoy the product is a subtle reminder of its value.

This strategy aims to start a negotiation with Bob, maximizing the potential for a higher sale price. If he rejects, I can then assess if it's worth continuing negotiations or simply selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm not willing to sell for below my minimum of $100, and John is a reliable alternative. I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating that it's too low.
* **Compromise:**  Suggesting a price that's halfway between our current offers shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping a friendly and open tone will encourage Bob to continue negotiations.

By offering $90, I'm increasing my chances of selling to Bob without having to resort to selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and not worth the risk of further negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that option by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
