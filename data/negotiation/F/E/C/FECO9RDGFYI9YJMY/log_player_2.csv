"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. Would you consider $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,200 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Alice.  He's shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has already lowered her price once.  There's still room for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower, though. How about $10,800?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11400. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but the rounds are getting shorter.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,400 saves Bob $600 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy at John's price is increasing.  It's a calculated risk to accept this offer and secure the product."
