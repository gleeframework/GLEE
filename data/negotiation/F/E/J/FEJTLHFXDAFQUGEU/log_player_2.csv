Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my original asking price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for a lower price from John.  Although Alice has come down in price, it's still not low enough for Bob to consider buying from her."
