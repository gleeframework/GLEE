"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my original asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider coming down to $1,000,000? This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring I don't go over my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
