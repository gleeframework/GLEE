"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bigger investment than I had in mind.  Could we consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $950,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your initial investment concerns.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could you do $800,000?  That's the very top of what I can spend.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. That said, I've got a lot invested in this product, and $800,000 wouldn't be doing it justice.  I'm willing to make one final offer: $900,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
