Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is certainly not unreasonable, I'm confident this product can deliver far more value than that.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1250000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, but still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try to get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
