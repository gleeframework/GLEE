Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I can potentially get closer to my desired price range by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a bit more by continuing to negotiate.  The value of the product to Bob is higher, and with a few more rounds, I might be able to get closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $9,500 is still a bit below what I need. Let's meet in the middle.
