"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 represents a more accurate valuation of this product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand where you're coming from.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This shows my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. Let's make it happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
