# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but still higher than the product's worth to me. This shows I'm serious about buying but need a better price. 
* **Justification:** I'm offering a price that's still a ""good deal"" for Alice, highlighting a potential win-win scenario.
* **Openness:** My message is positive and suggests a willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 represents a more accurate valuation of this product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a better option at this stage."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** I'm reiterating my previous offer, showing I'm not budging significantly and am sticking to my principles.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reminding Alice that my offer is fair to both of us, promoting a win-win outcome.
* **Call to Compromise:** I'm suggesting finding a compromise to move the negotiation forward.

**Note:** I'm keeping my offer consistent for now, as it's within my budget and I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further. I'm still open to negotiating, but not willing to drastically increase my offer at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand where you're coming from.  Let's find a solution we can both agree on. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This shows my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm going to hold firm and counter with a lower offer, hoping to push her closer to my target. Buying from John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```
