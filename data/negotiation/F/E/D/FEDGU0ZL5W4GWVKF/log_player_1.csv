"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $2,000,000 is significantly above my minimum, allowing for a substantial drop in price during negotiations.
* **Establishing Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price based on the product's value, setting a baseline expectation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging an open dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1500000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is my absolute minimum.  Accepting it would leave me with no profit margin and wouldn't be worth the risk of losing a potential higher offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still leaves some room for both of us. This price reflects the value I know the product holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Maintain Value:** I'm lowering my price but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum. This shows flexibility while conveying that the product is still valuable.
* **Framing the Offer Positively:**  I emphasize the ""room for both of us,"" suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Highlighting the Product's Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price, keeping the focus on its intrinsic value.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I explicitly invite Bob to reach an agreement, signaling a willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Accepting would leave me with limited gain and potentially less than what John is offering.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and I can continue to push for a price closer to my target.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing him further towards my desired price point.
* **John Remains a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer as a fallback option allows me to take calculated risks during the negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm decreasing my price again, showing flexibility but not giving away too much. 
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I reiterate the product's value as a justification for the price, reinforcing its worth.
* **Addressing Budget Constraints:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations to make him feel heard and potentially increase his willingness to compromise.
* **Seeking a Mutually Beneficial Solution:** I emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us, creating a collaborative tone.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, hoping to push him to a price closer to my desired target. 
*  My offer is still significantly higher than my minimum and provides a reasonable profit margin. 
*  John remains a viable option if negotiations fail."
