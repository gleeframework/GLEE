"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which still leaves some room for both of us. This price reflects the value I know the product holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal range.  Bob has more room to negotiate and should continue to aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1650000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** While it's not the ideal price, $1,650,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and within Bob's $1,000,000 limit.
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive.**  Bob has already made a counteroffer and been rejected, suggesting Alice may not be willing to budge much further.  
* **Risk of losing the deal.** If Bob continues to reject Alice's offers, there's a chance she'll get frustrated and stop negotiating altogether. 

Considering these factors, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and getting stuck with the more expensive option from John."
