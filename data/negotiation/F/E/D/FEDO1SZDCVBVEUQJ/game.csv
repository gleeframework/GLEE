"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $9,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
