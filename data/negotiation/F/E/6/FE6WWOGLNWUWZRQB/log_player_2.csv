Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we both seem interested in getting this deal done. I've made significant concessions to get us to this point. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm price, and I won't go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at $1,000,000 and indicating it's her final offer.  While it's possible further negotiation could bring the price down slightly, it's unlikely to reach a point that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing."
