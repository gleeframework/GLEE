"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's significantly lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  That said, I am interested in the product. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be frank, $650,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal. How about $1,200,000?  This is a very strong offer, and I need you to meet me closer to this price if we're going to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. It seems like we both want to make a deal here. How about $750,000? That's a big jump for me, but I'm serious about buying the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we both seem interested in getting this deal done. I've made significant concessions to get us to this point. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm price, and I won't go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
