Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,000,000 is not within my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob is unlikely to move much closer to my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
