"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Let's aim for a price that's closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $11000. What do you think?"
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $10000. Let's try $10800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10800.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I think the product's value to me is higher than $10000, and I'd like to get closer to that. I'll make one more counteroffer. Let's try $11500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us."
"I understand we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11500, so I'll offer you $10750. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,,
