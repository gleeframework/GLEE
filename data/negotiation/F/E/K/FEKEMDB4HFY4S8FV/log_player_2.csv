"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1400000. It's a valuable asset with a potential worth of $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  While Alice's offer is less than her value, it's still more than you are willing to pay.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
