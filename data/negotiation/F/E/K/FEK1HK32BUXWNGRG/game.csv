"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and leaves some room for negotiation.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference and meet at $10,250. This allows both of us a good deal and moves us closer to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not ready to give up too much. I'll offer you a compromise: $10,750. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a cost, but $10,750 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this is a fair price that would allow us to finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a slightly reduced price: $10,700. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,7,
