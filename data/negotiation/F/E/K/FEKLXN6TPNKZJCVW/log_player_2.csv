"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $87.50 is better than $90, he can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer. It's worth testing if Alice is willing to go lower than $87.50."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high at $87.50. Would you be willing to do $86? I'm really close to my budget, but I'm pretty confident this product would be a great fit."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to 86, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at 88? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $100, and Alice's offer of $88 is within that range. While Bob was hoping to get the product for $86, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. Accepting the offer at $88 saves Bob $12 compared to buying from John and is a reasonable compromise.  Further negotiation might take too much time and isn't guaranteed to result in a lower price."
