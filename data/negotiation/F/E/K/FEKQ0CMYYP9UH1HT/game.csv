"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $650,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $550,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle, but I'm firm on $575,000. This is a fair offer considering the value I place on the product.",575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to compromise on the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $585,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",585000.0,Alice,5,
