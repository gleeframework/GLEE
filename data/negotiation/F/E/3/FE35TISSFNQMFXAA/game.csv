"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
