"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum ($150) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale. I'm also keeping the message positive and focusing on the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I want to close the deal, I can't afford to sell for $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price that is still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm also reiterating the fair price aspect to emphasize that I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my desired price, it's getting closer and it's worth closing the deal now to avoid further negotiation.  I'm confident that I'll be able to make up for the $20 difference through other sales."
