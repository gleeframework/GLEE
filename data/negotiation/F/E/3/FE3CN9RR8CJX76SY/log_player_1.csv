"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially lead to a higher final agreement. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and concessions, making Bob feel like they're getting a better deal as the price lowers. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.  His response will give you valuable information about his priorities and how aggressively you can proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, accepting immediately leaves potential profit on the table. You started high to gauge his flexibility, and his immediate jump to your minimum suggests there might be room for negotiation.  You'll counter-offer to explore this further before settling."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I believe this product brings significant value to the table. How about we find a middle ground at $1,400,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching a deal while recognizing the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are making a significant concession by dropping $200,000 from your initial price. This shows Bob you are willing to compromise and encourages him to reciprocate.
* **Holding Ground Above Your Minimum:**  The $1,400,000 counteroffer keeps you comfortably above your $1,200,000 minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You are subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, anchoring the discussion around its worth rather than solely focusing on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I've already reached my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Please consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is signaling that $1,200,000 is his upper limit, but we still have time and room to negotiate. By rejecting again, we increase the perceived risk for Bob that the deal might fall through. This could push him to reconsider and offer a bit more. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000, and it's worth seeing if we can get it before accepting his firm offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and understand your budget constraints. However, I also have to consider the true value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us: $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer presents a price that meets you halfway between Bob's firm offer and your previous ask. It signals that you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Strong Justification:** You are emphasizing the fairness of the price by highlighting both your compromise and Bob's budget concerns. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is a solution that ""works for both of us"", you subtly imply this might be your final offer, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still at a bit of a standstill with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Please consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Firm:** Bob has repeated his $1,200,000 offer multiple times, indicating it's unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Time is Ticking:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures the deal. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  While not ideal, $1,200,000 still meets your minimum acceptable price and ensures a profit. 

Continuing to push for more risks losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept a sure thing than gamble on a potentially higher offer that might not materialize."
