"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to pay. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you at $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $1050000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to compromise.  However, $1080000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1060000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to finalize the deal at this point.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $1060000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000 was a bit too high, but $1060000 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1070000? This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
