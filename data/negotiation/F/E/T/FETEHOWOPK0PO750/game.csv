"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. While we would like to accommodate all our valued customers, I am unable to match your proposed price of $800,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product for $950,000? This price still allows us to cover our costs and provide a reasonable profit, while also being more accessible to you. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and looks forward to your response.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a fair offer for both of us, I believe.",875000.0,Bob,4,
