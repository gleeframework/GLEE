Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This reflects its true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a decent price for the product. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob that surpasses John's offer.  We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and moving closer to Bob's price too quickly could mean leaving money on the table."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,850,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your position."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now significantly closer to our desired price, and well above John's guaranteed offer. While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if we continue to reject his offers. Accepting his offer of $1,700,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
