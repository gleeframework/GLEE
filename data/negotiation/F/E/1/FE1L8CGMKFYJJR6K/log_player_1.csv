Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.

Round 3

This price reflects the unique qualities of the product and its potential for your business."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. It's worth exploring a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still just slightly below my minimum.  I'm proposing a final compromise at $875,000.  This price allows for a significant profit for me while still offering you a very valuable product at a competitive price.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good return on my investment. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  With only four rounds left, I need to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to settle with John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to recoup most of my value."
