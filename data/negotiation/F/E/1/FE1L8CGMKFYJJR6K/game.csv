"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $800000 is below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive fair value for this product. I'm proposing $900000. This price reflects the unique qualities of the product and its potential for your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is closer, it's still just slightly below my minimum.  I'm proposing a final compromise at $875000.  This price allows for a significant profit for me while still offering you a very valuable product at a competitive price.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial solution.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but no higher.
