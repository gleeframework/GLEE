"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
