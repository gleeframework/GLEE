"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly less than buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate a lower price, accepting this offer guarantees you get the product at a good price."
