"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to earn a good profit. I'm confident that with a good message and some bargaining, I can secure a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I think I can get more. I'm going to try and counteroffer at a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise that I'm willing to make to get the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92.50 is closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a bit more, especially since I have several rounds remaining. I'm going to try and counteroffer again, but I'll be more willing to accept a deal in the next few rounds if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle.  $92.50 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get just a little bit closer to my initial price of $95. Would you be willing to go up to $94? This way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $93. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you live with that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $93 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $120."
