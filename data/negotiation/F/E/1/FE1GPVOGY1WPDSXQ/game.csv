,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $95? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise that I'm willing to make to get the product",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle.  $92.50 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get just a little bit closer to my initial price of $95. Would you be willing to go up to $94? This way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",94.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $93. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you live with that?",93.0,Bob,6,
