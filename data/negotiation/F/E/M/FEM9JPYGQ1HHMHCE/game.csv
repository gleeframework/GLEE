"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you consider a price closer to that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could consider coming down to $100.  It's a fair offer for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $70? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $85? That's my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $70, but I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. Would you be willing to meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
