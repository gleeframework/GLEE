Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Continuing to negotiate with him risks leaving Alice with an even lower offer or losing the opportunity to sell to John for her minimum acceptable price of $80."
