"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree this product is valuable, but I believe the price is a little high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could work with a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value at $1,100,000, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be open to $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
