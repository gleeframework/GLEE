"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 seems a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $120 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $95? That would seal the deal for me.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
