"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175. It's a steal for the value it offers! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John is offering.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 seems a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($100). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still stay within my budget. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  While low, the offer isn't offensively low. The message aims to maintain a positive tone and show I'm interested in negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still more than I want to pay when I know I can get it for $100 from John.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $120 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $95? That would seal the deal for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm staying well below her offer to signal I'm looking for a significant price drop. 
* **Introducing Urgency:** By saying ""$95 would seal the deal,"" I'm suggesting this is my final offer, which might encourage her to accept rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** Crucially, I'm still below my fallback option of buying from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110. It's clear I won't get the price I want from her.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John for $100."
