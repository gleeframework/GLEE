Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low, and it's clear he's not willing to come close to my desired price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I don't lose out, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's still a good outcome."
