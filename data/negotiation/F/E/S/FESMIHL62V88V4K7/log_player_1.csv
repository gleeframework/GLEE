{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll secure a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Slight Markup:** A price of $135 represents a reasonable markup from your minimum price ($120) and is still within a justifiable range for Bob, given the product's worth to him.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept your offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Be prepared to potentially negotiate the price down a bit if Bob counters your offer.  However, don't go below your $120 minimum, as you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
