"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm interested but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1050000? This would allow us to finalize the deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
