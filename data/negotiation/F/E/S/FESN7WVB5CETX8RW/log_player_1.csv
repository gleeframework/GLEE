"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that could be a real game-changer for your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential benefits of the product for Bob, hoping to increase its perceived value in his eyes. 

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a good starting point.** 
* **Encourage Bob to counter-offer.** This gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy. 
* **Set the tone for a constructive negotiation.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great product, but I've done my research and I think it's worth less than your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  While I want to secure a deal, accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.  
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  My counteroffer will be higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and builds trust."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is just not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering $1,350,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the offer as a way to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I continue using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

**Next Steps:**

* By offering a counteroffer, I am continuing the negotiation process, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* I will closely analyze Bob's response to determine my next move. If he rejects this counteroffer, I may need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,350,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's willing to meet halfway, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Time is running out:** We're already four rounds in, and I need to be mindful of the limited number of rounds.
* **John is a viable option:**  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, and the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is increasing. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer once more, aiming to get closer to my desired price. If this attempt fails, I will likely sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential. This is my final offer. If you're not able to agree to this, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  I've lowered my price further, but this is my limit. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value once again, hoping to persuade Bob.
* **Set a Deadline:** By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and increasing the pressure on Bob.
* **Open to Other Options:** I mention that I have other options (John) to encourage Bob to take this offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will sell the product to John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiations with Bob at this point as his offer is too low, and I'm approaching the round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a significant concession from my end. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even with his ""significant concession,"" Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already six rounds in, and my patience is wearing thin.
* **John is a safe bet:**  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, and the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is not worth it at this point.  His stubbornness and inability to meet my minimum price make him an unreliable buyer.

**Next Steps:**

* By choosing to sell to John, I'm ensuring a secure and profitable outcome."
