Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,500,000. It's a steal for what it can do, and I know it would be a great asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""steal"" and highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This approach aims to start the negotiation off on a positive note, while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, it's not worth sacrificing the potential for a better deal. 

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, leaving room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a great deal for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns about the price, showing that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is significantly closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a sense of value for the product.
* **Focus on value and compromise:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers and emphasizing my willingness to compromise.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I end with a statement encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made significant compromises, and I don't want to risk ending up with a deal that's less than my minimum.  

John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It ensures I achieve my financial goal without risking further negotiation."
