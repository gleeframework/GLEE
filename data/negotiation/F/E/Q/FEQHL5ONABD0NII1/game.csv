,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand you see value in the product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product's potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and allows me a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,025,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I propose a price of $925,000. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
