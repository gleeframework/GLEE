Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,025,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I propose a price of $925,000. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'll consider it a fair deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He cannot buy the product from John for $800,000 because you are the one selling the product, and you have a standing offer from John for $1,200,000.  

Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. He is stubbornly sticking to a price point far below your minimum. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
