# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $110. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to you. It's better to buy from John for $100."
