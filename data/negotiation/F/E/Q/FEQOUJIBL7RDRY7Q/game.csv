"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $8,525. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",8525.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,525.  If you're truly serious about getting this product, I'm willing to go down to $8,750.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,7,
