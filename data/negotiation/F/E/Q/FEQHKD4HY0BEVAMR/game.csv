"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
