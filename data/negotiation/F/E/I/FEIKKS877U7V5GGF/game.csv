"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe will bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $11,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair compromise between our initial offers.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
