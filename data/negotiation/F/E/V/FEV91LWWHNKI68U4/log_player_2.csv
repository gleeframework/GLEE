"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  He is willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal target of $100. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $115 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to get it for $105.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
