"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my budget and the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, as it leaves room for both profit and a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a little higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
