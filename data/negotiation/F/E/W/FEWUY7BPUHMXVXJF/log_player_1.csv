Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I do too. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the significant cost savings compared to John's offer. Let's make this deal happen.
