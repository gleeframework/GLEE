{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows for some wiggle room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.  It's important to start high and be prepared to negotiate, but remember that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still a good deal, it's below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is still a good profit and a reasonable compromise.  I'm getting closer to my goal and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  It's better to secure the sale and move on."
