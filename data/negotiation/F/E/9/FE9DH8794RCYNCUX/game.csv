"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $95? ",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $95 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives me a fair margin and allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
