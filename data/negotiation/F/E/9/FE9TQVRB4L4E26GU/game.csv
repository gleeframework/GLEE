"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
