"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it allows for room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit on the table. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial price point and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. Bob's immediate counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and is above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a decent compromise, and we're already in round 4. I'd rather secure the deal now than risk further negotiations with Bob or potentially losing the opportunity by selling to John.  $1,250,000 is a good outcome given the starting point."
