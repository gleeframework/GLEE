"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $9,000 is a good price, but there's always the potential to get it even lower. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I'd prefer a lower price, $8,500 is still a good deal, and it's uncertain if further negotiations will yield a better price.  It's a good compromise and saves a significant amount compared to buying from John."
