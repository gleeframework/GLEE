Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a significant value for the product. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,050,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a good deal.  Let's finalize this and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm not confident I can get a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure deal with John."
