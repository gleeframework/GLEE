"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You can get the product for $1,150,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $1,200,000 John is asking. 
* **You're still within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
