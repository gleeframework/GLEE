Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
