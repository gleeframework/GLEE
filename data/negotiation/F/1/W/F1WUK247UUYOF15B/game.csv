"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider this?",12800.0,Bob,4,
