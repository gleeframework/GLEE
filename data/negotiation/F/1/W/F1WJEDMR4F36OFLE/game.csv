"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing, but I'm hoping to secure the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000. This price is still a great deal for you, as you've indicated the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
