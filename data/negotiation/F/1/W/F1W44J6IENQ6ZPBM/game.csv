Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?,850000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $725000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $675000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $750000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering $675000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,6,
