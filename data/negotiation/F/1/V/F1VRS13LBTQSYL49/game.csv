"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really appreciate its value. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
