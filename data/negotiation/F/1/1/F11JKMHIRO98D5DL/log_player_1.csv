Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlighting the product's value to create a good impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid with the price and leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer. This shows flexibility and can lead to a mutually agreeable price.

**Important note:** This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is below my minimum price of $120. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, I believe I can get a better price. There's still potential for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if I don't reach a deal with Bob, I have a guaranteed $120 from John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still give me a fair price and allow me to make a sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $150 to $130, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the fair price and potential for a sale.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob doesn't agree to $130. I want to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price point.

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also that I'm not willing to accept a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum price of $120. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation stalled:** It seems like Bob is firm on his price, and further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **John's offer is a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.

It's time to secure the best possible deal.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and saves me further negotiation with Bob."
