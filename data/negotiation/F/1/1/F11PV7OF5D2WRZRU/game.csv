"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
