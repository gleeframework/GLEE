Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning listing the product publicly implies others might be interested, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
