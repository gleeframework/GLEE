"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, I'm still quite far off from where I'd need to be to make a deal.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're still quite far apart in our valuations. I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $1,300,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
