"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be open to $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll be getting from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, $925,000 is a bit too close to my limit. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $900,000.  It's a strong offer, and I think it would benefit us both to avoid further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $925,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $915,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
