**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on $125 and is unlikely to go much lower. While $125 is within your budget, buying from John for $150 sets a clear upper limit and prevents further potentially fruitless negotiation.  You're guaranteed to get the product without the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and potentially missing out."
