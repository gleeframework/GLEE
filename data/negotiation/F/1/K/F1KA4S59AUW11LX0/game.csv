"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That would be a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. It's closer, but we're still a bit apart. How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're willing to go that high.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
