"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I will counteroffer.  I will not sell the product to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try to reach a deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. It's closer, but we're still a bit apart. How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know if you're willing to go that high."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
