"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would like to propose a price of $750,000. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $750000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $825,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  This would allow us to both close the deal and maintain a fair price for both parties.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $815000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very close to Bob's absolute limit, but she's still not willing to go down to $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation.  While there's a chance Alice might eventually come down to Bob's price, there's also a risk she won't.  Buying from John guarantees a known price within Bob's budget."
