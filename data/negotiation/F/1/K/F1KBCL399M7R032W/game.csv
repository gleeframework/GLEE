"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product but would like to propose a price of $750000. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the sale. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $750000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $825000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit.  This would allow us to both close the deal and maintain a fair price for both parties.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $815000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.
