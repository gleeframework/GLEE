"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $800,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $630,000?",630000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $680,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",680000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  You're right, this product is valuable to me and I want to make a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll sell it to you for $670,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",670000.0,Alice,7,
