,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $10,875. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John.",10875.0,Alice,5,
