Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better deal.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
