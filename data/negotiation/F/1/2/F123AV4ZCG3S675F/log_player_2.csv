"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you don't know the product's value to Alice, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a strong initial counteroffer, leaving room for compromise while still being significantly lower than Alice's original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still not a price I'm willing to accept.  I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $12,000. This is a more aggressive move than my previous counteroffer but still leaves room for compromise. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable offer, and we can close the deal soon."
