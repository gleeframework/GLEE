"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum value of $12,000 and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm also emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us, which could encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant discount. I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to close this deal, I think we're close!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept at this point, and I'm expressing my confidence in reaching an agreement.  I'm trying to create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
