"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $850000. This is a significant price reduction and shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for us.  Let's keep this conversation going.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $750000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a solution.  While $750000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring I can achieve my minimum while you get the product at a reasonable cost.",800000.0,Alice,5,
