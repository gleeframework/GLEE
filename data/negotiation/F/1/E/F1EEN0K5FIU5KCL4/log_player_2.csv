"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm aiming for a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This still gives you a good profit, and it's a better deal for me. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $8,750 is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $1,250 compared to buying from John. 
* While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the potential savings are minimal and the risk of Alice walking away is higher."
