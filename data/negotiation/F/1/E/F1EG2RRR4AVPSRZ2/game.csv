"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value. However, $750,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original figure. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to stay close to your initial price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
