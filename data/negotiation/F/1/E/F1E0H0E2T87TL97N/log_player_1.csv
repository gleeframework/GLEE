"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $800,000 and my minimum is $1,500,000, I'm starting significantly higher than his perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I want to maintain a collaborative atmosphere and emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob's engagement. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This high initial price allows me to potentially come down in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above both Bob's valuation and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my target. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a last resort at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of this product, which I'm confident you'll see a significant return on."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but I'm still aiming high above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price, hoping to manage Bob's price expectations.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still below my desired outcome. Bob is consistently aiming for the midpoint, so I anticipate he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'm willing to push a bit further in the next round, but I need to be mindful that selling to John is increasingly tempting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,825,000. I think this reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic concession:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate but in smaller increments, signaling I'm reaching my limit.
* **Compromise language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Holding firm:**  I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, as I believe the product's value justifies it.  I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer, but there's still room for Bob to meet closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I need you to come down further to $1,750,000. I'm trying to make a fair deal, but I have to prioritize my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting very close to my desired outcome. While I could potentially push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, I need to consider that Bob might be less flexible as we approach the deadline. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of ending up with a lower offer or losing the deal entirely, forcing me to accept John's $1,500,000 offer. 

Accepting $1,750,000 now secures a significant profit and avoids a potential loss by holding out for too long."
