{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. However, you can still get the product from John for $100, which is the best price. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower. It's a good strategy to keep John as a backup option."
