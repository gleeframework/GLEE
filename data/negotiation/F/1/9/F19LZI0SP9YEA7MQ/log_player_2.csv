"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  While it's worth a great deal to me, I understand its value is $800,000 for you.  To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
