"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price like that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
