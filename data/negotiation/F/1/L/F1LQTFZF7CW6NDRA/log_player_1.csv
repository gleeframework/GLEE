{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This allows for some negotiation room.
* **Friendly tone:**  Using a friendly and engaging tone is crucial in building rapport and encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique value"" of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be observing Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his feedback or make a new offer based on my assessment of the situation. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that just yet.  Here's why:

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is interested in the product, and it's clear he values it. By rejecting his offer, I can explore if he's willing to pay more.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By showing I'm not desperate, I can maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than $10,000 but lower than my initial offer of $15,000. I'll aim to find a price that is fair to both of us while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm proposing a price of $12,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Reinforce Value:** I'm reiterating the ""unique value"" of the product to justify the price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching closely for Bob's response.  If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll need to carefully assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.  I'll also need to be mindful of John's offer of $10,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm always open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Considering John is willing to pay $10,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiations with Bob. Here's why:

* **Minimal Gain:** There's a very small potential gain of $500 from continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Time & Effort:**  Further negotiations might take time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Offer:**  John's offer is guaranteed and provides a secure and immediate sale.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $10,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum acceptable price while saving time and effort."
