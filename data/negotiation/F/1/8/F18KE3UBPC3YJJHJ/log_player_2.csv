"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to set a low anchor price, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He's aiming to leave room for negotiation while still staying within his budget.  It's possible Alice will reject this counteroffer, but Bob is willing to risk it to try to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but Bob is still trying to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  He still has the option to buy from John for $15,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the product for as close to his budget as possible. He's proposing a price that's halfway between his last offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This could be a good deal for both parties."
