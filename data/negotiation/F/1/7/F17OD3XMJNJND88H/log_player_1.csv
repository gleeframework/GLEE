Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. I believe this is a fair price that Bob may be willing to accept, given his estimated value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
