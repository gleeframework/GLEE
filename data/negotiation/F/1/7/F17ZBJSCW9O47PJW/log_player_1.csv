Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe its value far exceeds $8,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high.  Offering a price of $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a profit above your minimum.
* **Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, you incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies you're open to discussion. If Bob negotiates, you can potentially settle on a price between $12,000 and $14,000.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
