{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a decent markup on my minimum value of $10,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price right away.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. It's a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a little more profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to get $10,500. It's worth it to me to avoid further negotiation and close the deal."
