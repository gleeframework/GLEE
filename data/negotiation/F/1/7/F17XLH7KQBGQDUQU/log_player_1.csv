{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's worth at least $130.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which is within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's not worth risking the deal to continue negotiating.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the minimum value for my product and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
