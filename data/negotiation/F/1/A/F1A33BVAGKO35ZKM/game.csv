"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. Would you be interested?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet on a price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than $155. I can offer it to you for $162. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",162.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $162 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $158?",158.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more on this sale. I can offer it to you for $165 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus that's not included in the original price. This way, you'll get a better deal than you would at $158. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the bonus you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160?",160.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $165, but I'll tell you this: if you're willing to meet me at $165, I'll throw in a second bonus on top of the first one, making it a total of two exclusive perks. This is my final offer. What do you say?",165.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've decided to walk away from the deal. I'm not willing to pay more than $120 for this product. I think I'll go with John's offer instead.",120.0,Bob,10,
