Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I think you're underestimating the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very slowly coming down in price and it's unlikely she'll reach a price you'd prefer over John's offer in the remaining rounds.  Buying from John guarantees you save the most money."
