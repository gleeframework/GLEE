"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $135 is still within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to Alice."
