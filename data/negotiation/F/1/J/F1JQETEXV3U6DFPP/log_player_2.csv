"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a very good price, but it's still early in the negotiation. There's a strong chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since you haven't revealed your maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start exploring potential counteroffers and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially create a larger gap for further bargaining.  While $250,000 is a very low price, it's still within the realm of possibility given that my maximum budget is $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $350,000 is a much better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me at this stage. I'm confident I can push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to accept her price.  $300,000 seems like a fair middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $325,000 is a good price considering my budget.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lower the price further, but there's also a risk that Alice will become frustrated and refuse to budge.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing the deal entirely."
