"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but $900,000 is still too far from what I have budgeted.  Could you consider $700,000? I believe that would be a fair deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I can see that you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $750,000? That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
