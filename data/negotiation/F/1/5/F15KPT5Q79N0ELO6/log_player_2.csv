"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to reach a price closer to his target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.  Would you consider a price of $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price, but Alice's offer is still $75,000 above it.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if Alice is willing to come down further. Bob should try to counter with a lower price, aiming to close the gap even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to accept $1,060,000?  This is a great deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,060,000, which is $1,067,500. This is my final offer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,067,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,067,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,067,500 is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, Bob has only 3 rounds left.  The risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and potentially running out of time is too high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 and secure the product within his budget."
