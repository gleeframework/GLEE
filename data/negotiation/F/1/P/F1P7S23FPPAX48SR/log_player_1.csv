Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can go up to $12,000, so there's potential to get closer to Bob's value.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By not asking for the full $12,000, you signal you're open to discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
