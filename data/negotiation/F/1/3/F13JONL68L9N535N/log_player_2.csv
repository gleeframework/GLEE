"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll get the deal done."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $87.50 is below Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $100.
* **It's a good compromise:**  Alice has moved from her initial $90 offer, and Bob is likely to get a better deal than buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more or losing the deal altogether."
