Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He gets it for $300,000 less than its worth to him, and I make a profit above my guaranteed sale price.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a touch of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
