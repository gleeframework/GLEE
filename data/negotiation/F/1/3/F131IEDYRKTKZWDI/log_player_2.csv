$200 is way over your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

We're getting closer to our limit.  Let's try a price just below our absolute maximum, and see if Alice will come down to meet us."

While $160 is tempting, it's still higher than our target.  It's worth pushing for a better deal before resorting to John."

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice might be too risky, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. John is offering a price that is within our budget, so it's the safest option at this point."
