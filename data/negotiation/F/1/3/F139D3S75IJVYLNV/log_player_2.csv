"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob could get from John. Bob should reject the offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  Let's close the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to get closer to my target price.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find common ground this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,000 is getting closer to his target, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. There's room for further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference and settle at $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're getting close, but I still need to be a little closer to my desired price. Would you consider $9,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can close the deal this round.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still too high for Bob. He has only 3 rounds left and should buy from John for $8,000 to secure the product at the best possible price. There's a significant risk of not finding a mutually agreeable price with Alice in the remaining rounds."
