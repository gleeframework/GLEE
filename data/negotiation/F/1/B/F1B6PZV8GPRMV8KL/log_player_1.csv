Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to the product's worth to Bob as possible. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $115 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm meeting Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower than $115. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John in the next round."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close, but I'm running out of time and don't want to risk him rejecting my counteroffer again. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, even though it's less than I'd prefer."
