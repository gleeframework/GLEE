"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly lower.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go higher before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75, so I'll offer it to you for $82.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high. Bob can likely push for a lower price in subsequent rounds. He should continue negotiating with Alice as long as it's within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $81, which is just a small increase from your offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $81 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $80, making it a good deal.
* **Limited time:** There are only 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Even if Bob accepts, there's still room for a small counteroffer in future rounds if Alice is amenable.  But the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential savings."
