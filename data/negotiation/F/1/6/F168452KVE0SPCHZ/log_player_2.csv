**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price from Alice. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $11,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows me to profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's first offer, you can still potentially get a lower price. You're still within your budget and can continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price of $10,500."
