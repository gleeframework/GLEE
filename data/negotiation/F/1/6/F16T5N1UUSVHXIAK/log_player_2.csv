"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  While you could buy from John for $800,000, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal with Alice.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above my maximum budget. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high.  While it's tempting to accept and save some time, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price.  We've only had 3 rounds, and I have 7 more to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still within my budget and is a good middle ground between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my maximum budget. It's worth accepting this offer, as it's only $20,000 over my limit.  Continuing to negotiate might take several more rounds, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a lower price.  It's better to secure the product now and avoid the risk of losing it to another buyer."
