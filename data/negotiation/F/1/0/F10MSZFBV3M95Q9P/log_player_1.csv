Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $160. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting at $160 leaves room for negotiation. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't seem outrageously high. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests Alice is open to discussing the price.  If Bob counters, Alice can still negotiate down closer to his $120 valuation while making a profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $120, meeting her minimum price."
