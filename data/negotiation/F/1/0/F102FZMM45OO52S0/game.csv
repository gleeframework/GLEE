"Alice, while I see the potential of this product, $2,300,000 is simply too high for me.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $2,300,000 represented my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to be flexible.  Considering your perspective, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a fairer balance.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
