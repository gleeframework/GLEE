Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes value and willingness, which might make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit."
