"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still lower than the price John is offering.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $30 compared to buying from John."
