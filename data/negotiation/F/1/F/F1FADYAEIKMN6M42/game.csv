"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
