"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget. It also allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $115, which is a reasonable price and saves you $5 compared to John's offer. There's a risk Alice might not go any lower, and you could end up paying more or missing out on the deal altogether if you continue negotiating."
