Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 105}
