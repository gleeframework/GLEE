Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a margin for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept immediately.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A price closer to $150 might make Bob feel pressured to accept right away, potentially limiting your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a good price, it's still below my initial offer of $140 and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, I'm still hoping for $135. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
