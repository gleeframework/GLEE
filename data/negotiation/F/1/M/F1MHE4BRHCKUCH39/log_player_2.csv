"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at the price of $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to me, so paying $150 is not a good deal. I'll look for a better price elsewhere.
