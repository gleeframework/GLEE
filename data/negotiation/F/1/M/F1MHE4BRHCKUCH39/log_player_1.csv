Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at the price of $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $150 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The message aims to sound confident about the product's value while still inviting Bob's opinion, which may give you insights into his willingness to pay.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price he might find acceptable."
