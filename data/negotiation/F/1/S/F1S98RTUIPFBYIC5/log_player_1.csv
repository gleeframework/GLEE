Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both Alice and Bob, aiming high allows for potential negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,500,000 allows for Bob to counter-offer and still land within a range that's profitable for Alice. 
* **Confident Language:** Using positive and confident language can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the initial offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit. It's essential to consider Bob's personality and negotiation style for real-world application."
