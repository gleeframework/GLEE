"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for this valuable product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's try to find a compromise closer to that figure.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this valuable product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
