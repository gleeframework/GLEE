# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for this valuable product.
