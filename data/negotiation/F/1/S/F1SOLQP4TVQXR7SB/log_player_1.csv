"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still showing flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $9000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has clearly indicated his firm stance on the price.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum,  I've already rejected his offer once and I'm not confident he'll budge further.  Given that I can secure $10,000 from John, it's wiser to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
