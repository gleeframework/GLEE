{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very special product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.  It also opens the conversation with a focus on the potential value, which might pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $700,000, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but this product is truly unique, and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in your hands.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still give you a significant potential for profit, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $900000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to sell for that price. I believe there's a chance I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll counteroffer again, but if he rejects this, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. While $900,000 is getting closer to what I need,  I'm still not quite there yet.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it has the potential to be worth more to you than $900,000.  How about we settle at $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $850000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to make more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable opportunity."
