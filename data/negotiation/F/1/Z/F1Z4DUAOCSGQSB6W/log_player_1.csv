Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm asking for $20,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $20,000, it implies the product's value and uniqueness, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more depending on its perceived value and his need for it.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer is just the beginning. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy in mind for how you will respond."
