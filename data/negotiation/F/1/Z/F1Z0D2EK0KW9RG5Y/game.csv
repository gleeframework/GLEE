"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. To demonstrate my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,400,000. This is my top price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
