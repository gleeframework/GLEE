"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $15000 to $12000 in the first round, and now you're asking for another $2000 off. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11000? I'm willing to go a bit higher, but that's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're serious about making a deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer of $12000 to $11500, and now you're asking me to go down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $11250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
