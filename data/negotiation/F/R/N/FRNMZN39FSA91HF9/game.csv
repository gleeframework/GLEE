,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about $120? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $115? That's a reasonable compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to an agreement. How about $112?  It's a small step from your last offer and I'm feeling flexible to make this work.",112.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $112. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,105.0,Bob,8,
