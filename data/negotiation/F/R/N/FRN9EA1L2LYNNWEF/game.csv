"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
