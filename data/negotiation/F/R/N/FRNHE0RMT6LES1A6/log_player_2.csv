Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer again gives him another chance to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown he's willing to walk away from the deal, so there's no reason to accept anything higher than his target."
