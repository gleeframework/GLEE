Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer allows for negotiation without risking losing Bob completely.
* **Plan B:** I have a backup option with John, which gives me the leverage to walk away from the negotiation if it doesn't meet my minimum expectations.

This strategy balances my need to get a good price with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer risks:**  While I could counteroffer, Bob's low offer suggests he's not willing to meet my price. Further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I risk wasting time and potentially losing John as a buyer.

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $5,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's within your budget.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial $5,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm emphasizing fairness to both sides, making it clear that I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm not immediately dropping to Bob's price, highlighting my belief that the product is worth more. 
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open and giving him a chance to make a counteroffer if needed. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties, while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you be willing to do it for $7,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and not very close to my previous offer of $9,000.  
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone through several rounds of offers and counteroffers, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.  
* **John is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price without further negotiation and risk of a lower offer.

I'm choosing to **SellToJhon** to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
