"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it lower.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $650,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $650,000, which is a good price for me. While I'd love to get it lower, I'm concerned about losing out on the deal altogether. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at a higher price. I'll accept the offer and move forward."
