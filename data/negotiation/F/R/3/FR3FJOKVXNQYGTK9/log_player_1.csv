Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my  constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is significantly higher.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to finding a deal, but I can't go above $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it reflects a fair balance of our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear we're not going to reach a price that reflects the product's true value to me. John's offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on."
