"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above your budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful of Alice's offer but clearly states your budget limitations. 
* **Significant Counter:** The $8,000 counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price. It signals that you're serious about buying but need a price that works for you."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference at $9,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to your desired price.
* **Fairness Appeal:** By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" you aim to make the offer more appealing to Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and gives you room to potentially negotiate down a bit further, even if Alice rejects this specific price."
