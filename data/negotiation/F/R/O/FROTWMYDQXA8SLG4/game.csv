"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I understand that this might not reflect the full value you see in it, but I hope we can still come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
