Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I understand that this might not reflect the full value you see in it, but I hope we can still come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
