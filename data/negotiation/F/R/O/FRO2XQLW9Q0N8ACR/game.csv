"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
