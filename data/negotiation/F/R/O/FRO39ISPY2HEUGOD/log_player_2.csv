# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. Based on my assessment, its worth is no less than $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects its significant potential and the value it could bring to your business.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 doesn't quite meet the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1250000.  This price still allows you to benefit from its potential while acknowledging its inherent value. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still a little over my budget. However, it's very close to what John is offering. I want to see if I can negotiate a price closer to $1,200,000 before I commit to either option."
