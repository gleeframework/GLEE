{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also ensures you get a price significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price still gives you a significant discount, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a quicker sale and a higher profit than selling to John."
