"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we try $1,100,000? I think that's fair.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I still think we can do better than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. That's as low as I can go.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm feeling the pressure here. I need this to be my final offer. How about $1,150,000 and we have a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I can do $1,220,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
