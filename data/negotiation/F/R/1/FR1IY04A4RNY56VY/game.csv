"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
