"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, that price point is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $7,000. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and what John is offering. It's worth countering one more time."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $8,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $8,000. Would you consider $7,500?  That's a firm offer from my end."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get as close to $8,000 as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $7,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is down to $7,800, and she's indicated this is her final offer. While it's slightly above our target, it's a reasonable compromise and better than John's $8,000 price."
