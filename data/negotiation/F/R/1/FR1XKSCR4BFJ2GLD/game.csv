"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering your offer of $450,000, I'd like to counter with $550,000.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Could we possibly settle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,4,
