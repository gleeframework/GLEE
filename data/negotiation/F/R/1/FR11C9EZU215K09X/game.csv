"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? This would still leave you with a significant savings compared to the product's value to you, and it would be closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
