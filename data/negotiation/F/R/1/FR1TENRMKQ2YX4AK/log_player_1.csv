"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than your minimum ($1,200,000), increasing the likelihood of his engagement.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to initiate a collaborative negotiation by inviting Bob's thoughts and feedback. 
 
This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is substantial, it's still below my target price. I have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. Selling to John at this point would mean losing out on a potential $100,000 profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This considers both our valuations and moves us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price without being overly aggressive.
* **Positive Framing:** By framing the counteroffer as a step ""closer to a deal,"" it encourages Bob to continue the negotiation positively."
