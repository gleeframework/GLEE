"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a serious buyer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget considerations, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can we meet in the middle of that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you consider $13,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
