"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
