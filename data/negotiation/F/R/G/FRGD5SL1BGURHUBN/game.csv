"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $13,500 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $9,750. This is my final offer.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,750 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $7,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $8,500 is my absolute lowest price. This offer stands for 24 hours.",8500.0,Alice,5,
