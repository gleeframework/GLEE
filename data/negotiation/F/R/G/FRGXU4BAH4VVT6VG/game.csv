"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product though. How about $12000?  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
