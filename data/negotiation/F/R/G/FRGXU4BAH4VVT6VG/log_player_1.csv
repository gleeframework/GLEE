Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** $15,000 is a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  ""Open to negotiation"" signals flexibility and willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Plan B:** The threat of selling to John for $10,000 is a reminder that Bob needs to act quickly if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product though. How about $12000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth at least $10,000 to Alice. Accepting $12,000 would be a decent profit, but there's potential for more.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest, but also a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer gives Alice the opportunity to potentially get closer to her desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $10,000 is the safe option, but there's a chance of getting a better deal with Bob by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting her interests.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price, making it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Finality:**  The message suggests this is a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.  This could make him more likely to accept. 
* **Plan B:**  Alice is still aware of John's offer, so she's not desperate to sell to Bob. This helps her maintain a strong negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $12,500 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** The negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob's interest altogether and being stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from another round of negotiation is small, while the risk of losing the deal altogether is significant."
