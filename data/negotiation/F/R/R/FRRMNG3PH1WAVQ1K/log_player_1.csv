{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $110 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have John as a backup who will buy it for $80, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines."
