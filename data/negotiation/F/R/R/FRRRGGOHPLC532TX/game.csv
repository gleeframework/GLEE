"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider coming down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we're not willing to go as low as $600,000. We're willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we're not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. We're willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $850,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you do $780,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, we're not willing to go as low as $780,000. We're willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $780,000, which would be $815,000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",815000.0,Alice,7,
