"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a good price.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
