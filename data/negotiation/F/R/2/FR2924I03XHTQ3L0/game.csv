"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's still a great price for you, and it gets us both closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $9000. I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me at that price?,8200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8200 is still a little too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8750? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
