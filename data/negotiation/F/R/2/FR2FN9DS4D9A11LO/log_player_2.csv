"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's worth $100 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, you can likely get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her product is only worth $80 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
