Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit more, but it's still above my minimum threshold, so I'm not losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,000 above my minimum price and a good compromise after a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer is a good choice to secure a sale and earn a decent profit."
