"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $12,000, which is a price that's fair for both of us.  It's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
