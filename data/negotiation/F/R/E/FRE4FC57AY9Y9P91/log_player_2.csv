"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than John's price of $800,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to his target, he can likely get it for even less.  He has already shown Alice he's willing to walk away, so she might be more inclined to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, he's already come down significantly from Alice's initial price. At this point, $890,000 is a good price, only $90,000 more than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, especially if Alice is firm on this price. It's a calculated risk, but it's more likely to save Bob some money than potentially losing out on a good deal by trying to negotiate further."
