I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still a good price for me, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will meet me somewhere in the middle."
