"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $150. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $175. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $162.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",162.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $162.50. I'm thinking of a price of $168. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",168.0,Alice,5,
