"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a special offer of $100 for it. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product worth more than what you're paying, considering its actual value is $80 to you. I'm confident this price will be attractive and beneficial for you. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims the product's value to you is $80, you know it's worth no more than that and you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $80 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than necessary."
