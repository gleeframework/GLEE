"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a great deal, encouraging Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll be mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not desperate.  John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer.
* I'll continue to assess the situation and adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses.
* I'll keep in mind John's offer as a fallback option, especially if the negotiation starts to drag on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. Let's try to reach a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $950,000 is a fair middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing reaching a deal in this round to keep the pressure on.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, we have a deal.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping John's offer in mind.
* I'll continue to be mindful of the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk of not getting a better offer, and the possibility of losing time. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quicker sale and avoids the potential for more negotiation rounds that could result in a lower price or a no-deal scenario.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll proceed with the sale to Bob. 
*  While I'm happy with the deal, I'll keep an eye on future opportunities for similar products to potentially get closer to my desired price point."
