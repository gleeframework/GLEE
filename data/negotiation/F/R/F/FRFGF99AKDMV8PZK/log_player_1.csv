"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's close to my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the $100 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100 from John, it's still significantly less than my desired profit. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a price that's profitable for me. I hope this will entice Bob to accept the offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $125 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good profit and higher than the $100 John is offering. I've reached a point where I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing out entirely."
