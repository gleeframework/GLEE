Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product which I believe you'll find valuable for $119. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to your minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you get a price very close to your minimum if he accepts outright.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer ($120) if Bob declines. 

By starting high but just below your guaranteed sale price, you maximize your potential profit while still making the offer somewhat appealing to Bob."
