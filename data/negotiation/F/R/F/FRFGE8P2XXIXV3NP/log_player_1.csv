Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a fair compromise. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he will meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
