"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible to negotiate closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000? I believe we can find a fair solution.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product. How about we meet halfway at $1,550,000? This offer represents a significant reduction on my part and would be a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a fair compromise. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget.
