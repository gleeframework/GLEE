"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
