"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let's keep the negotiations going."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,500,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to take the risk of potentially losing this deal, but I'm determined to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm closer to my desired price, it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet me in the middle. It's getting risky to continue this negotiation as the rounds are getting limited. I believe it's in my best interest to sell to John for $1,500,000 and secure my desired profit."
