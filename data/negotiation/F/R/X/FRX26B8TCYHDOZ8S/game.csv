"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.  Let's keep the negotiations going.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
