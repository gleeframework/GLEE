Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120 and leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he should be willing to pay at least this much, and I can potentially get closer to that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum price, but I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his last offer.  It's still a good price for me, and I hope it's tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my desired price point and is a good deal for me. It's also higher than what John is willing to pay.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
