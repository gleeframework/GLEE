"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $20,000, I have a buffer to come down in price during subsequent rounds if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will give me insight into Bob's perception of the product's value and his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($8,000), indicating there's room for negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $12,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting and countering, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider $17,000. This reflects the true value and the benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer of $20,000 to $17,000. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the higher price, anchoring it to ""market value"" and potential benefits for Bob's business. This adds weight to my counteroffer.
* **Midpoint Strategy:**  This counteroffer falls between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, encouraging him to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is above my absolute minimum of $15,000.
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the difference is unlikely to be substantial. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing Bob further risks him walking away, leaving me to sell to John for $15,000. 

Taking the $14,000 now is a pragmatic decision, balancing profit with the potential risks of continued negotiation."
