Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you consider that?

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000).  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better deal, and it risks a stalemate.  It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting bogged down in further negotiation with Bob."
