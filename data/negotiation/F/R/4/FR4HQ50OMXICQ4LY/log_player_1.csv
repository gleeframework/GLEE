{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm also adding a friendly message to make the offer feel more personal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $12,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  That's a fair price that's still within my range.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11750}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm also trying to frame the price as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11750 is still a bit more than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to pay $11600. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,600 is still below my minimum value of $12,000, it's very close. I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because:

* **Close to the minimum:** It's only $400 below my minimum, which is a relatively small difference considering the initial price difference.
* **Potential for future deals:**  If Bob is happy with this deal, he might be more likely to buy from me again in the future at a higher price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would be a sure $12,000, I prefer to keep negotiating with Bob for a potential future relationship.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy to maximize profit in the long run."
