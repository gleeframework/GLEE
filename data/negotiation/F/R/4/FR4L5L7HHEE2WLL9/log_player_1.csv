{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $110 is higher than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **It's below my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **It's a reasonable offer:** $110 is a fair starting point, and it allows for potential negotiation without going too high or too low. 

I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $90 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 I can get from John. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  How about we split the difference at $97.50?  That way we both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $97.50, but I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $92 is still too low.  It's not worth further negotiation at this point.  I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid the risk of getting a lower price from Bob."
