"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I receive a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to drop the price slightly to $1,400,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price. It's important to continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his target.  While $1,400,000 is better than the initial offer, Bob can still save money by continuing the negotiation."
