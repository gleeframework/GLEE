"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup option at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $16,500, which is only $500 less than my initial offer and is a very good price.  It's closer to my ideal price and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the deal."
