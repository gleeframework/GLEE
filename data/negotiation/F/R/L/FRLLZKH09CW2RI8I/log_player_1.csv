Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin, but I'm still open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or cutting my losses and selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price to $135. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a fair compromise for Bob. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial counteroffer, and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and earn a profit while minimizing the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
