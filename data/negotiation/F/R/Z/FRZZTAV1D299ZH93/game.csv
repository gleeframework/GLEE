"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're serious about closing the deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,100,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still out of my range.  I'm ready to close the deal at $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
