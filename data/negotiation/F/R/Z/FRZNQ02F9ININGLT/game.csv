"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $140 to make it worth my while. Can we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $140 is still higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle - how about $120? This would still give you a decent profit.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need $135 to make it worth my while. Can we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
