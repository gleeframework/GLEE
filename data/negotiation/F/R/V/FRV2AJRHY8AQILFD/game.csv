"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and believe a price of $900,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows you to recoup a significant portion of your value while still being within my price range.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,100,000 represents a fair price considering the value this product brings, I understand your budgetary concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent worth of the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  This would be a significant step closer to my budget and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about splitting the difference and settling at $987,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",987500.0,Alice,5,
