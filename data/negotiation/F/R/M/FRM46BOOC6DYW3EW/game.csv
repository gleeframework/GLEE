"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Alice, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $108. Would you be willing to consider a price of $106.50?",106.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a living. I can do $107, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or walk away.",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a living, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $106, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",106.0,Bob,8,
