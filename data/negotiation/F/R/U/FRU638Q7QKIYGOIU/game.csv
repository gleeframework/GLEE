"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $140 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $145 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $150?  It's my minimum price, and it's fair considering the value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",150.0,Alice,7,
