"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's keep talking.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's make this happen.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000, I'll also ask you to throw in some additional support and training to ensure I get the most out of the product. Can we discuss the details of the support and training?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desire for additional support and training,  I'm not able to include those in the price at this time.  However, I'm willing to compromise on the price itself. How about we settle on $1,210,000? It's a fair price that bridges the gap between our offers and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",1210000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,200,000, I'll also agree to a 6-month maintenance contract, which will ensure that you continue to receive revenue from the product. Can we discuss the details of the maintenance contract?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
