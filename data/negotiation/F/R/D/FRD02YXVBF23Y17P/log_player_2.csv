# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and your budget constraints. Let's make this happen.
