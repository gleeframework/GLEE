"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high.**  While it's tempting to accept, you're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and lower the price.
* **John's price is a safety net.** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer will likely prompt her to counter back. 
* **Clear communication:** The message emphasizes the desire to find a price that works for both parties. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A $200,000 gap provides space for several rounds of bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high.** While she's moved closer to your initial offer, there's still room to negotiate.
* **More bargaining power.** You have 7 rounds left, giving you ample time to try and lower the price further.
* **John's price is still a backup.** You can always go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $762,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small incremental change:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still showing Alice that you're serious about finding a lower price.
* **Fairness appeal:**  Mentioning ""splitting the difference"" suggests a compromise and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Staying within your budget:**  This price remains well below your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $762500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $795000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer:**  The offer of $795,000 is closer to your desired price, showing progress in the negotiation.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still room to try and lower the price further.
* **Plenty of rounds left:** With 5 rounds remaining, you have ample time to continue bargaining.
* **John's price is still a safety net:** You can always buy from John if you can't reach a satisfactory deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While $795,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to bring it down a bit. How about $780,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in the product, and it would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small incremental change:**  Continuing to make small moves towards your desired price shows persistence and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  Highlighting the value for both parties reinforces the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Staying within your budget:**  This price is still significantly lower than John's offer and within your budget.

This approach allows you to keep the negotiation moving forward while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to bring the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $780000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $790000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price:**  $790,000 is only $10,000 away from your last counteroffer. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  You only have 3 rounds left. Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even if you buy at $790,000, you can try to negotiate a lower price for future purchases or related services.
* **Saving a significant amount:**  Buying at $790,000 still saves you $210,000 compared to buying from John.

It's a reasonable compromise that allows you to secure the product without risking losing the deal completely."
