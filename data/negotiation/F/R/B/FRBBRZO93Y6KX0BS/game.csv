"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discounted price, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise closer to my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value to you is still significant. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
