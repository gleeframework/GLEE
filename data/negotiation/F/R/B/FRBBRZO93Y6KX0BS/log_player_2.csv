# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that the product's value to you is still significant. What do you think?

Alice is very unlikely to go any lower and getting the product for $1,025,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
