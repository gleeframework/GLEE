Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
```

Bob is making a final push, offering $14,750. This is a significant increase from his previous offer and  shows his seriousness about buying the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. This is the final round, and even though Alice's offer is $100 less than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There's a risk that Alice might reject his final counteroffer, and he wouldn't be able to get the product at a lower price.  It's better to secure the product at a known price from John, even if it's slightly higher than his ideal."
