Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,000,000 gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, so you're still leaving yourself room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows confidence and sets the tone for a negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. It's more advantageous to accept his offer and secure the sale than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for a slightly higher price.  The potential for further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, and I'd rather secure a guaranteed sale at this point."
