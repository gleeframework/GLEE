"I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $12,750. This is a fair price for the value you'll be getting, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,500. Would you be willing to accept this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
