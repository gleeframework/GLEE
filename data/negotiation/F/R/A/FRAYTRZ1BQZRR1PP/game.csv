"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer, and it's still a solid price for you considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise and still leaves you a decent profit margin.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still not able to meet you at $1,300,000. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as it aligns better with my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,275,000. This allows both of us to walk away with a fair deal. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider $1,260,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and your original asking price. I hope this proposal will be acceptable.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
