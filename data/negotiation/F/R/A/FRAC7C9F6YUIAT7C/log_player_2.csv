"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit higher than Bob's preferred price point. He's still better off with John's offer, but there's still a chance he can get Alice's price down to $10,500.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,625.  This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  How about $10,687.50? This price is almost exactly halfway between our last two offers and would make a smooth transaction possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,687.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,687.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob has already reached his negotiation limit. He's willing to pay $10,500, and Alice is not budging much further.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at a lower price than continue negotiating with Alice and risk not getting a deal at all."
