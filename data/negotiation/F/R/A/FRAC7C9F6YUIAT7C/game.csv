"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This price is fair for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,750 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,625.  This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10625.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  How about $10,687.50? This price is almost exactly halfway between our last two offers and would make a smooth transaction possible.",10687.5,Alice,5,
