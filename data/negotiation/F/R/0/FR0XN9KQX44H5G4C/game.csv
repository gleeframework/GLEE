"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for an additional year. Considering the added value, I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. This is my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,7,
