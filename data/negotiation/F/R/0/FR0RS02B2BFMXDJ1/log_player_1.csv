Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
