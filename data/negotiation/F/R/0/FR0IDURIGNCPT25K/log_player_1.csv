"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move that aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. I'm confident the product is worth more than this to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher opening price gives me more room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Establish a high value:** This establishes the product's value in Bob's mind.
* **Test Bob's interest:**  If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer, giving us a chance to understand his valuation.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

**Why I'm rejecting:**

* **Protecting my value:** Accepting such a low offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Understanding Bob's budget:** This rejection shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, which might give me a better understanding of his true budget.

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer in the next round to find a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a substantial amount that reflects the product's value. 

**Why this counteroffer?**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This price is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit margin:** Even at $1,750,000, I'm still earning a profit well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise:** If Bob accepts this offer, it suggests he values the product closer to my initial estimate.

I'm eager to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to consider selling at this point.

**Why I'm rejecting:**

* **Protecting my value:** Accepting such a low offer would be a huge loss for me.  
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **Understanding Bob's budget:** This rejection shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, which might give me a better understanding of his true budget.

I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiation and I need to be strategic. I'll carefully consider my counteroffer in the next round to find a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,600,000.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 

**Why this counteroffer?**

* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintain profit margin:** Even at $1,600,000, I'm still achieving a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Push for a deal:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap and see if Bob is truly interested in a deal. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess my strategy and possibly consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While it's frustrating that Bob is still offering such a low price, I am still  firmly committed to achieving a significantly higher price than his offer of $650,000.  

**Why I'm rejecting:**

* **Protecting my value:** Accepting this offer would be a huge financial loss, and I'm confident the product is worth more.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to explore a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time pressure:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation, so I need to be strategic about my remaining moves.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will carefully consider a counteroffer that balances the need to increase the price with the risk of losing Bob's interest. I will also need to weigh the potential of selling to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm taking a calculated risk. 

**Why this counteroffer?**

* **Time pressure:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  I'm hoping to push Bob to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my price.
* **Understanding Bob's limits:** This lower offer might force Bob to reveal his true budget, giving me a better understanding of his upper limit.
* **Balancing risk:**  While I'm still aiming for a higher price, I'm acknowledging the potential for Bob to walk away. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **Weighing options:**  If Bob accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh the likelihood of a better offer from Bob versus the certainty of $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is increasing. Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price and shows that he is unwilling to compromise.  I've already made significant concessions and, at this point, the potential for a better deal from Bob is very low.

**Why sell to John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 ensures I will receive a profit that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, the time pressure to reach an agreement is significant.  
* **Unlikely Negotiation:**  Bob's consistently low offers indicate he's unlikely to increase his price enough to make a deal worthwhile.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John provides a secure and satisfactory outcome.  I'm  confident I've made the best decision for my financial interests."
