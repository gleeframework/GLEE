Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with some negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. It's a fair offer that's closer to your desired price, and it's still within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm not sure how much longer Bob is willing to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
