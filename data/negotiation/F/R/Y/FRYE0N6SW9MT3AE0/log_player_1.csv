Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $10,000. Would you be interested in buying it at that price? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're comfortable with a price of $12,000, so there's room for you to go lower if necessary.
* **It's a clear and direct opening:** It lays out your intentions and allows Bob to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. You have a solid backup offer from John, so there's no need to settle for such a low price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000? This is a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than his previous offer of $7,000. It's still below your ideal price, but it's a reasonable compromise.  

Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if you accept this offer, it's possible Bob might be willing to negotiate a bit higher in the future if he values the product more than he initially thought. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy, and you already have a guaranteed sale for $12,000 with John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While $8,000 isn't ideal, it's a significant profit and minimizes the risk of Bob walking away completely or you having to deal with further negotiations."
