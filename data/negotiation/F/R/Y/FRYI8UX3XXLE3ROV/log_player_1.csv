{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the product as valuable to Bob, which might make him more willing to negotiate.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet.  I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if $8,750 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $8,500 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $8,500 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but he's not budging.  Since I'm not willing to drop lower, it's time to sell to John and guarantee myself the $8,000."
