I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I have several rounds left to try and get closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I've already gone through 3 rounds and it doesn't seem like he's willing to budge much. I'm running out of time, and John is a sure thing. I'll take the $12,000 and move on."
