Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
