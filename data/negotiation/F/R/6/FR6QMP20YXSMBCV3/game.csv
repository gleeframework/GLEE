"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
