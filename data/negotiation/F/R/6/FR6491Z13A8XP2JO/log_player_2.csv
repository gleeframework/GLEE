"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price ($15,000).**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.** You have the advantage of knowing Alice's minimum price ($10,000) and can use that knowledge to your benefit."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your target price ($15,000).**  You're still trying to save money.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again.** You've established a range ($11,000 to $12,500) and can try to narrow the gap further. 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but you're trying to save as much as possible.**  You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
