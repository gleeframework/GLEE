Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the communication with a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a good price and above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or even a failed sale."
