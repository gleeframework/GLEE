"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
