{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I'm maximizing my potential profit while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to spend no more than $100 on this item. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a good price, I'm going to try to push for a higher amount. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more of what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm still trying to get a better price than $100, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and keep Bob engaged.  $110 is a compromise, and hopefully, it'll be enough to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $105 for this product. Could we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$105 is a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher.  It's close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
