"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers.  I believe its true value is even higher, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is willing to sell the product for. It's best to go with John's offer and save a significant amount of money."
