Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still reflects the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a great product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

You're still $1,500 over your budget.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product. Let's finalize this deal.

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay.  You can get the product from John for less, so it's time to move on."
