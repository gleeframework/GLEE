"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and the interest I've had in it, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Buying from John gets you the product at the best price."
