"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1600000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and it leaves room for a profitable agreement. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1600000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product, which is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I believe this price is in line with the value of the product for both of us, and it provides a good starting point for a final agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
