"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10000? This still gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to an agreement.

Alice's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price and you are still saving $2,000."
