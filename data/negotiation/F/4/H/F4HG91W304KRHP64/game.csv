"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
