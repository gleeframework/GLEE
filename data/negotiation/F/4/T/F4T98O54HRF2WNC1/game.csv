"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
