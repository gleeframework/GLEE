``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate, while also ensuring a good return for me. I'm hopeful that he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to counter-offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can push for a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500. This is a final offer, as I'm ready to move on to other buyers if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1162500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,160,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
