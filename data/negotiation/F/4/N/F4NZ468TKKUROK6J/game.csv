"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  That's still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get out of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. How about we settle at $875,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
