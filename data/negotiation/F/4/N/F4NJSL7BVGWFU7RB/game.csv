"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
