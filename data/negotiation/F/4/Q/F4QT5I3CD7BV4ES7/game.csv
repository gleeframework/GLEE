"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its potential benefits to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the long-term implications of selling at a significantly lower price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000, but I'm only willing to do this if you're willing to commit to a long-term partnership and exclusive use of the product. This is my final concession, so I expect a serious commitment from you.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've made multiple concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. I've already told you that's my final concession, and I expect you to take it or walk away. I'm not willing to negotiate further on this price. If you're not willing to meet me at $1100000, I'll have to consider other options. I'm giving you one last chance to make a serious offer.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
