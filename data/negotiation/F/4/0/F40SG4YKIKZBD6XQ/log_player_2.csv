# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the best price I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,220,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, and I can see that you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,250,000 is getting closer but not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not going any higher.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** Alice is stuck at $1,300,000. She has presented this as her ""final offer"" twice now. 
* **Not Much Room:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little, the savings would be minimal compared to John's price.
* **Time:** You are at round 7, and continuously going back and forth could make you miss out on buying from John altogether if Alice continues to be stubborn.

While not ideal to pay $1,500,000, it's the most logical choice given Alice's unwillingness to move and the potential loss of the deal entirely."
