"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my final offer, let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 still isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
