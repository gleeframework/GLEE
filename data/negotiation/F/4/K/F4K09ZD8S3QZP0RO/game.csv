"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for what you'll get.",110.0,Alice,5,

It's a one-time offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",115.0,Alice,7,
