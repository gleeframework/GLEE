"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000.  While that's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he'd like to pay even less, Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a substantial discount."
