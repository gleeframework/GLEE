"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This reflects the value you've expressed and allows me to consider your offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $875,000. This reflects the value you've placed on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll only go up to $825,000. That's the best I can do. Can you consider it?",825000.0,Bob,6,
