Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $200. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  I won't lose money if he rejects the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay closer to my desired price.

I'm willing to negotiate if Bob counters, but I'll always keep my minimum of $150 in mind."
