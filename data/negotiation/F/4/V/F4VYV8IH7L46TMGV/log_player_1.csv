Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a reason to negotiate but also acknowledges the product's worth. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **It's a round number:**  This makes it easier for Bob to quickly understand and respond to your offer.

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet her at $990,000. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counter again, but I'll need to be strategic. If he rejects my next offer, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $990,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

This offer is my absolute final offer. It's a compromise, but I'm sticking to my minimum.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John and avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on her final offer. I'd be willing to meet her at $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If she's not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk losing time and possibly ending up with a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself the best possible price."
