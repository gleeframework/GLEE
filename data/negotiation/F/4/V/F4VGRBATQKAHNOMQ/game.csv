"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price tag of $2000000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd need to see a figure closer to $1900000 to make this work. Let's find a price point that's fair for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $1825000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1825000.0,Bob,4,
