"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I want to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price ($8,000). I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This considers both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a slight improvement from her initial offer, but it's still above my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I believe I can still get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a good deal for me, and I believe Alice might be willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,900? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,900 is very close to my desired price and represents a significant concession from her. It's a good deal for me, and accepting avoids further negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price or a delay in securing the product."
