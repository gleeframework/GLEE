I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more enticing price for Bob, while also showing him that I'm serious about making a deal."

This is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get more from Bob.  I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale."
