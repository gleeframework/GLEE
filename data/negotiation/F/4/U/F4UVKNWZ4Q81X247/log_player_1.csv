Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if those aspects aren't explicitly defined.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the initial offer.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back-and-forth discussion and adjustments to the price."
