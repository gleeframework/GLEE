"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it would be a great fit. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $11,500, which is above your budget. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
