"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While it seems interesting, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
