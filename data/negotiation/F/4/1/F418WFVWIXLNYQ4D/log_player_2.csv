"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $95 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal by rejecting it. You know John will sell you the same product for $100.  This gives you room to negotiate with Alice or force her to lower her price closer to her own perceived value of $80."
