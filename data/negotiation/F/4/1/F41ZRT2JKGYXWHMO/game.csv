"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me is much higher than $14,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not convinced that $17,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product, and I think that's a reasonable compromise.",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $16,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $16,000, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $17,000. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $17,000. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $16,000, and I'm not budging from that price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Bob,10,
