"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
