"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her minimum, but it's still above your maximum. You can try to negotiate further, but it's risky. You should indicate that you are willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but if that's not workable, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're moving closer to Alice's valuation.
* **Sets a firm limit:**  $9,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, signaling a strong desire for the product while still staying under budget.
* **Introduces the possibility of walking away:** This lets Alice know you're serious and have alternatives, putting a bit of pressure on her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500, and you've signaled your willingness to walk away. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000. This ensures you get the product without exceeding your budget."
