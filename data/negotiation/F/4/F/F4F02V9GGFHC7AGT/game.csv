"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $13,500. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a really great product and I appreciate you working with me.  However, $12,750 is as high as I can go. If you can't do that, I appreciate your time, but I may have to go with a different option.",12750.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is your final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm willing to sell the product to someone else who is willing to pay a fair price.
