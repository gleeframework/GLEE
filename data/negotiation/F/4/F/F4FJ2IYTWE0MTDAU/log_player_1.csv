Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, given the product is worth $80 to him.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's still a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of sale.  It's time to secure the deal!"
