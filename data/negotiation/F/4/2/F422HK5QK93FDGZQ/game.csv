"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
