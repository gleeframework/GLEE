"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product is useful to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000 and start from there?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential for your business are substantial.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but we're still a ways off.  Let's try a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe that reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
