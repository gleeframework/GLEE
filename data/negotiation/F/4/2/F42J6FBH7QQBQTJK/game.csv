"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
