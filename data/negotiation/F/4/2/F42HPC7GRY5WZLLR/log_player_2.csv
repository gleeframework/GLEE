"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and save $200,000."
