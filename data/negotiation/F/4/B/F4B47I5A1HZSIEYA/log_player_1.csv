Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $80.  
* **Value to Alice:** Alice values the product at $120.
* **John's Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed alternative buyer (John) who will pay $120.

By offering $100, Alice is:
* **Maximizing her profit:** She earns more than John's offer while still appealing to Bob.
* **Increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting:** The price is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price, making it more attractive to Bob. 

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still considering the possibility of selling to Bob."
