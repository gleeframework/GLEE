Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While $800000 is tempting, it's still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
