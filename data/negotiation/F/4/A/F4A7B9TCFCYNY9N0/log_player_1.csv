{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him room to negotiate. 
* The message is friendly and encouraging. 
* I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking what he thinks.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.
* I have a backup plan of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. 
* I'm aiming for a price as close to $12,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer** is the best strategy at this point.  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price.
* While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a significant drop in price just yet. 
* By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, and potentially get a better outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low.  I present my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts.  I'm also prepared to make another counteroffer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have a guaranteed sale to John for that amount, so there's no reason for me to settle for a price that's so far below my value. 

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
