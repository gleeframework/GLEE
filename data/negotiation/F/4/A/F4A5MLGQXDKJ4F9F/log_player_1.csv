Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
