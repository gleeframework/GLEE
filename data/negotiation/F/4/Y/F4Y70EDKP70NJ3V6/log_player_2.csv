{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Alice's offer is way too high.**  It's well above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **There's no point in accepting.** You'd lose a significant amount of money.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows for negotiation.**  You have a chance to bring the price down closer to your acceptable range."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Start low:** I'm offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to pay, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Clear signal:**  This counteroffer clearly communicates my budget constraints and shows Alice I'm serious about a deal, but only within a reasonable price range."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my budget.** While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still $6,000 more than I'm willing to pay.
* **Continuing to negotiate is still advantageous.** By rejecting and counteroffering, I can keep pushing for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to work towards a deal.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  But I'm not desperate yet, and there's a chance I can get a better deal with Alice."

```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still too high.**  While $14,500 is a significant drop from the initial offer, it's still outside my budget and I can likely do better.
* **Negotiation is still promising.**  We've made progress, and with more rounds left, I can continue to push for a lower price. 
* **John remains a safety net.** I can still buy from him if the negotiation falls apart, but I'm not in a rush to do so yet."

* **There's still room to negotiate.**  With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is mounting, but I can still try to get closer to my target price.
* **Buying from John remains a backup plan.** If negotiations stall, I can always go with John. However, I'm still hopeful I can secure a better deal with Alice."

Round 8

{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is close to my price.**  Her offer is only $3,750 over my budget, which is a significant reduction from the initial offers.
* **Only one round left.**  There's a good chance I might not get a better deal in the last round.  It's risky, but accepting this offer is a calculated risk.
* **John is still an option.** If I regret accepting this offer, I can always buy from John later. However, the potential savings of $3,750 are tempting."
