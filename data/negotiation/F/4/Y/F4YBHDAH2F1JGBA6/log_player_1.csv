{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also a good price for Bob since he values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get a better deal by countering.  There's still room to negotiate upwards, and Bob clearly sees value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives you a great price, and it's still a fair deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe there's room for a lower price. I would like to propose $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is just above your minimum of $8,000. It's a good deal considering he's been reluctant to budge much further. Selling to John would only yield you $8,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
