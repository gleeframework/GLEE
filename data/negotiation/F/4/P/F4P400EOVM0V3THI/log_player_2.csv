"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above my desired price range. I have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is enticing, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is within my acceptable range.  While I'd prefer a lower price, the risk of negotiating further and potentially having her reject my offer again, or worse, having to buy from John for $1,200,000, outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll take the deal at $900,000."
