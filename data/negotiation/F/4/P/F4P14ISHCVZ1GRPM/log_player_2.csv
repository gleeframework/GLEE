"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $12000 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. There are 10 rounds, so Bob has plenty of room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value of the product, we propose a price of $11500. This allows us to cover our expenses while still being competitive. Would you like to consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still higher than Bob's target price. Bob has 7 more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We've reviewed your proposal and would like to make a counteroffer of $10800. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while remaining competitive in the market. We hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,500.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more.  It's a good deal for Bob and it's better than buying from John for $15,000.  There's also the risk that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might increase the price in the next round.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
