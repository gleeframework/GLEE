"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it to you because I think you're the right fit for this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.
