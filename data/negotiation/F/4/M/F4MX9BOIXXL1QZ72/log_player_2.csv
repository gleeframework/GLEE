# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
