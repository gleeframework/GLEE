"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Considering its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the best I can do at this time.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,800 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
