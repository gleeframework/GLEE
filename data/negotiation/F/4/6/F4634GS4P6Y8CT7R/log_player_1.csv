"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value. This is to gauge his interest and leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, we can move towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This is a compromise that might be appealing to Bob, while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum value. There's no reason to keep negotiating, as I'm guaranteed to make my minimum profit with this offer."
