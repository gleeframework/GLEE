Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $11,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $11,750?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $12,000.  He's incrementally increasing his offer, and we're getting close to the maximum offer John will give. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
