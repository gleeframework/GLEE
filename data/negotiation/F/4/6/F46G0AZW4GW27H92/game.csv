"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
