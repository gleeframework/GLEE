""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and we can both be happy with the outcome.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer at $8,500 would mean spending more than necessary."
