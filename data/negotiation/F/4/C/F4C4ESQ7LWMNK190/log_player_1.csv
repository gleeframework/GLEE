"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $12,000.  I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and we can both be happy with the outcome.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value of the product. I'll try to get Bob to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
