"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and we can both be happy with the outcome.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
