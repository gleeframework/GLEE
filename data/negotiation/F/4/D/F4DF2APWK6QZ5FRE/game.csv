"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. Would you be interested in purchasing the product at this price?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you at $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",10000.0,Alice,5,
