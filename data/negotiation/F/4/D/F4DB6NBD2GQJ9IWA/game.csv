"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,400,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
