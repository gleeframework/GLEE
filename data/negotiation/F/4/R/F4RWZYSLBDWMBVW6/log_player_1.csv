"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement.  There's still a chance for a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is another compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's offer while still leaving room for a potential agreement. I'm hoping that we can find a common ground before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm going to continue negotiating, as I believe there's potential to get closer to my target price.  We still have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to accept an offer that's significantly lower than my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, showing my eagerness to reach a deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, but I'm also prepared to consider John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time. Bob's offers are consistently below my desired price point, and it's becoming clear that we may not reach a mutually acceptable agreement. To ensure I secure a reasonable sale, I'm going to accept John's offer of $800,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and guarantees a sale."
