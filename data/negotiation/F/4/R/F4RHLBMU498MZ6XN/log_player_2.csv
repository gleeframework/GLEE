"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 rounds left, which gives him plenty of time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure it aligns with our company's pricing strategy. Therefore, I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible.  While $13,500 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation and Bob has 7 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and ensuring you get a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. After reviewing our costs and profit margins, I am willing to consider $13,250 as a compromise. This price ensures a reasonable return while still being competitive with market standards. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price range.  While a slight increase from his last offer, $13,250 is still cheaper than John's offer. With only 5 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is becoming less likely.  At this point, accepting the offer makes sense to secure the product at a reasonable price."
