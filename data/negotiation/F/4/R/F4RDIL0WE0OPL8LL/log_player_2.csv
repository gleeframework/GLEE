Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with. You might be able to get a slightly better deal by making another counteroffer."
