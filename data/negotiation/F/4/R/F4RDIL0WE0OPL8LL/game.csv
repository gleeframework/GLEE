"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find common ground!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?  This would allow us both to get a good deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
