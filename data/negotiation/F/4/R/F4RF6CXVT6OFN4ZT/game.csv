"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, reflecting its value and my own financial constraints.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10500 is closer to my budget, I'm still limited.  I'm happy to offer $9500.  It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my financial limitations.",9500.0,Bob,4,
