{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $58 is getting closer to my ideal price range.  I'm confident that I can't get a significantly lower price from Alice at this point, and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting her offer is the best way to ensure I get the product and save money compared to buying from John."
