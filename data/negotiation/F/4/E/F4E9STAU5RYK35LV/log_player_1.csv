{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm also setting a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $14,000? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $15,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $15,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $15,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely we won't get closer.  It's a good deal for me considering the potential of further negotiation being lengthy and possibly leading to a sale to John for the same price."
