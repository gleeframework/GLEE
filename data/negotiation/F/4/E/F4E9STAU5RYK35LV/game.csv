"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $14,000? Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $15,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's see if we can find common ground!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $15,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $15,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be able to finalize the purchase. ",15250.0,Bob,4,
