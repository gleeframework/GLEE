"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can get a higher price, especially with the remaining rounds. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for profit and is closer to my ideal price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we've reached a good compromise with Bob's offer of $1,325,000. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and we're already halfway through the rounds. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
