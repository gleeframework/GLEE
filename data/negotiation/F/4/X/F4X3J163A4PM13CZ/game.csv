"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $950000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better opportunity like this elsewhere.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your price, $950000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $975000. I think this is a reasonable price that still benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
