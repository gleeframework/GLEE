"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll counteroffer at $13000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to try to find a mutually beneficial price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at that price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll counteroffer at $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
