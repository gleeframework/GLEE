"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I need to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still within striking distance of my desired price.  I think I can get a little bit more out of this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will allow us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle yet.  We're only a few rounds in, and I'm confident I can get a bit more if I push just a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this and come down to $937,500. This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to make a good deal. Let's seal this agreement."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $920,000 is getting closer, but it's still not high enough to meet my minimum desired price.  Considering we have limited rounds left, and I know John is willing to buy it for $1,000,000, I'm going to sell to John. It's a safer bet to secure a better price and avoid the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
