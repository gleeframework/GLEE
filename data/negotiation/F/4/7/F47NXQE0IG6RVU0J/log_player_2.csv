Round 2

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is my absolute maximum. If this works for you, I'd be happy to buy it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
