Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives Bob a significant potential gain if he values the product higher than that.  However, it's still below the maximum I'd be willing to accept, as I know I can get $1,500,000 from John.  This strategy balances the potential for maximizing profit with the need to incentivize Bob to buy."
