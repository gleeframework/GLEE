Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're still offering a price that Bob might be willing to pay, as it's less than what the product is worth to him. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price than your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is higher than selling to John, there's still room for improvement. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $95? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price of $100,  Bob's offer of $92 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John for $80, and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
