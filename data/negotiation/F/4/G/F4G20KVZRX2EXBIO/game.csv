"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $175 is a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum price.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While that is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is simply too low for me. To make this work, I can offer a price of $100.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer and still allows you to get a good deal on a valuable product. Let me know if this works for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy it right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
