Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** I acknowledge the possibility of a counteroffer and express my willingness to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I have a couple of reasons to reject it:

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob showed interest, suggesting he values the product. It's worth seeing if I can get a bit more by counteroffering.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away. This can give me more bargaining power in the next round.

I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price than Bob's, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is a little too low for me.  How about $135? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and show appreciation for his interest.
* **Counteroffer:** I propose a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Rationale:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value to Bob and my need for a certain price.

I'm aiming to find a compromise and move closer to a deal, while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, accepting his offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Minimal risk:** There's a risk of continuing negotiation and ending up with John's $120 offer.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting a reasonable price builds goodwill and could lead to future sales from Bob.
* **Time factor:** Continuing negotiation could drag on and delay a sale. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with a decent profit, minimizing risk and maximizing potential for future transactions."
