"Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value you place on it, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
