"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,100,000**, which is still less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**, and accepting this offer saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer again and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this situation, as it achieves Bob's goal of getting the product at a lower price."
