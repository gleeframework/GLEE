"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $16,000 is far too high. It's significantly above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget.  While she's willing to negotiate, I'm going to continue pushing for a lower price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
