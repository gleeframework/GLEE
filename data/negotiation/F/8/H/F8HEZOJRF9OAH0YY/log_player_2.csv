{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,300,000 is within your budget, you want to save as much as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to work with, so you have time to try and get a better price. 
* **John's price is a backup:**  Knowing John's price gives you a limit on how low you're willing to go."

**Reasoning:**

* **Further negotiation is possible:**  You've only had three rounds, and you can still potentially get a lower price.
* **John's price is a strong fallback:** Knowing you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage in these negotiations."

* **John's price is still a strong fallback:**  You can still buy the product from John for $1,500,000, so you don't need to accept Alice's offer if it's not a good deal for you."
