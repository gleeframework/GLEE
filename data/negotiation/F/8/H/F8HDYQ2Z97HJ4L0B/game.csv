"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're close but $10,250 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise at $10,750. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
