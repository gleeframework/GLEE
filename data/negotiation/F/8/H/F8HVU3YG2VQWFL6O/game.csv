"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we try $97.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",97.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $97.50 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $99? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.  Let's close this deal!",99.0,Alice,7,
