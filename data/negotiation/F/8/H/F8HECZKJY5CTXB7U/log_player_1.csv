"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started on a favorable footing, while leaving room for potential compromise if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round to try and get a better price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is closer, I'm still looking for something a bit higher. How about $95? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Still above minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but giving Bob a bit more room to come up. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and would like to counter with $92. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $90.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm running out of time and there's a risk that I'll end up selling to John for $100, which is a lower profit.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
