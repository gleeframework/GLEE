"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in.  I'm starting at $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a little higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also opens the communication with a friendly greeting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position but I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer.  I'm willing to negotiate one more round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $105? That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $102 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as $102 is still below my minimum price. However, we've gone through several rounds and are close to a deal.  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, we might not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds and I'll have to sell to John for $120. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
