"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and selling the product to you for $13500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
