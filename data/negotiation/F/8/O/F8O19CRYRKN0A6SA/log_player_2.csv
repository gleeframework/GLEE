"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can save time and effort by simply buying from John."
