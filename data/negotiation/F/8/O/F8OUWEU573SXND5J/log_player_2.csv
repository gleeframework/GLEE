"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Alice's offer is now matching the price offered by John. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John since we won't save any more money."
