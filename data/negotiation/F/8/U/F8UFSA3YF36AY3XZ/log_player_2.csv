Alice's offer is now equal to John's offer. Bob has reached a point where he has to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice against the certainty of acquiring the product at John's price. Since John's price is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to secure the product now rather than risk a breakdown in negotiations with Alice.  By accepting John's offer, Bob ensures that he gets the product while remaining within his budget."
