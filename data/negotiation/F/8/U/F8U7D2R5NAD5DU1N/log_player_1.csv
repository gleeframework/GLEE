Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but it also shows that I'm confident in the value of my product.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $130 is better than selling to John, but it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140 to Bob. It's a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal, but still leave me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer and allows me to make a profit. While I could try to get a bit more, it's likely that Bob will simply decline my offer and walk away.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and ensures a profit."
