"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a good rapport.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value and benefits to justify the price. 
* **Room for compromise:**  This price leaves room for me to negotiate down if needed, but still ensures I make a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $850,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price reflects the product's true value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a rationale for the counter-offer, focusing on the product's value and benefits.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still holding firm on a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, reminding him of the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $725,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay above $800,000.  Let's compromise at $812,500.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
