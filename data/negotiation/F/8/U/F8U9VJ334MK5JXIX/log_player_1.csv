Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out. Aiming slightly below his maximum value increases the chances he'll accept.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message positions the product as high-value and exclusive. 
* **Price:** $1,150,000  leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, a strong incentive to accept.  You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
