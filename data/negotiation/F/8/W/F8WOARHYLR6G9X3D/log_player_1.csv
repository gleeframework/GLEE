Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Any offer above this is a loss for him.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,000,001 (what's profitable for Bob) and $1,499,999 (what's less than you'd get from John).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept. Since you have a strong fallback option, you're in a good position to be firm.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly below your minimum and allows for a substantial profit margin. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Phrasing like ""pleased to offer"" and ""confident it will be a valuable asset""  projects value and encourages Bob to see the product's worth.
* **No Justification:**  Avoid explaining why the price is set at this level. Let Bob counter if he feels it's too high.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Consider Non-Price Factors:**  Could you offer payment terms, additional services, or other benefits to sweeten the deal without drastically dropping the price?

Let me know if Bob comes back with a counter-offer, and we can strategize your next move!"
