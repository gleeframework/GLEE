Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your persistence.  How about we split the difference again and go with $11,050?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I think it's a price we can both agree on.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He's been negotiating with Alice for several rounds and hasn't been able to get the price down to his ideal price point. At this point, he's only two rounds away from the negotiation ending, and there's no guarantee that he can convince Alice to lower her price further. It's better to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000."
