"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
