"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I could be flexible, but to make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $1,750,000.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I cannot agree to a price of $1,750,000. I am prepared to offer $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
