"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **John's Offer:** $100

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're aiming to save money, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John is the best strategy."
