"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
