"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $9000. Could you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $10500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to see you're coming up on your offer, $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $10000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
