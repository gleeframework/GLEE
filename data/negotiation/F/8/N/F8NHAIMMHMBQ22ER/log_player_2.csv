"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to keep some margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, and Bob has already tried to negotiate a lower price. It's likely that Alice won't go lower than $13,000, making John the better deal."
