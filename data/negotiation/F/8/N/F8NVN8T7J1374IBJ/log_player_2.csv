"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save money:** You're willing to pay $120 max, and Alice's offer is $110, which is still too high.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. You can try a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge. 
* **Don't rush into a decision:**  You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to explore other options before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between your max price ($120) and Alice's offer ($110). 
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, you still have room to lower your price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your max price:** Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget and only slightly higher than your counteroffer.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** It's possible that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back-and-forth without a guarantee of a better price. 
* **Time is valuable:** You've already used two rounds and have only eight left. It's better to secure the product now, even if it's not the absolute best price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating, you risk Alice becoming less interested in selling to you, or you might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
