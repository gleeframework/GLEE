"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer since the product is worth $120 to her, so it's likely that she's making a profit, and I can get it cheaper from John.
