Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 sets a strong floor. Starting negotiations significantly lower might leave money on the table.
* **Targeting Bob's perceived value:** While $800,000 is Bob's value, offering a price slightly above that won't be tempting. A price closer to your minimum ensures you're maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. There's a chance he won't negotiate and you'll lose out on a higher potential profit."
