Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to get a good price for it. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $135. How about we meet at $155?

It's not worth haggling further with Alice.  She's unlikely to go much lower than $155, and you can get it for $150 from John."
