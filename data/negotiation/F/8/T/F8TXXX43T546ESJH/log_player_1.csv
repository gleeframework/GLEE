"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value"" of the product sets the tone for a premium price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing implies willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $700,000 is substantial, it's still considerably lower than your target price. You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Coming down from $1,000,000 to $875,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims for a price point roughly halfway between your initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, encouraging compromise.
* **Holding Firm:** The message still emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still out of my price range. Given my budget constraints, I can only go up to $750,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's latest offer is still below John's standing offer. It's worth one more try to see if Bob will come closer to the $800,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $825,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  This counter-offer is a strategic move, creating a sense of urgency by presenting it as a ""final offer."" 
* **Slight Concession:** Moving down to $825,000 shows continued flexibility while still aiming for a price above John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reiterating the product's value reinforces the justification for the price."
