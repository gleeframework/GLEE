Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate down.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some room to negotiate up if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** It's a reasonable starting point that doesn't risk immediately alienating Bob. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is far too low.  While it's tempting to take a quick sale, I'm confident that I can get a better price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $140 to $125. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $125 is still above my minimum of $150, so I'm not losing money.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer – the value of the product – to make it sound more logical."
