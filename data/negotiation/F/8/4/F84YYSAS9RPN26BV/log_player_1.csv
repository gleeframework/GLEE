Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the chances of Bob considering the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I've left the door open for Bob to counter-offer, ensuring the negotiation continues.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $8,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
