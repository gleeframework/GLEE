Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This gives me a good profit margin while still being a reasonable price for Bob. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $85 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $82 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $82 is only $2 less than selling to John. It's a better deal for me, so I'll accept it."
