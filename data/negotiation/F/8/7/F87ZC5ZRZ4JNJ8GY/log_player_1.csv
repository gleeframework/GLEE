"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for some negotiation, but it also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to accept his offer. It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I've already spent some time negotiating."
