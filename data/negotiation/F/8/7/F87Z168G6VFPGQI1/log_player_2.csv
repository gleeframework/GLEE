Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get this product! While I'd like to close the deal at a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $925,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that you won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's more advantageous to secure the product from John for your maximum budget."
