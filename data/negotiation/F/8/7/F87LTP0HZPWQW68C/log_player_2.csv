"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is significantly lower than its true market value. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a substantial deal for both of us.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a much lower price.  Don't miss out on this opportunity!
