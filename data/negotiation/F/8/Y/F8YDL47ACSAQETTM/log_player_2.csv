"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $125. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $150.
