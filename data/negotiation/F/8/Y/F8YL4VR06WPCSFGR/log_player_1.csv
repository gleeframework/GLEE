"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly opening helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum value ($12,000) as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations. The $10,000 offer sets the stage for a negotiation that will either result in a good deal for me or allow me to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and doesn't represent a good deal for me. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  There's potential to reach a better price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can secure a higher price through counteroffers, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to make the price more acceptable.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests. By gradually lowering my price, I'm demonstrating flexibility while also signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. The $9,500 offer creates a new benchmark for the negotiation and sets the stage for either a successful agreement or a decision to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  However, it's getting closer to my minimum. This indicates Bob is willing to negotiate and may be open to a slightly higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value. Since I can sell to John for $12,000, I'm not under pressure to accept a lower price immediately."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly hints at a desire to close the deal, potentially pushing Bob towards acceptance.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to bridge the gap between our positions and nudge Bob closer to my minimum value.  This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and hopefully lead to a successful agreement. However, I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob remains unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $8,750 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. While Bob is coming closer to my price, it's not yet acceptable.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is still showing interest in the product and willing to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  With limited rounds left, I need to be careful not to lose out on a good deal, but I also don't want to settle for a price that's far below my minimum value. I'll continue to explore counteroffers to see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're pushing for the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $8,750 is still too far below what I need. Let's try $9,000. It's a compromise that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing.
* **Value Reiteration:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my leverage. I'm showing flexibility while also signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. This is a crucial round as it will determine if I can secure a favorable deal or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **Significant Gap:**  The gap between our desired prices is still substantial.  I'm unlikely to get a significantly higher offer in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $12,000 is significantly more attractive than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum value, I'm better off selling the product to John. This ensures I secure a price that meets my needs and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a less favorable outcome."
