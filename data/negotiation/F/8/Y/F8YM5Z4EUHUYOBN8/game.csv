"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This product is really worth it, and I think it's fair to both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
