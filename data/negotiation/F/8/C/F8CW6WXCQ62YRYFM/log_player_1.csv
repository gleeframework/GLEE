Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Name] and I'm asking for $100 for it. It's a great deal, you won't find a better one! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum ($80), but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about $90?  It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $85? Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $80, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's time to finalize the deal."
