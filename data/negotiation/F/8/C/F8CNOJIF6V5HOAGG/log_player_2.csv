"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's not a good deal for Bob. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's closer, but Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. He can counteroffer again, or choose to buy from John if he feels it's not worth the effort to continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $13,000 is pushing my limit. I can offer you $12,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and your valuation. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. Bob has 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. It's a better strategy for Bob to buy the product from John at his maximum budget, ensuring a guaranteed deal and avoiding further negotiation fatigue."
