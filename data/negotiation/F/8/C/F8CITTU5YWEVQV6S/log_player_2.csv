"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. We're looking to maximize our earnings, so we're offering it to you for $110. Please let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, you want to get it for less. Alice's offer of $110 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, and we're willing to negotiate further. We're proposing to sell the product to you for $105. We hope this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is a good compromise.  It's a significant discount from her initial offer and is still a good price for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
