"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $75. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $82 is still a bit too high.  How about $78? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $78. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $81? It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",81.0,Alice,5,
