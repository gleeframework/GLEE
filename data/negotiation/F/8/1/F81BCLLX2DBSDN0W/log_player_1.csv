"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider my offer. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John open. If Bob doesn't engage or offers a price too low, I'll have the option to close the deal with John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired value.  I want to see if I can push Bob further.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**  I'm keeping my options open. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll evaluate his next offer carefully and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $9,500. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired value.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price.  The risk of selling to John for $15,000 is still less than accepting Bob's offer for $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. It's a great price for the product, and I think we both benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're ready to close this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firming Up:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about closing the deal but still not willing to budge further.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" and ""benefit for both"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and might regret missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:**  While it's my final offer, I'm still leaving room for Bob to accept. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids a complete impasse. 

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John. I've shown flexibility but am not willing to compromise any further, especially with only a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I can only afford to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the 6th round, and Bob has only offered $9,500.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk the remaining rounds.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm better off selling to John at $15,000. This guarantees my desired value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
