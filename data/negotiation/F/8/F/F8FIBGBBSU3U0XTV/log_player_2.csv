"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John. Since your goal is to save money and $80 is your maximum price, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
