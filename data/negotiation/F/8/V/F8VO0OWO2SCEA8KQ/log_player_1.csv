Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  What do you think?
