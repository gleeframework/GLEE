The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target price."

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current price. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for her, but still within my budget."
