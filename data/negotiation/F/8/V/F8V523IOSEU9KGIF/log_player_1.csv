Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a high starting point, but it allows for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but still aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject it and counter with a higher price. I want to see if I can close the gap and secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I might reconsider selling to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not convinced he's going to come closer to my value. John is a sure thing at a decent price, so I'm going to go with the certainty."
