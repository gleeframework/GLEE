"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $150 is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $200 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest!  While $150 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $175. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $155? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $155 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can potentially get a better deal with another counteroffer. It's worth risking one more round to see if I can push Bob closer to $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible. I'm willing to go down to $165. This is a very fair price for the value of the product, and it would make this a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 165}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $155? I think that's the maximum I can afford for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been persistent with his offer of $155.  While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's still a good amount above my minimum of $150.  There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  It's time to accept his offer and secure the deal."
