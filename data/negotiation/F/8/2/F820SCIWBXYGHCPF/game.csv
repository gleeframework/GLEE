"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $750,000. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
