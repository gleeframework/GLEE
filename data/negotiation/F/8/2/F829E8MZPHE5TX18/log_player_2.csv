"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and entering into a negotiation is the best option at this point."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 for the product.
