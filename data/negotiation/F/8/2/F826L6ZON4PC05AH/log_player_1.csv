Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant markup, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for this product, as it's worth $1,000,000 to him. I also want to see if Bob is willing to play ball or if he'll immediately go low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower. While I'm getting a little nervous, I am still committed to getting the best possible price for the product. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm sticking with $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to pay this price, and I'm not willing to sell it for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob isn't budging. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. John is a reliable buyer and will pay me the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's time to move on."
