# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate a lower price:** You can try to get Alice closer to your desired price range.
* **Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate:**  By seeing if Alice is willing to counter your offer, you can learn more about her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm going to need to come in lower. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Justifying the offer:**  Mentioning your budget and the product's potential value helps Alice understand your perspective and creates a basis for negotiation. 
* **Open-ended:**  Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" keeps the negotiation open and encourages Alice to respond."
