"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm going to need to come in lower. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
