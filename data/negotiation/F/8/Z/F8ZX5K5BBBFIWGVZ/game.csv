"Hey Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That way we both save a little.",102.5,Bob,4,
