Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. While I value your business and want to reach a fair deal, $900,000 just isn't quite where I need to be.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value and the potential it holds for your business. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer is fair, allows for a mutually beneficial outcome, and represents a significant investment in your success. What do you think?
