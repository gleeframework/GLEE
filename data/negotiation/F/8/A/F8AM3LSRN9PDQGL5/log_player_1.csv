Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's crucial to understand that Bob might not be willing to pay more than his perceived value of $800,000, even with the persuasive language.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide whether to accept, counter again, or proceed with selling to John."
