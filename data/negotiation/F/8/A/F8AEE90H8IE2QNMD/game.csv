"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product. I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $1,150,000.  My final offer is $1,275,000.  This represents a significant reduction from my initial ask and is my best possible price.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
