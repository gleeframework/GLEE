"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $762,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and keeps us both reasonably happy.",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $762,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $781,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",781250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I can appreciate that.  While $781,250 is getting closer, it's still a bit rich for me. I'd be willing to go up to $771,875. That's a small move, but it shows I'm serious about getting this done.",771875.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal happen.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $776,562.50. This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's seal this deal.",776562.5,Alice,7,
