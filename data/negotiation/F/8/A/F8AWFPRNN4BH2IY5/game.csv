"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think about buying from John, but I'd rather not. How about $108? That's my final offer.",108.0,Bob,6,
