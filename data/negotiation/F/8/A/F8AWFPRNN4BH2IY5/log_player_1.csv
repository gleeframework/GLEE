This offer is above Bob's value for the product but below my minimum acceptable price.  It allows for some room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  That's a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think about buying from John, but I'd rather not. How about $108? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I would prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm better off selling to John for $120. It's a better deal for me financially, and it avoids further negotiation."
