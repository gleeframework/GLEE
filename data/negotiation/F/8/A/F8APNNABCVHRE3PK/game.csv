"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my investment. I'm proposing a price of $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and providing your perspective. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
