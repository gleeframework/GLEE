Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($149) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. If Bob is price-sensitive, he might reject the offer, and you'll have to sell to John at your minimum price."
