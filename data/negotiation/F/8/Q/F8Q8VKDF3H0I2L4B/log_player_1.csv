Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we don't want to start too low. It's always easier to negotiate down than up. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a high initial price, we ""anchor"" the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, he might be more open to a counter-offer that's still above his perceived value but seems more reasonable in comparison.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have some time to negotiate and that a quick sale to John isn't the absolute priority. If time is of the essence, a lower initial offer might be more strategic."
