"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not desperate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer. I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down a bit. I'm hoping this will tempt Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not desperate. I want to see if I can get Bob to go a little higher. It's only round 4 and I have a good fallback option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This time I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer as it's closer to his last offer and it is in my best interest.  If he rejects it, I will likely sell to John in the next round."
