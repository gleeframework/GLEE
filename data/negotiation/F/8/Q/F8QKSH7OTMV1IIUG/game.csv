,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is my best and final offer in this round.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. While $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This offer reflects a genuine desire to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's work together to find a price that satisfies both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $890,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $915,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's my final offer in this range.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $915,000 is closer than before, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair, given your needs and mine. We're nearing the end of our negotiation window, and I hope we can find a way to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",900000.0,Bob,8,
