"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a better offer than the initial $12,000, Bob can still do better. He can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. That's a significant concession from my last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target of $8,000. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's desired range.  He can continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is a good step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to get the best price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above Bob's desired range, and with only 3 rounds left, it's likely they won't be able to negotiate much further.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and save the extra $1,800."
