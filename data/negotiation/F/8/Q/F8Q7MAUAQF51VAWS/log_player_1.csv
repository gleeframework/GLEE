"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I will if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,750 is still below my target price, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. That's a significant concession from my last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,000 is a good step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied.
