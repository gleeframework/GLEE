"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
