"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **You have room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** But, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer.** This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value.
* **Highlight the fairness of your offer.** You're emphasizing that this price benefits both of you.
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  There's still space for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You can try to bring the price down even further.
* **Buying from John is a viable option.** However, it's still worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This shows a willingness to meet halfway while still being reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your budget.**  $11,250 is within your $15,000 maximum price point.
* **Alice is showing signs of being firm.**  She's stated this is her final offer, indicating she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Further negotiation may be risky.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, you risk losing the deal entirely, especially if Alice is truly firm.

This is a good compromise. You've managed to negotiate a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, while still securing the product.  Buying from John at $15,000 is now a less attractive option."
