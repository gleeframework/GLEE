Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the price you proposed is considerably below its true worth.  I am willing to come down to $2,000,000 considering your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground within my budget. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit over John's offer of $1,500,000. It's always possible the negotiations could stall, or Bob could lower his offer in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures a good deal."
