I believe it's worth more than its cost and can significantly enhance your experience. Considering its quality and benefits, I am offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the value I see in the product and my desire to make it accessible to someone who appreciates it as much as I do. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

While Alice's message is tempting, $120 is significantly more than your $80 budget and what John offers. You're better off seeing if Alice will lower her price or going with John's guaranteed offer."
