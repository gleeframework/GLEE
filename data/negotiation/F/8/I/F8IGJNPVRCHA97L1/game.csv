"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be totally transparent, I have the option to buy from another seller for $800,000.  If you're able to come down to $675,000, I think we have a deal.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you have other options, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
