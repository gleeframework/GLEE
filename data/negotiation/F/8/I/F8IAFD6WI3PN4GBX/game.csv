"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $160. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going down to $130, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $135? It's getting close to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
