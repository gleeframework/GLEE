"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. By offering $10,500, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get the best possible price. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer and will hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's a lower price than her initial offer, and it's still within my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up buying from John for a higher price. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price."
