"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $8000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, as that's the absolute most I can realistically spend.  Let's work together to make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a good value for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
