,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price point, but it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product that's worth so much more to me.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, though. How about $9,750? This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and where we both started. Let's try to make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I have to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, but I can go a bit higher. How about $9,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  I think we're both very close to an agreement.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
