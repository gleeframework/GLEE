"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $13000. Would you be willing to come down to $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $13500 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13750?  I'm confident this price works for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,3,
