"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth at least $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $13,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $13500 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13750?  I'm confident this price works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $13,750 is a good middle ground and closer to Bob's desired price.
* **No significant gain from further negotiation:** Pushing for a lower price might be possible, but it's unclear if Alice will budge further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a chance Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** It's best for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget and still saves him money compared to buying from John."
