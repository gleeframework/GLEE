Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob provides leverage. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $925,000 allows for a significant profit for Alice (well above her minimum) while still providing substantial value to Bob (saving him $75,000).

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and negotiating style, she could offer a price closer to $1,000,000 or closer to $800,000."
