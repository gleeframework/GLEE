"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,000,000.
* Alice is selling it for $925,000.
* John is selling it for $1,000,000.

Since Alice's price is still higher than your maximum budget, it's better to reject her offer and buy from John. While you'll pay your maximum, you'll still save $75,000 compared to Alice's offer."
