"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $82.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  How about we split the difference and meet at that price?  I think it's fair for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get it for from another seller. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
