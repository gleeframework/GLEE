{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but still within a reasonable range to potentially negotiate. This approach allows for some wiggle room and gives me the opportunity to see if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me in the middle at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $82.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  How about we split the difference and meet at that price?  I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get it for from another seller. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. It's more efficient and less risky to sell to John for the same price."
