"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $108. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle on $106? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $109. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $109. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a great deal for both of us!",109.0,Alice,5,
