Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $13,000 is higher than $10,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $13,000 is lower than your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:**  It's not too aggressive and shows a willingness to compromise.

By offering this price, I'm hoping to start the negotiation process effectively and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept since it's closer to my desired amount, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a higher offer than $11,000 but still lower than $15,000. I will aim for a price that gives Bob some room to negotiate while also being closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my desired price and is within a reasonable range. While I still prefer to get closer to my ideal $15,000, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob might walk away, and I might not get a better offer. Selling to John would yield a higher price, but it's not worth the risk of potentially missing out on a sale with Bob."
