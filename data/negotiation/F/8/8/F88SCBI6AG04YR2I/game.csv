"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its worth to you is $80, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway considering the value you see in our product. Therefore, I am offering the product for $90. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $80.  It's the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident the product is worth it to me at that price. ",80.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $85 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $82. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",82.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I am willing to accept $83 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between your budget and the value I place on the product.",83.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $83, but I'm still trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $81, and I think that's a fair compromise considering we're both trying to get a good deal.  Let me know if that works for you.",81.0,Bob,8,
