"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still not the best deal. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $862,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his desired price.  Bob has already rejected a higher offer from Alice, and John is offering a lower price. It's worth seeing if Bob can get a better deal with Alice before making the purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $862,500. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $855,000, which is a good price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 855000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at $862,500, but I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $860,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go lower than $860,000. While this is a good deal, Bob is running out of rounds and doesn't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at a lower price.  

It's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 now, even if it means missing out on a few more dollars of potential savings."
