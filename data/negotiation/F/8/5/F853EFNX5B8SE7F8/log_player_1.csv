Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation without immediately alienating him.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message establishes a positive rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A counteroffer from Bob is likely. If he's truly interested, he might offer a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Plan B:** I have the safety net of selling to John for my minimum price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's rejection shows he's not willing to pay my initial price, he's still interested. This gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still give me a decent profit, and I'm confident you'd get great value from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value Bob would get from the product, appealing to his interest.
* **Maintain Profitability:** $9,000 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offers are consistently below my minimum. Further negotiations might only lead to a price closer to his initial offer, not mine.
* **John provides guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, securing a higher profit than I would get from Bob.  

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk further negotiations with Bob that might not result in a favorable outcome."
