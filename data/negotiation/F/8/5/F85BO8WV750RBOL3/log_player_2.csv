"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above the maximum I'm willing to pay ($150). There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $120? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it then."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $125, which is a reasonable compromise. At $125, I'm still getting a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more to John."
