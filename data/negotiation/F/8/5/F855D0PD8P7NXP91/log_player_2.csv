"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,400,000. He has a maximum budget of $1,500,000 and knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer, potentially leading to a stalemate or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's reasonable for both parties, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
