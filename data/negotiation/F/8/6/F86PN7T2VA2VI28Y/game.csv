"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget.

I'm confident that this offer is still profitable for you, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you agree.",850000.0,Bob,2,
