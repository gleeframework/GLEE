"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a good start to our negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a win-win, leaving us both with a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This price allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,175,000 just isn't cutting it for me.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
