{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  At $140, Bob is still getting a slight discount, making the offer potentially attractive. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects your offer and makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and avoids any misunderstandings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John for $150 is a more profitable option.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us and still a good deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $130, which is still a good price for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still lower than my minimum selling price of $150. While I'm closer to his price, John is already willing to pay my desired price. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome and avoid further negotiation."
