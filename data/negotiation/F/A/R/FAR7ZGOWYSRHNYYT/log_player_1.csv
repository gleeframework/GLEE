Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I want to earn as much money as I can for the product, I'll start with a relatively high price.

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a significant amount. I'll consider my options.

Since Bob's offer is lower than the product's true value to him ($1,000,000), I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than the product's true value to him.

{""product_price"": 950,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is still lower than I was hoping for, but I'll consider my options again.

Since Bob's offer is getting closer to the product's true value to him ($1,000,000), I think I should be willing to compromise a bit more. However, I don't want to give away too much, so I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than the product's true value to him.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to the product's true value to him ($1,000,000), and I'm starting to think that it's worth considering accepting his offer. However, I'm still not sure if I'm getting the best deal possible.

I'll think about it for a moment... Ah, I've decided! I'll accept Bob's offer.
