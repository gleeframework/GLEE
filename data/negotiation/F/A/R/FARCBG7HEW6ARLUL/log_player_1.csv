Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  While I don't know Bob's exact valuation, I know it's worth $15,000 to him, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above my fallback option (John's offer). 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By emphasizing the product's benefit to Bob, I'm subtly reminding him of its worth, making a stronger case for my proposed price. 
* **Balanced Approach:** This strategy balances ambition (getting a high price) with the security of a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
