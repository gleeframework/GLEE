Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer gives me a good margin of profit (over my minimum of $800,000) while still leaving room for negotiation. Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, and while it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to accept my previous offer. This offer is still a good deal for Bob, but it also gives me a larger profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is a good deal for me. It's also getting close to my initial offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
