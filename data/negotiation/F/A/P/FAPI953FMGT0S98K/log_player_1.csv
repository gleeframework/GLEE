Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You leave room for negotiation and Bob still gets a good deal.
* **It's a clear offer:**  It states the price and includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to get a high price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  You can likely get closer to your target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, how about we meet in the middle at $122.50? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $122.50 is very close to your desired price point and only a small distance away from your initial offer of $125.  Since you're trying to maximize your earnings, accepting his offer is the best choice in this situation."
