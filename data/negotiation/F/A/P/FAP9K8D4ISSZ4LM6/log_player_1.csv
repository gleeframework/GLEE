Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $100.  I'll see how Bob reacts and go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $150, but still above Bob's offer and a good amount more than my minimum value. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is still a good deal. It's significantly more than selling to John for $100 and represents a good compromise.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the sale altogether."
