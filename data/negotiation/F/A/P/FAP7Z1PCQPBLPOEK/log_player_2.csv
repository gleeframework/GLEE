"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a better deal from Alice or can default to buying from John."
