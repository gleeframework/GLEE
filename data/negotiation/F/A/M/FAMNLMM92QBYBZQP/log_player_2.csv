Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get a fair price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is within my budget and closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice could reject my counteroffer again, potentially leading to a higher price or a deal falling through.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
