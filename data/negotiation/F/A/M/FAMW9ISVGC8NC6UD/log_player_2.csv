"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**
* **It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.** You have 10 rounds, and her offer is only slightly above your maximum. There's potential for a good deal. 
* **Buying from John immediately would be suboptimal.**  You can save money if you can get Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in this product and would be happy to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step toward your goal of $12,000.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  You've shown you're interested in the product and are willing to pay a decent price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By offering $13,000, you've created space for further discussion and potentially a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $13,500 is less than your maximum of $15,000.
* **It's a good compromise.** While you'd prefer a lower price, Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. You might end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price. 

**It's a good deal for you, so it's best to accept and secure the product.**"
