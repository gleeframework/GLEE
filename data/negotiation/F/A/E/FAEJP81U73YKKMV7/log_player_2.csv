Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item.

While there is still room for negotiation, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is high."
