"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially reveal his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1500000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price.** I'm aiming for a higher return than what John is offering.
* **There are still rounds left.** I want to see if I can push Bob higher, especially if he's truly interested.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to gauge his budget and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,500,000 but staying above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the unique value of the product to try and justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, aiming to encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We're in the middle of the negotiation process, and there are still several rounds left. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to maximize my earnings. There's a good chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that we can both agree on. I will try to understand his budget constraints and see if there's a compromise we can reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.
* **Reframing the Offer:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Remaining Open:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to keep the negotiation flowing and give Bob the opportunity to counter.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to evaluate his commitment to the deal and consider John's offer in the next round."
