"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but your asking price is a bit high for me. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a fair starting point, we need to bridge the gap somewhat to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it still presents you with a strong return on investment. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my operations.",950000.0,Bob,4,
