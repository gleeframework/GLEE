,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too low. I'm prepared to let the product go for $8,250. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's settle this.",8250.0,Alice,5,
