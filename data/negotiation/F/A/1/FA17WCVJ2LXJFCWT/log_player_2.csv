Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, but $650,000 is a significant discount from the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

We're still significantly below Alice's valuation and have room to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but $725,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll offer you the product for $850,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price is now within Bob's acceptable range.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better outcome than a $50,000 difference."
