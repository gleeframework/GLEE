"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product. ",12000.0,Alice,3,,
