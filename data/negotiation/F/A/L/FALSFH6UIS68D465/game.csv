"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.
