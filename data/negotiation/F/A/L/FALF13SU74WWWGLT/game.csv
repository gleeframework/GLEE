"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. ",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my desired profit. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make it work.",105.0,Alice,5,
