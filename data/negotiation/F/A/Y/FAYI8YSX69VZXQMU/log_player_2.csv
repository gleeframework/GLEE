"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
You're willing to spend $150, but want to save as much as possible. Alice's offer is close, but you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $137.50? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $137.50, which is closer to your target of $130. It's still a little higher, but you've already saved $12.50 from the initial offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or raise the price again. At this point, accepting the offer is likely the best choice to secure the product for a price you're comfortable with."
