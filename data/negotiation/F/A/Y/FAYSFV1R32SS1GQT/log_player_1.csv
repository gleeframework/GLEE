Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also hoping to gauge his interest level based on his initial response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while being closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $13,500 is a decent profit and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer.  It's not worth risking a further decrease in price or a potential breakdown in negotiations."
