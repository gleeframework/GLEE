"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is a fair starting point. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,400,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up today.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
