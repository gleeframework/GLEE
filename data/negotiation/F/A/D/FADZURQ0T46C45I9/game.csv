"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $15,000 for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,500, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $16,500 is close, but I need to get at least $17,000 for it.  This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $17,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",16000.0,Bob,6,
