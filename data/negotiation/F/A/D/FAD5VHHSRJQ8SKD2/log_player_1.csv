I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my ideal price. While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned about wasting time and potentially losing the deal entirely. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
