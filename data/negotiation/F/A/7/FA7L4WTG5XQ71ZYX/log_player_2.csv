"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in paying $140."
