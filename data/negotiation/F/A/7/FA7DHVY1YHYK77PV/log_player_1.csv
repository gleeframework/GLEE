Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a fair and mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could start at $10,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering it at $9,500 leaves Bob with a perceived ""discount"" ($500 less than his perceived value) and a potential profit if he chooses to use the product differently. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point signals that we value the product highly but are open to negotiation within a reasonable range. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong fallback option with John."
