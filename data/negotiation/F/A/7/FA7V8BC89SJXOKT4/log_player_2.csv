"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still above your target of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down in price to secure a sale.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** While you have the option to buy from John, you should try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We want to start by showing Alice that we're serious about negotiating but also set a firm price point. $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair Price:** While it's above Alice's value of $10,000, it's still within your budget of $15,000 and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is polite and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While $13,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Room for compromise:** Alice's willingness to meet you halfway shows that she's open to negotiation. This means there's still room for you to push for a lower price.
* **Continuing negotiation:** You have 7 more rounds, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's still higher than you're comfortable with."

```
