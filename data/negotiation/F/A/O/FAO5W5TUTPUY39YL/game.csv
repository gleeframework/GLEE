"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $12000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's try $12500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're firm on your price. While I'm happy to negotiate, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $13000 one more time. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
