Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gives me a good starting point to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low for me, even though it's better than nothing. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,000. This is still a fair distance from my initial offer, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will find this price more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price and I don't want to risk another counteroffer that could go even lower. Selling to John guarantees me a good price and avoids further negotiation."
