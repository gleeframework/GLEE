{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if needed. I'm also starting with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway with this counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'd prefer to get closer to my $150 target. I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're coming up on the price, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm trying to reach a compromise with Bob. This price is closer to his offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to go down to $105, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
