"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $90.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair compromise.,77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $77.50 is still a little below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to go up to $82.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $79.50? I think this is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",79.5,Bob,6,
