This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives you some room to negotiate down if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $77.50 is still a little below what I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to go up to $82.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 82.5}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $79.50? I think this is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair compromise.
