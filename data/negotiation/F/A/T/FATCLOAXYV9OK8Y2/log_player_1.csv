Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I believe the product is worth more to me than $1,000,000, so this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is still well above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough for me.  I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, and John is offering me a price that is very close to my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John."
