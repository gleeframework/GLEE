{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm going to buy the product from John for $120. We are at the end of the negotiation and it seems like Alice is not willing to go lower than $108.  While I can potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice, the time is running out and I'm not sure if she will accept my next offer. It is not worth the risk of losing the product to John."
