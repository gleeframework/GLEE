"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further. You have a clear advantage knowing Alice values the product at $1,200,000 and you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  A counteroffer will allow you to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Given the value of this product to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to pay John's full price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
