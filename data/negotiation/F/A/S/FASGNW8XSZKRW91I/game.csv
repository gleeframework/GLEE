"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While your product is impressive, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!",1200000.0,Alice,5,,
