"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($110). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message is polite and expresses interest in the product while still making it clear that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming to buy the product for significantly less than John's $80 price, maximizing potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's counteroffer of $90 is closer to my target, it's still above John's price. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Leverage John's Price:**  I have the backup option of buying from John for $80, giving me leverage. Alice doesn't know this, but my willingness to walk away could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant step up from my last offer."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price while still staying below John's $80 offer.  $75 represents a compromise that could be appealing to both parties.
* **Justification:** By mentioning it's a ""significant step up,"" I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise and incentivizing Alice to do the same.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** Although I don't explicitly mention John, my willingness to continue negotiating implies that I have other options if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both made concessions.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice's offer of $85 is above my maximum budget of $80.
* **John's Price is Better:** I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, which is a better deal. 
* **Limited Potential for Further Negotiation:** It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $85, especially since she's emphasized it's a compromise.

It's time to cut my losses and take advantage of John's offer."
