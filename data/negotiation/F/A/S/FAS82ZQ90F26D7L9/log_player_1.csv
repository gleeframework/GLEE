{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $110 is still a good deal for him.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price down if needed, but you have a starting point that's already profitable."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a little too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a significant step up from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

While $75 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've both made concessions.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
