"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum valuation. You should reject and propose a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start the negotiation with a significant counteroffer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, it might indicate a tougher negotiation ahead. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I think you're undervaluing the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $900,000 is still more than your $800,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice meeting you ""halfway"" suggests she's willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance you can get the price closer to your target.
* **John as Leverage:** You can use the option to buy from John as leverage in your negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer you $700,000. That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You've increased your offer by a significant amount ($100,000) to show Alice you're serious about making a deal.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  The $700,000 offer keeps you safely below your $800,000 maximum while leaving a little room for final adjustments.
* **Pressure Point:** This offer puts some pressure on Alice. It's a substantial increase from your previous offer, and it's getting close to your walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Maximum Budget:** Alice's offer of $800,000 matches your maximum budget. 
* **No Benefit to John:** John is also offering the product at $800,000, so there's no advantage to going with him at this point.
* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting now secures the product for you at the best possible price."
