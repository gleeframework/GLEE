"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I think you're undervaluing the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer you $700,000. That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
