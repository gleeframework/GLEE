"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $14,000, I give myself a little wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter-offer.  
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to me, subtly implying its worth. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best possible outcome.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is $12,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates interest in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially increase the price. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000.  I'll keep in mind that I have a backup option with John, giving me leverage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This still reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a chance to own it at a fair price.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Value Focus:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I use a collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to see the offer as a way to find common ground. 
* **Leverage:** My message subtly reminds Bob that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, implying that $13,500 is a more attractive deal for him.

This strategy aims to move the price closer to my desired range while still remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is still to maximize my profit. While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to increase his offer. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price higher than $13,000. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 just doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to go down to $13,250 as a final compromise. This is a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product at a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a smaller compromise, only $250 less than my previous offer, indicating that I'm firm on my price.
* **Finality:** I'm phrasing my offer as a ""final compromise,"" putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Value Focus:** I again emphasize the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price. 
* **Urgency:** The ""final compromise"" wording creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a sense of control in the negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is still to maximize profit. Selling to John for $15,000 remains the best outcome.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While Bob's offers have been getting closer to my desired price, I'm not yet at a point where it's worth accepting.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll use the remaining rounds to see if I can get him to budge further.  I'm keeping in mind that I have a very attractive backup option with John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings.  Think of it this way, you're getting a product worth a lot more to me for a price closer to your budget.  It's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm framing this as my ""final"" concession, implying that there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Value-Driven:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Win-Win Focus:** I'm positioning the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing that it's a fair price for both of us.
* **Urgency:**  The ""final concession"" and ""win-win"" framing create a sense of urgency, pushing Bob towards a decision. 

This strategy aims to secure a higher price while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. It also creates a sense of urgency to potentially nudge him into accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $12,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My priority is maximizing profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are down to our last two rounds.  There is limited opportunity to raise the price further. 
* **Backup Option:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit that is significantly higher than what I can get from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:** Even though Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate, the remaining rounds are not enough to achieve a price that meets my minimum requirement.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure the best possible outcome."
