Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $117. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I can offer it to you for $123. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at $123 the price is a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
