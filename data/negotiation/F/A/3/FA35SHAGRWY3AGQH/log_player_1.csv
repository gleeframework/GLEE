Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Secure a Strong Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is guaranteed a sale at $12,000 to John."
