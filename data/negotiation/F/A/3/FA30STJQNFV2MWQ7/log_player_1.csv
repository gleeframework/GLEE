Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and I believe I have room to negotiate."

It's still a fantastic deal considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
