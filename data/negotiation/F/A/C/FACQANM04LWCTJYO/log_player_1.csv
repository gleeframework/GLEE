Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You still make a profit of $200,000, which is better than the $0 profit you'd get from John.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept. He saves $100,000 compared to his valuation.

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing your own gain, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale."
