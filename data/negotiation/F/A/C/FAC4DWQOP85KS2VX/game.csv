"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
