Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below this price is not strategic. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining the security of the backup offer from John."
