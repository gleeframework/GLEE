"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1450000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value of $1500000. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is $50,000 cheaper than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **It's still within your budget:** The offer is below your maximum value of $1,500,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to save money."
