"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This sets a high bar and allows for potential negotiation down the line. 
* **Value Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit.
* **Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the deal entirely. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Explore Higher Prices:** I can try to get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His willingness to offer a price so close to my minimum suggests he values the product. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Having the option to sell to John gives me more power in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It allows me to gauge his interest and flexibility.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still aware of the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds remaining. It's getting close to the time to finalize the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might not be willing to go higher, and I could end up with the same price from John. Accepting this offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
