"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price. It's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet that value right away. If not, we'll start negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value, and I have a backup buyer in John. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this is a more attractive price for him while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,100,000 right now. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. It's getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above his last one. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal while still getting a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm nearing my limit with John as a backup buyer, I believe I can get a slightly higher price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge significantly. While a deal with Bob at $990,000 is better than nothing, it's very close to my bottom line, and with only 2 rounds remaining, I don't have time to negotiate further.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get my desired value."
