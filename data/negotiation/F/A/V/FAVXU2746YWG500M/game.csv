"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  I believe it's a price that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can come to an understanding.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $750,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,5,
