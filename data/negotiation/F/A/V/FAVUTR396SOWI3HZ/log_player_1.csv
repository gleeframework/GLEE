"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, which is still a significant profit for me. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm doing this to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I won't go any lower.  If he still rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
