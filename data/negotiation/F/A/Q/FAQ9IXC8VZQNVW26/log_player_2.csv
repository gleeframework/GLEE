# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can work together to find a price that suits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high.  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is significantly more than your desired price of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer of $915,000 is still above my target price of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will counter with a higher price or we might not reach an agreement in the remaining round.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000, guaranteeing a successful purchase within my budget."
