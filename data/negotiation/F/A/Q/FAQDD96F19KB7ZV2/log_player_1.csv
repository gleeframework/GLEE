Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to entice Bob and justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Remember, your ultimate goal is to maximize your profit, and getting any amount above $1,500,000 is a win!"
