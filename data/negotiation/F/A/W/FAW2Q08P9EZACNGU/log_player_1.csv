Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a profit well above my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'll be prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum goal of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,800,000 to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still puts me well above my minimum goal and potentially closer to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still too low, and I'm worried that we'll just keep going back and forth without reaching a deal. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm guaranteed a profit with John's offer of $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
