Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $1275000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1285000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000.
