"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1275000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let's close this deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $1275000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1285000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
