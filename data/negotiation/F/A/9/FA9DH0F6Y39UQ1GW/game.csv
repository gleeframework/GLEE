"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $20,000 for the product.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $18,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that shows I'm serious about buying this product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you the product for $14,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my absolute limit. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're nearing a final price.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to look at other options, including buying from John.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been patient and willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",14000.0,Alice,9,
