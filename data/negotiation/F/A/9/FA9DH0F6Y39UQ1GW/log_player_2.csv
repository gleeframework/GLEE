{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice is firm on her price of $14,000.  This is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John at $8,000 to stay within my budget.  While it would be nice to get a better price, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice and having to start over with another seller is too high at this point."
