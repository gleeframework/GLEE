Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100):**  This ensures you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($120):** This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more, especially since the product is worth $120 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $105?  This way, we both get a good price."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so I'll offer $102.50. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $102.50 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $100, and it's still a decent price for Alice, given the product's value to Bob.  It's likely that further negotiations will only result in small price adjustments, and the risk of Bob walking away is increasing.  Accepting the offer ensures a good profit for Alice."
