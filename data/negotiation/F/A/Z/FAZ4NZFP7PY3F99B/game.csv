"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $105?  This way, we both get a good price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so I'll offer $102.50. Can we meet at this price?",102.5,Bob,4,
