"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to attempt to secure a higher price from Bob or potentially sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my need to achieve a reasonable return. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob could reject further counteroffers or that I could end up selling to John for the same price.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and meets my financial goal."
