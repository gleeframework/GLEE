"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,400,000, I'm aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident but Open:** The message emphasizes the product's value while inviting Bob's input, fostering a collaborative negotiation environment.
* **Preserving the Backup:** It's too early to consider John's offer.  Securing a deal closer to Bob's valuation is the priority in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our starting point and still leaves a considerable gap to our minimum acceptable price. We have ample room to negotiate and time is on our side for now.  Selling to John would be a significant loss compared to the potential profit from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling flexibility but maintaining a strong position. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify the higher price and prevents anchoring at Bob's lower offer. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  We're still comfortably above John's offer, ensuring we have options if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow but Steady:** Bob is inching up, which indicates he's still very interested. We are still far above our minimum.
* **Limited Time:** While we have time, waiting too long could push Bob away. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer Needed:**  We need to signal some flexibility to encourage Bob without dropping too low, too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to finding the right deal is clear. Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to consider $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value you're gaining while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** A $50,000 drop signals a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Framing the Offer:**  Highlighting both the product's value and Bob's perspective fosters a collaborative tone, increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **Deadline Approaching:** While we're not desperate yet, moving closer to a deal is wise as time goes on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but no more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has signaled this is his limit.  Continuing could push him away entirely.
* **Strong Profit:**  $1,275,000 is a significant gain, well above our minimum and John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for more has diminishing returns and risks losing the deal altogether at this point."
