"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this price reflects that. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is close to your maximum budget, rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower the price. You have a better chance of getting a lower price from Alice than from John, who has a fixed offer."
