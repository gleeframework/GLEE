Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

1. **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you're still likely to land above your minimum.
2. **Maximizing profit:**  You're aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer.
3. **Staying below Bob's valuation:** This increases the chance Bob will accept, as he's getting a perceived deal."
