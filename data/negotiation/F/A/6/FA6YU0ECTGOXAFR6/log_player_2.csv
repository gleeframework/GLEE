"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, but I understand its worth might vary depending on your needs. I am offering it to you for $150. I believe this price reflects its quality and potential value to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further or making a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are only willing to spend up to $150, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
