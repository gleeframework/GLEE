"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to get a little more for my investment and gives you a great deal on something you'll surely appreciate.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
