"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a fantastic price for you, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $8,800 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,200. This price reflects the value you'll get from it, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward!",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,100.
