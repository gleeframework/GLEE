Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to provide.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a challenging offer for me, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering your maximum budget, I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my budget. At this point, the negotiation seems to be stalling. I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially end up with a worse deal. Since John is offering the product for my maximum budget, it's the safest and most financially sensible option."
