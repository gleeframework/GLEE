Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it sounds promising,  $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I'm looking to gain from this product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
