Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can still get a better deal from John."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's budget, and he can get the product for a price he's comfortable with from John.  It's better to secure the product at a price he can afford rather than continue to negotiate with Alice."
