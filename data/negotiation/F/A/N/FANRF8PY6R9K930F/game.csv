"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still only able to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
