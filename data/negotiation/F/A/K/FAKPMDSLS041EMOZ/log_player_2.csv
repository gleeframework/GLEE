"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also within your budget, so you have some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $95, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  There's a good chance you can get it for less, so it's worth continuing to negotiate. You can try a counteroffer closer to $85 to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $90.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's offer of $95. It demonstrates your willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Alice will accept.  You're still below your desired price, but you're getting closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than $92. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not going to go any lower. If you're interested, let me know, but I'm not going to budge. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $92 is getting closer to your budget, you're now five rounds in and it's clear she's not willing to come down to your ideal price.  Rather than continue to negotiate, it's more efficient to take the guaranteed deal from John at $80.  You'll save yourself time and ensure you get the product within your budget."
