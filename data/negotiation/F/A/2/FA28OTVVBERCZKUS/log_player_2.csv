"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have an amazing opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare gem and I'm looking to sell it to someone who truly appreciates its value. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a steal at this price, considering its worth to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $15,000, which is more than twice the maximum I am willing to pay. I will look for a better deal elsewhere.
