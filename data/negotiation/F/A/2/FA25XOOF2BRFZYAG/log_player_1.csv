Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. It's better to sell to John for $120 and avoid further haggling."
