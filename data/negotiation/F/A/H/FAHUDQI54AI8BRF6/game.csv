"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am unable to agree to $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm happy to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
