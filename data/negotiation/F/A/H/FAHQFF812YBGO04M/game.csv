"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I can do $11,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  Let's make this our last exchange to save us both time. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
