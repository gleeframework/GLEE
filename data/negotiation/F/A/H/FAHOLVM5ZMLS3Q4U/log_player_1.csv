Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $100 is more than $80, giving Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to buy.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both of you to compromise and hopefully find a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $85 is a good price, it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to pay $95?  I believe this is still a fair price, considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to John for $120, Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
