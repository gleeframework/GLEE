,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $85 is a good price, it's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to pay $95?  I believe this is still a fair price, considering the value this product brings.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
