Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above my minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended. I'm highlighting the value of the product and leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a higher price allows for negotiation and potentially getting closer to the $120 value for Bob. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than selling to John, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $80.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $85, which is my minimum desired price. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to earn a decent amount.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $85. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to further encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, I see your point. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum desired price.  It's the same as what John is willing to pay, so accepting Bob's offer makes sense.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
