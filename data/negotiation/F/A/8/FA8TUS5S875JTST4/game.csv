"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? This would allow me to make a fair deal while also respecting your needs.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm prepared to lower my price to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,
