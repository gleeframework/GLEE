"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $1100000 at this point.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
