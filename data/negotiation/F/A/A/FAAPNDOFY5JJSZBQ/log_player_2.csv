"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price.  He should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to his maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can get the same product from John for a lower price. He should counteroffer Alice again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
