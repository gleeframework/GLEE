Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value of $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
