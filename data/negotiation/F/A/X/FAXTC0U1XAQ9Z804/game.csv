"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $800,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own value of $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my own value of $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
