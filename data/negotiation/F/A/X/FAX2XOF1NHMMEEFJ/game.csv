"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the significant value this product brings. Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to acquire this product. While I'm willing to compromise, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $962,500? This price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. Let's come to an agreement.",962500.0,Alice,5,
