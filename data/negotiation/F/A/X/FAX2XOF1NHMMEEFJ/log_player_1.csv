"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I know the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the significant value this product brings. Let's bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get closer to $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to acquire this product. While I'm willing to compromise, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $962,500? This price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. Let's come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 962500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with and we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $940,000 to close this out. That's my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $940,000 is getting close to my ideal price. Given that it's his final offer, and we only have a few rounds left, it's time to accept and secure the deal. I can always try to get a better price later, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
