"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This counteroffer is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and while it's higher than Bob's last offer, it's likely that further negotiation won't get him a much better price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further rounds of negotiation that could lead to a worse outcome."
