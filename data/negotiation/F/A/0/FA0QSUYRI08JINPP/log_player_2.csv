"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it at that same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Alice is offering it at the same price, meaning you wouldn't save any money. You can get the product from John for the same price. Since the goal is to save money, you should reject Alice's offer."
