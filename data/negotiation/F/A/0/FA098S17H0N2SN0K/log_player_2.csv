"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it could greatly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. For this unique opportunity, I am offering the product for $12000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to offer a compromise. I propose we set the product price at $11500. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than the previous round, it's still higher than Bob's desired price of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  There are still many rounds left, and Bob doesn't want to commit to a price too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  I believe this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
