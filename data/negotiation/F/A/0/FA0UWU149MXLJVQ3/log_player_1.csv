Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a starting point that is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still gives him a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging message highlights the value proposition for Bob and emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Increase my chances of a quick sale:**  Bob might be willing to accept immediately due to the perceived discount.
* **Maximize my earnings:** While I'm willing to sell below my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth. 
* **Prepare for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response and the risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below the $15,000 I could get from John.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the possibility of securing a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to reach a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. If he refuses again, I'll have to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges both your budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's offer and emphasize my willingness to compromise. I also highlight the fairness of the new price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** It signals that I'm flexible and open to reaching a deal.
* **Keeps the negotiation alive:** It avoids an immediate rejection and encourages further discussion.
* **Offers a better price for me:** It's closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer.

By continuing the negotiation, I'm aiming for a final price that's closer to my target but also acceptable to Bob. If he rejects, I'll reassess my position and decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to meet in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** While he's shown willingness to compromise, $9,500 is still significantly less than the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.**  There's a risk that continued negotiation with Bob could drag on, leading to wasted time and potential for him to walk away entirely.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum value, ensuring a secure outcome.  The potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are not worth the risks of uncertainty and the potential for a worse outcome."
