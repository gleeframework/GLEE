"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a unique piece that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. While I'm confident in its worth, I'm also aware of another buyer, John, who is willing to pay the same amount. Ultimately, I'm looking for the best possible outcome, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
