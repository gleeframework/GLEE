Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While Bob values the product at $80, you know John will pay $100. Starting at your desired price point maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you're aiming for $100, the initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially secure a price slightly above $80. 
* **Avoid Losing a Sale:** Offering it at a price too far above $80 might discourage Bob immediately, leading him to reject the offer without a counter-proposal.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your earnings and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
