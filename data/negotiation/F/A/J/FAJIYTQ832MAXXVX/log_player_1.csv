Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I won't sell for that low of a price.  I'll try to get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $115. That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more than my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I could do $110. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's better to close the deal now than risk going lower or losing time."
