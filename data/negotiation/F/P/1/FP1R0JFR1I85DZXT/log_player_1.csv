Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This should encourage Bob to negotiate while giving me room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum price, $130 is still a good deal considering Bob's value of the product.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
