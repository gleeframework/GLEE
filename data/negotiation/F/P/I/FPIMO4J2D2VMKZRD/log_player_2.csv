{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's initial offer is at your maximum, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal. There's no downside to rejecting and seeing what counteroffer Alice might make."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy. It shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. A $300,000 discount is a good starting point, as it's a substantial amount but still leaves room for further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
