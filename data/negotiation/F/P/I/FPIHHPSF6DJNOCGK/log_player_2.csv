"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While $1,000,000 is within your budget, it's still too close to your maximum price point. There's room for negotiation. 
* **You want to explore a lower price.** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John is a fallback option.**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,200,000 gives you leverage in your negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move. 
* **Focus on value:**  The message highlights the ""value"" for both parties, emphasizing a fair price that acknowledges Alice's needs while staying within Bob's budget.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum, leaving room for potential back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. How about we settle on $950,000? This price allows for both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a decrease from her initial offer, $950,000 is still a significant distance from your desired price point. 
* **Further negotiation is possible.** Alice is showing willingness to compromise, indicating further negotiation could lead to a more favorable price for Bob.
* **John remains a safety net.** Knowing John's offer provides leverage and security in the event negotiations with Alice break down."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $900,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal where we both walk away feeling good about the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continues the negotiation:** This counteroffer builds on Alice's willingness to negotiate, suggesting a compromise that could move the deal closer.
* **Offers a concrete number:**  $900,000 is a midpoint between Alice's current offer and Bob's previous offer.  
* **Highlights the benefits:**  The message emphasizes a ""mutually beneficial"" deal, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness while remaining within Bob's budget."
