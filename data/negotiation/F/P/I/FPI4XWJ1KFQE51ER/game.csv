"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a significant reduction from the original price, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.  Let's close this deal, Bob.  I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's the best we can do at this point.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I understand your position, but $975,000 just isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,8,
