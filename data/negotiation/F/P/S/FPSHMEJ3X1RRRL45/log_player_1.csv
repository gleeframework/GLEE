"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value you've placed on the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm tempted to take $950,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 980000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no further. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I've reached my limit with Bob, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John."
