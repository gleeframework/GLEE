"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, even more than my asking price.  To get the ball rolling, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Let's aim for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John is always an option, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility while emphasizing the product's value.  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to move closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'd like to propose a price closer to what I'm comfortable with. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still significantly apart. It's worth pushing him a bit further in the next round, but I'll need to be mindful of the shrinking window for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,220,000, but that's my absolute limit. This offer stands for the next 24 hours only, as I have a time-sensitive commitment from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1220000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm dropping my price slightly again, but I'm also introducing a sense of urgency and a firm limit to encourage Bob to make a serious move. This tactic aims to either secure a deal close to my target or prompt me to walk away and take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given this some more thought, and I would like to propose a price of $1,180,000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's latest offer is still significantly below my absolute minimum. Continuing the negotiation at this point is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
