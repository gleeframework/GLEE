"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not ready to pay $1000000 at this point.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750000.  This is a fair price considering my own assessment of the value.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident in the value of this product and believe a price closer to $900000 would be more fair.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I believe a price of $850000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to gain from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,
