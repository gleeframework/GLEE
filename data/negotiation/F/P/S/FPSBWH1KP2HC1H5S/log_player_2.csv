"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is fair in terms of the product's value, there's no incentive for Bob to accept it right away.  He has the option to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not ready to pay $1,000,000 at this point.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price considering my own assessment of the value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still shows that Bob is interested in purchasing the product. By offering a price that is significantly lower than his maximum value, Bob is trying to encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident in the value of this product and believe a price closer to $900000 would be more fair.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price.  He can also use the threat of buying from John to encourage Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I believe a price of $850,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to gain from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. By offering $850,000, Bob is showing flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal for himself.  This counteroffer is likely to be acceptable to Alice, especially given the threat of Bob buying from John."
