Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price point.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject a higher offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still ensuring you meet your minimum selling price."
