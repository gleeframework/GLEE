"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $140 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $155? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 155}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $145 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to go down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest price. This is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
