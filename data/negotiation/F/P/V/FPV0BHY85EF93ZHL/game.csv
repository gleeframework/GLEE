,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your budget constraints, $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $155? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $145? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to go down to $150, but that's my absolute lowest price. This is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,5,
