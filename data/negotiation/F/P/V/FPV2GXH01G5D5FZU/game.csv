"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your honesty about your budget. While $800,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,950,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my part, considering the true value of this product.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,950,000 is still quite a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad to see you're serious about finding a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, we're still quite a bit apart.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects my sincere desire to strike a deal while still recognizing the significant value this product holds.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm ready to commit to a price of $1,300,000.  This represents a significant step up from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect your commitment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Let's make this happen â€“ I propose a final price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
