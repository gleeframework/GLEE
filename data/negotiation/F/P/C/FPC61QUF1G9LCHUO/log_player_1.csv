"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my minimum value.  I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I think this is a reasonable compromise, and Bob might be more likely to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum.  However, since John is also willing to pay that price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll sell to John to guarantee the deal and avoid the risk of further rounds."
