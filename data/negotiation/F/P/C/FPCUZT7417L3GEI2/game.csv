"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9500.
