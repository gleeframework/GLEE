"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $10,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still above his initial offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offers are getting too low for me, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, John's offer is a safe and secure option that guarantees my minimum profit."
