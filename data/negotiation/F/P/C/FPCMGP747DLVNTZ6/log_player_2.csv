"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, considering its features and benefits.  I'm initially suggesting $11,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower than $11,000 since the product is worth $8,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. I've tried to price this fairly, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and is closer to Bob's desired price range.  While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob losing the deal altogether."
