Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the details you've shared about the product. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum price than it is to his maximum perceived value.  There's room for negotiation.
