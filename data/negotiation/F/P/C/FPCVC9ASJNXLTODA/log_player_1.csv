Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strategic move to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. It also sets the stage for potential negotiations if he counteroffers.  I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John at $800,000, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. It's a strong position, as I can always fall back to John's offer of $800,000 if Bob doesn't budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $920,000 is a good price considering my minimum is $800,000.  It's a good compromise, and further negotiation might just result in more back-and-forth without a guaranteed higher offer."
