This offer is a bit lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's a starting point that allows me to potentially earn more than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, while also leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm interested in selling the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but $9000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $11000. How about $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe the product is worth more.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 10625}
