"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below the middle ground to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for a potential counteroffer from him and gives me the opportunity to adjust my price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share this product. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still far from the value Bob places on the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still securing a price that's closer to the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $100 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price. There are several rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $100 is closer, it's still a little below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

I'm trying to push for a higher price while still showing flexibility. This counteroffer is a compromise that might be appealing to Bob."
