"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $92.50 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $94? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",94.0,Alice,5,
