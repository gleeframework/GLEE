"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a decent price while staying within my budget. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,150,000 is closer, I still need to stay within a tighter budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, I need to stay above $1,140,000 to make this work for me.  This is a small increase from your last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1140000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you need a certain price to make this work.  I'm willing to go up to $1,130,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1130000.0,Bob,8,
