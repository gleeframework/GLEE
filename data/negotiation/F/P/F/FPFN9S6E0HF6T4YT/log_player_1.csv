Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair reflection of its worth and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and encouraging him to think beyond the base price.
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone remains open for discussion, making Bob feel comfortable to counter-offer or discuss the price further.

While I have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
