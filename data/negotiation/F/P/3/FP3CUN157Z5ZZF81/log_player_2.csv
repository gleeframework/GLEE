"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your life and business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes no sense to accept a price that's $6,000 more than you're willing to pay."
