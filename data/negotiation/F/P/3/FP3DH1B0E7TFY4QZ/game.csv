"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on $11,000. It's a fair price and allows both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
