"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on $11,000. It's a fair price and allows both of us to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $12,000 in the remaining rounds.  Taking John's offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
