"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your operations.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential, but is also fair for both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a win-win scenario, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while securing a strong return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
