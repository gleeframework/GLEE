{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. Let's meet in the middle at $135.  I'm very interested in your product and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $150, $135 is still a good price and it's likely that Bob won't go higher. It's better to close the deal now than to risk further negotiation and possibly end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $100."
