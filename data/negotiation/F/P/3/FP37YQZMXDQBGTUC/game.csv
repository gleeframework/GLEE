"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
