"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has value, the price point of $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product and what it can offer you, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind.  To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $650,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we have quite a gap between our valuations. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to drop my price significantly to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential return on investment this product offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
