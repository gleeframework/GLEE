"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good price. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I know my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, but I still believe I can get closer to my initial price. I want to see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,250,000 is a good deal, especially given that John's offer is only $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
