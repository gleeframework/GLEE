"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $1200000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to come down a little to meet in the middle. How about $1300000? This is a fair price for the value this product will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1300000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get it for $1250000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this figure.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
