Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $800,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This doesn't mean he'll pay that much, but it sets an upper limit. 
* **The Goal:**  Maximize your profit by getting Bob to pay as close to his perceived value as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confidence:** The language is positive and emphasizes the product's value.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with $875,000 sets a high initial point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is your safety net) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's important, you might be more flexible.  

Let me know how Bob responds!"
