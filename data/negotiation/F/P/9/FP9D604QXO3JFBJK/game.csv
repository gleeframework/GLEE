"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $130. How about we meet at $110? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which would be $117.50. Can we agree on that?",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $117.50, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $128. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the last price I'm willing to pay. Can we agree on that?",120.0,Bob,8,
