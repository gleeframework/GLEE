Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him, so it's a good deal for both of us.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
