Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** It gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is brief and to the point, making it easy for Bob to understand the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum price and a good compromise. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
