"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer, but I'm still leaving $100,000 on the table compared to John's offer.  I'm willing to push Bob a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**  I'm matching John's offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a fair final price or risk losing the deal."
