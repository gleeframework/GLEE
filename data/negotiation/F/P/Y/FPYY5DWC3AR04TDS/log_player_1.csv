"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a good price from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counter-offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to be more competitive, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum value, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'd rather secure a sale at this point than risk losing the deal altogether."
