Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but it gives me room to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving some room for a compromise.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than that from Bob, as long as he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, $700,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give away the product for cheap.  I believe this price is fair and might convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. Bob needs to meet me halfway. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than selling to John. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might accept."
