"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price, there's a good chance you can negotiate even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for both of us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, but it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price, it's getting closer to my target. At this point, I've already rejected two of her counteroffers, and further negotiation might risk losing the opportunity to buy from her.  It's more advantageous to accept this offer than to risk going to John, who will cost significantly more."
