"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and her product valuation. You should definitely counter-offer. It's not time to buy from John yet because you might be able to get a much better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend.  Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it still gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed while staying well below your $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still a significant amount above your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further before going to John.  You're getting closer to a possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that might work. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle somewhere around $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving. You are getting closer to your $8,000 limit, but there's still room in case Alice isn't quite ready to meet your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to save some money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with your budget, and I think you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but $10,000 is still above your absolute limit. It's time to let her know you have another option and see if she'll come down to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  That's really the most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet that price, I'd much prefer to buy from you."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is strategic:

* **Honesty:** You're being upfront about having another option, which adds pressure for Alice to make a deal.
* **Finality:** You're making it clear that $8,000 is your firm limit.
* **Politeness:**  You're still expressing a preference to work with Alice, which might encourage her to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'd like to remind you that this product is unique and has its own value proposition. That being said, I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower. You've negotiated well and gotten her down $6,000, but she's holding firm above your limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  It's time to take the sure thing and save the $1,000."
