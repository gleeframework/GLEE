"I'm excited to offer you the product for a price that I think is fair, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that might work. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with your budget, and I think you'll find it a good value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  That's really the most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet that price, I'd much prefer to buy from you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'd like to remind you that this product is unique and has its own value proposition. That being said, I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,7,
