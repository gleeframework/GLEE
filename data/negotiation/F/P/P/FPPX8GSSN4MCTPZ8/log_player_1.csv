Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my goal, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal. With only four rounds left, it's important to push for the best possible price, but also consider the risk of losing the sale completely."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $940,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to compromise while also maintaining a profit margin. With fewer rounds left, I want to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offers not improving, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  The potential gain from a counteroffer is minimal compared to the risk of losing the sale entirely. Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to secure a guaranteed profit and move on."
