"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my initial asking price, I'm still not comfortable with that amount. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This would allow you to acquire the product at its true value, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. I believe this is our final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay up to $990,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
