"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my initial asking price, I'm still not comfortable with that amount. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This would allow you to acquire the product at its true value, and it would be a fair deal for both of us.
