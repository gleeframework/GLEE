Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. Let me know what you think, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique value,"" you subtly imply the price is justified without revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""we can discuss further"" signal to Bob that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring you'll get at least $15,000 for the product.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
