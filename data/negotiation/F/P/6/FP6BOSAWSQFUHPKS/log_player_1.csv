Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than his last offer of $100. Since I have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John, it makes more financial sense to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation rounds with Bob."
