Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your price, but you can't raise it once offered."
