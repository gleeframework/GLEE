It's too expensive to buy from Alice. You should try to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $10,000. This is a significant discount from her initial price, but still within my budget. I'm hoping she'll see the value in quickly closing the deal."

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500. It's a compromise from my previous offer and hopefully demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm still well within my budget, and this price might be more appealing to Alice."

Alice is not willing to budge much.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  I'm still getting a good deal, and I don't want to risk wasting more time in negotiations with Alice."
