"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm now offering the product to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll be happy with it.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.",92.5,Bob,6,
