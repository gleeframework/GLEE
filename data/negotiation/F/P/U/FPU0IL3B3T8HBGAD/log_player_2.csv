"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics just yet, but I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at the same price as John. While she claims it's worth $1,200,000 to her, we have no way of verifying this. There's no incentive to buy from Alice as we can get the same product for the same price from John."
