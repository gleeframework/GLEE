,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $8,000 is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to come down to that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
