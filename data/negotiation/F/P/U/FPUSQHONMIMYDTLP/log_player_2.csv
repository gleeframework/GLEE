Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $8,000 is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to come down to that, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
