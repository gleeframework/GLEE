Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to her lowest price, which is a fair deal for both parties. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially having to buy from John at a higher cost."
