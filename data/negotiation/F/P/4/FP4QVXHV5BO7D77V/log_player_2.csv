You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is deceptive. While she claims the product is worth more than $100 to me and throws in a ""complimentary"" service package, the bottom line is she's asking for $125.  I'm better off rejecting this offer. I know I can get the product for $100 from John, which is my maximum budget."
