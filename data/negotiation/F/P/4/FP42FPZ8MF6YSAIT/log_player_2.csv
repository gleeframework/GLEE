"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am extending an exclusive offer for $1,200,000. This price is inclusive of all additional services and support we provide to ensure a smooth transition and optimal use of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm currently operating on a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to stay within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your situation while still ensuring a fair deal for both parties, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers, providing you with a substantial discount while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous for him to buy from John. There's no guarantee that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the remaining rounds."
