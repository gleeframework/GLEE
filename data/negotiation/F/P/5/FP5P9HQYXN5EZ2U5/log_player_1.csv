{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate but doesn't make the offer unreasonable.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It allows for room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's value but also willing to compromise. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I can always sell to John for $10,000, I want to see if I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
