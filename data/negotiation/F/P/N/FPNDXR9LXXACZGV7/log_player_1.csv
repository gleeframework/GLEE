Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, your initial price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a significant investment. This is my maximum offer, reflecting the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could take it and guarantee the sale, there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the hopes of getting a better price, knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting,  I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To move towards an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. However, the drop is still within a range where I'm making a substantial profit.
* **Anchoring:**  My initial high offer helps anchor the negotiation. By coming down, I'm aiming to bring Bob closer to my desired price range, but not giving up too much ground too quickly.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm mindful that I have John as a backup option, ensuring I won't be forced into a deal that's unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. To move closer to a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant commitment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's truly interested. While $1,400,000 is a good profit, I'm aiming for at least $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to test his flexibility further. I'm still comfortable with the risk because John provides a guaranteed minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling seriousness while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price above his last offer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer effectively splits the difference between our previous positions, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also setting a firm limit.
* **Time Constraint:**  As we're over halfway through the rounds, I'm increasing the pressure slightly to encourage a decision without being overly aggressive."
