"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,335,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.",1335000.0,Alice,5,
