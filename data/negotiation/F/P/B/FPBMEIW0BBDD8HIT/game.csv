"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $11250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a good compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
