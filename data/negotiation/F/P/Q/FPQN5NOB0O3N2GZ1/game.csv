"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $75 right now.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  What do you say?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I think $125 is a good compromise. However, I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $150. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $137.50.  Let's see if we can make this work.",137.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. It's a small step back from $150, but I think it's still a good compromise.",142.5,Alice,7,
