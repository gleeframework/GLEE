"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
