{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation. It also invites Bob to engage in the conversation, making him feel like he has some control in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was willing to pay for the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is not a fair price for the value I place on the product. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down some. How about $120? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that amount. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go to $110. This price reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $110, so I'll offer $105. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm not confident that we'll reach a deal with Bob that satisfies me. He's not showing a willingness to move much higher.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'll sell to John for $150 and ensure I get the value I want for the product."
