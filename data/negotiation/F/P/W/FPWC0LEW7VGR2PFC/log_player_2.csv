"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $1200000. Considering its worth to you is $1500000, I believe this is an excellent opportunity for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal. You have a clear advantage knowing the product is worth less to Alice than to you. There's potential to negotiate a price closer to her valuation of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure a price closer to the product's actual value to me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which still leaves a healthy profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
