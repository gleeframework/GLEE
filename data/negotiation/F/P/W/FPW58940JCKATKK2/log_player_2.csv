"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a good deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $6,000, we're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired range. Even if Alice rejects it outright, it sets a lower reference point for future offers.
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to be polite and express continued interest in the product while being firm about the price discrepancy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down, but $12,000 is still her maximum value for the product, and above our $8,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, giving us space to negotiate further and potentially get closer to our target price.
* **John is an Option:**  While we haven't reached a deal with Alice yet, it's good to keep in mind that we have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now. Would you consider $7,500? That would be a price I'm more comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We increased our offer to $7,500, demonstrating our willingness to meet closer to the middle ground.
* **Below Our Limit:** This offer is still safely below our $8,000 maximum, leaving some room for potential upward movement if needed.
* **Expressing Budget Constraints:** By mentioning that $12,000 is a ""stretch,"" we are subtly reminding Alice of our budget limitations, hopefully encouraging her to make further concessions."
