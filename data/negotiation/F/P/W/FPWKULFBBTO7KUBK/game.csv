,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and it reflects the value of this product for your business.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to drop to $1,025,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value to your business. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm ready to make a serious offer: $990,000.  This is a strong offer and reflects the upper limit of what I'm willing to spend. Let me know if this works for you.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $990,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,005,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for your business. Let's finalize this deal.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
