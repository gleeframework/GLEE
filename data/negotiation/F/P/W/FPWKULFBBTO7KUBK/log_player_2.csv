"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and it reflects the value of this product for your business.  Let's make this deal happen.

While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to drop to $1,025,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value to your business. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is coming down in smaller increments, signaling she might be willing to go lower than John's price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very patient and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm ready to make a serious offer: $990,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $990,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,005,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for your business. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go below John's price at this point. She's consistently countered in a way that suggests $1,000,000 is her absolute floor.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to secure the product at the best price."
