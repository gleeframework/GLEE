"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still not quite enough for me. Let's split the difference at $14,250. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",14250.0,Alice,5,
