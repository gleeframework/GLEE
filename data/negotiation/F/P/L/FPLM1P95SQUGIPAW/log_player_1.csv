"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point.  I'm also framing it positively, emphasizing the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a price that's exactly my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent price. I'm also emphasizing the value for Bob to keep him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still not quite enough for me. Let's split the difference at $14,250. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, showing flexibility.  I'm also highlighting the deal for Bob, keeping the negotiation focused on value. This might be enough to sway him, but if not, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's more important to me to get a good price than to potentially lose more money trying to negotiate with Bob."
