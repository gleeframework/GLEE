``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high as to immediately scare him off. It also opens the door for a conversation by inviting Bob to express his thoughts.  This leaves room for a potential counteroffer and further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate you considering my product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  Although I'm willing to negotiate, I'm confident John will be a more reliable buyer and give me my minimum value."
