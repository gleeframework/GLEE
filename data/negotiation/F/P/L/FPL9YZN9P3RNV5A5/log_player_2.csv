"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is immense, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price.  It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still allows you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $950,000 to make this work. Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high. You want to save as much as possible. There's room for further negotiation before you consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
