Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding the value you place on it. While we aim to accommodate all our customers, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $70. Our product's unique features and high-quality craftsmanship justify a price point of $145. However, I would like to propose a compromise at $120, which still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a great deal. I hope this meets within your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 120}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for quality, but I've set a budget of $80 for this purchase. Can you meet me at $90? I'm willing to make a decision today, and I think $90 is a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.
