"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000. How about we meet in the middle at $13750? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",13750.0,Bob,4,
