"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  It's also a good starting point for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000. How about we meet in the middle at $13750? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $13,750 isn't my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $12,000, and we're getting closer to a deal.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a good time to take this offer and secure the sale. There's always a risk in continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether."
