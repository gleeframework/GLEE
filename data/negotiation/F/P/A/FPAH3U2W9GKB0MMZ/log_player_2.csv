Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $14,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still above what he's willing to pay at this point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and has the opportunity to potentially get an even better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 13750}
