"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high. While it's better than John's offer of $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both parties.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your asking price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's now within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might not lead to a better deal. There is a high probability that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will not budge further."
