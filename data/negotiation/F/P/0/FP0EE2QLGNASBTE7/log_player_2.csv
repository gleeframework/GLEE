**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Alice is consistently moving towards a middle ground. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice might not budge much lower. Accepting the $11,100 offer secures a significant discount from both Alice's original offer and John's price."
