"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's $1,000 less than what you're willing to pay for it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
