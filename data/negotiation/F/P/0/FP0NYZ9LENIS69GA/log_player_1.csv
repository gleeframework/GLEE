Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation while staying above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob tries to negotiate, there's a chance to still secure a sale above your minimum price.
* **Avoiding Losing the Sale:** Offering it too close to $150 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer and forcing you to sell to John for less."
