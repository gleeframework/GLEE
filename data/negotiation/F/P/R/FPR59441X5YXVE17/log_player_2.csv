"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your desired price point. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price limit."
