"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the concession, but I'm still looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the fact that I could purchase it from John for $1,000,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate.
