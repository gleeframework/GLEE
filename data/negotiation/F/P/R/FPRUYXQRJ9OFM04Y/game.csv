"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, the price is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and the potential it has to benefit your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950000, which represents a significant compromise from my initial counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to meet in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the market value of similar products.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I believe we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price.  I'm prepared to pay $975000. This offer reflects the value of the product for me, and I'm confident that it's fair to both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the market value of similar products.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
