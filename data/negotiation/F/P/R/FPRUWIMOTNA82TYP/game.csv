,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a great deal for a product of this value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $10000. How about $9000? I'm willing to meet you halfway",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500.  Let's close this deal, it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $9500 is a bit high. How about $9000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really want to stay under $9500",9000.0,Bob,6,
