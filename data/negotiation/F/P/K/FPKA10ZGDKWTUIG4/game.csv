"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential ROI. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
