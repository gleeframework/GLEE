"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I value the product at $1,200,000, I'm aware Bob values it at $800,000. My initial offer, though high, acknowledges that the product holds significant value for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves a substantial margin for negotiation, potentially allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind the option to sell to John for my minimum price, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round with a price closer to my target, while still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,030,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1030000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial offer, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not dropping the price too drastically, as I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price that reflects the product's worth.
* **Justification:** By framing the counteroffer as a ""middle ground,"" I'm emphasizing fairness and collaboration.
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, I'm becoming slightly more flexible to try and secure a deal within the 10-round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is increasing, but at a very slow pace. We are still significantly apart, and I need to encourage larger concessions from him. 
* **John Option:** The guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is becoming more appealing, especially as Bob's offers are increasing very slowly.
* **Time:** We are approaching the halfway point in our negotiations. I need to signal that my price is firming up. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but it will be a smaller move to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves little room for further negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  I'm signaling to Bob that I'm reaching my limit. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure to make a decision.
* **Mentioning Another Buyer (without bluff):**  This introduces a sense of urgency and competition without explicitly lying about John's offer.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value while subtly suggesting that Bob might miss out if he doesn't agree to the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a round number, which often feels more final and significant in negotiations. It also gives Bob a $50,000 increase from his last offer to consider. 

This is a pivotal point in the negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and limited-time nature of this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $975,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Bob is sticking to small increments and seems unwilling to move significantly towards my price.
* **Limited Time:** We are past the halfway point of the rounds, and the progress is too slow. The risk of ending up with a less favorable outcome increases with each passing round.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer and even my ""final offer"" of $1,000,000.

It's clear that Bob is trying to get the best possible deal, which is understandable. However,  prolonging the negotiation with him brings the risk of a smaller profit or even losing the guaranteed sale to John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed value with John."
