"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my target price. How about $1,225,000?  This is closer to my budget and hopefully a good compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
