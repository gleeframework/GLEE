"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product.  What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm still interested but $18500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $18000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",18000.0,Bob,4,
