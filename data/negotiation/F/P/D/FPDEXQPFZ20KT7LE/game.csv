"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $16500. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
