Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, getting you closer to your guaranteed price. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other potential buyers. Given its unique value, I'm initially setting the price at $13,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting above your minimum ($13,500) gives you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating your reasons, hinting at the ""unique value"" subtly justifies the higher price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get more than your minimum!
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You can gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere between $12,000 and $13,500.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed with the guaranteed sale to John at $12,000."
