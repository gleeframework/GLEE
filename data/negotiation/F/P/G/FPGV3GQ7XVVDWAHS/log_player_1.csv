"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value to Bob, which can help build trust and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm going to reject and counteroffer to keep the negotiation going. There's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $875,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. While it's still slightly below my initial desired price, it's close enough to my minimum value and secures a sale.  The negotiation has been successful, and it's time to close the deal."
