"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $12,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to meet you at $8,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've got to offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we aim for $10,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
