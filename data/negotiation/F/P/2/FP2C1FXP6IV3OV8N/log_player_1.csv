Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but it also reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm confident that the product is worth at least $15,000 to Bob since it's worth $10,000 to me, and he's a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is too low for me. It's below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a better price, either from Bob or from John. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still a price that's reasonable for me, given the product's value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but also high enough to ensure a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still not ideal. I'm hoping for a little more, but I also want to avoid going back and forth too many times with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500.  This is a significant compromise, as it's only $500 above my minimum price. However, I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price, especially compared to his last offer of $9,500.  If he rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000 and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's clear that Bob and I aren't going to come to an agreement on a price that's acceptable to both of us. John's offer is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is better than the risk of continued negotiation with Bob."
