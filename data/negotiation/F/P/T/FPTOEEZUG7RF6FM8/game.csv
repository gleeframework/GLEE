"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a great deal on the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit above that number. I can offer you a slight discount to $8,500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
