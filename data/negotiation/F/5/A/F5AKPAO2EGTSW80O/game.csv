"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value of this item.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already factoring in negotiation.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer for this round.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
