"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $800,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value of this item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already factoring in negotiation.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer for this round."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now showing more flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer.  I'll counteroffer in hopes of getting closer to at least $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still above my comfortable spending limit. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer, and at $1,300,000 it's now a reasonable gain over John's offer of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether."
