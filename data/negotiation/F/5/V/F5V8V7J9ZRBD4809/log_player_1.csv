"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my goal with further negotiation."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hesitant to settle for that amount. I'm confident I can get a better offer with more negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $10,500. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to make a lower offer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob. I've made several concessions, but he's still not willing to meet my minimum price. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
