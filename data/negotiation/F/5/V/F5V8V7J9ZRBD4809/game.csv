"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,050 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to move forward.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $10,500. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
