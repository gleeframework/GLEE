"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have secured a buyer at a slightly higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000 and the price John offers. It makes the most sense to go with your alternative option."
