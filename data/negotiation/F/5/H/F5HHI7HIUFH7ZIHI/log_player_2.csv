**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $14000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's closer, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
