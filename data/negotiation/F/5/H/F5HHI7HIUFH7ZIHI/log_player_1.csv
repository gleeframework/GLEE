{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $20,000. I believe it's a great value, and I think you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. It also uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  

This strategy balances the need to maximize your profits with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and possibly leading to a longer negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $20000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for you.  

While you could potentially sell to John for $15,000, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for the possibility of a higher counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price above your minimum.  The message reiterates the value of the product and highlights the discount to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $17000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm happy to pay $15500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it a profitable deal for you.  While you could potentially negotiate further or sell to John, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or a potential loss of the deal."
