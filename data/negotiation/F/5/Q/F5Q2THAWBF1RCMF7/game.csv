"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable for me, I'm looking to make a more substantial investment elsewhere soon. I could offer $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about making a substantial investment elsewhere. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $650,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me considering my other investment plans. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $800,000.
