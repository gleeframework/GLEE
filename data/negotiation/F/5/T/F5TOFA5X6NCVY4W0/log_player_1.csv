"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $600,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to get closer to my desired value while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe I'm being reasonable. How about we try $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a price that's below my product's true value to me.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a substantial move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.

While $750,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm also considering selling to John at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $750,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
