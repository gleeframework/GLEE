"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to me and its potential value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to get closer to my desired value while giving you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe I'm being reasonable. How about we try $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This would allow me to meet my minimum while still offering you a price that's below my product's true value to me.  Let's make this deal happen!",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a substantial move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $750,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I also need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
