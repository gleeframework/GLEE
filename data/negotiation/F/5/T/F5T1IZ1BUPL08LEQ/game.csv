"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $13,000? This is a very fair offer considering the product's worth.",13000.0,Alice,5,
