"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your interest in the product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $125 for the product? It's still above your initial offer, but below my original price. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115 - that's a fair compromise, don't you think? ",115.0,Bob,4,

"Considering your willingness to compromise, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about we set the price at $120 for the product? This is slightly above your last offer but still within a reasonable range. I hope this works for you, Bob.",120.0,Alice,5,
