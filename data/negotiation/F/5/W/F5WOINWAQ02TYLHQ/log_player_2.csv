"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,500 is way above his budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not sure I can go that high. $15,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000. If you can come down a little more, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your situation.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but I need to stay at least at $14,500.  This is a great price for both of us and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit.  He's already offered $14,000 and Alice is only willing to go down to $14,500.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice.  Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within his budget and a much better deal than what Alice is offering."
