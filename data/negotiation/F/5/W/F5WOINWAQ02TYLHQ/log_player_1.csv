"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob can make him more interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a lower price, but one that's still profitable for me.
* **Selling to John is an Option:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:**  I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that the price is ""a great deal for both of us,"" which can make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not willing to go much lower, as I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not sure I can go that high. $15,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000. If you can come down a little more, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm tempted to accept, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate. I think there's still a chance he'll go a little higher. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:** I'm aware I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but I need to stay at least at $14,500.  This is a great price for both of us and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I emphasize that this price is ""great for both of us"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to go much lower, as I can always sell to John for $15,000."
