"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! ",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not sure I can go that high. $15,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000. If you can come down a little more, we can close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your situation.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but I need to stay at least at $14,500.  This is a great price for both of us and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
