"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $85 for this product.  It's really a great deal at that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firm on $85, and while it's close to our $80 limit, we have a guaranteed option with John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
