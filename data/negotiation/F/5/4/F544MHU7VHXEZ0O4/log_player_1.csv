"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Confident Tone:**  My message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive.  
* **Openness to Discussion:** I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for further negotiation. While accepting would secure a profit, I believe I can push for a higher price closer to his initial offer. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a tempting alternative, but I'll leverage the remaining rounds to explore a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  How about we meet halfway between our offers at $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offers, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming high. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Framing this as a fair compromise encourages Bob to view the offer positively.
* **Maintain Confidence:**  My language continues to reflect a belief in the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to re-evaluate his perception. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while inching closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my financial constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significantly Above My Minimum:** This offer secures a healthy profit of $75,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Trend:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating his serious interest in the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a slight chance I could extract a bit more in further rounds, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases. Accepting now locks in a great price. 

Overall, this offer represents a favorable outcome, and accepting now minimizes potential downsides."
