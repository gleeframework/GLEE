Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think $130 is a fair price, considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, I'm aiming for a price that's:

* **Profitable for me:** Significantly above my minimum of $100.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  Below his perceived value of $150, giving him a good deal.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
