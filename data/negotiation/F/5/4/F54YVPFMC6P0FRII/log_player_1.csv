Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.

Bob's offer is too low. While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
