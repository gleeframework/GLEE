# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above my target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
