Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a better price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only $5 above her baseline.  It's unlikely she'll go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks her accepting a worse offer from someone else.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
