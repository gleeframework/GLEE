"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's asking price of $1,000,000, Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above Bob's maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves some room for compromise while signaling Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, but it is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $800,000, he can afford to continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. He increases his counteroffer to $875,000, aiming for a compromise halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. This demonstrates his willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000, and it's significantly lower than her previous offers.  While Bob could still try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer or the deal falling apart is high.  Accepting the offer now is the most prudent choice, as it guarantees Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and saves him from potential delays or complications."
