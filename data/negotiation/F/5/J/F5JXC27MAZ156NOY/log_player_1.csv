Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's a gamble, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get a better price than John's offer.  We can adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,700,000. It's a compromise, still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his price point. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal of $1,700,000 in the next round. There's still a possibility of getting a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,650,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate, while still pushing for a price that is closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made multiple concessions. I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with even less."
