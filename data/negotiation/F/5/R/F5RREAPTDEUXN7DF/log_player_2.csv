"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price, buying from John is the same as buying from Alice.  This is a neutral decision, as it achieves your goal of buying the product but doesn't save you any money."
