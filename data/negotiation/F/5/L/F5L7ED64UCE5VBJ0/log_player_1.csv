"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping for a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate better in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good price for you, considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's split the difference and settle on $116. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 116}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting pretty close. I'm willing to go up to $114, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $114
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I've made a few counteroffers and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's better to close the deal now and get $114 than risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for only $100."
