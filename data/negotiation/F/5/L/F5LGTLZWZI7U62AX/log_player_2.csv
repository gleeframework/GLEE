"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer is still too high, and Bob doesn't want to risk further negotiation. It's better to secure the product at a lower price from John than to continue the negotiation with Alice and potentially end up paying more."
