Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate. Even if Bob counters, Alice is likely to end up with a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price $14,999 feels significantly lower than $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

While there's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of going straight to John's guaranteed price."
