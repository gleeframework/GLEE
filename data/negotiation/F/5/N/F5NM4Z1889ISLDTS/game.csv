"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value this product brings.  While I had a different figure in mind, I'm willing to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $900,000?  This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  If we can agree on $875,000, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today.  This represents my final offer, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
