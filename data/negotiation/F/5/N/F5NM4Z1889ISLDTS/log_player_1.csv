"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions ""starting point,"" indicating flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant jump from his perspective, indicating he's quite interested. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price. Selling to John at $800,000 is our fallback option, but we can likely get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value this product brings.  While I had a different figure in mind, I'm willing to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $900,000?  This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We lower our price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The new price is strategically positioned halfway between Bob's offer and our previous ask, encouraging him to move closer to our target.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  Reiterating a win-win outcome fosters a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $850,000, but we still have negotiating power and time.  We'll make one more strategic move to try and close the gap before considering accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  If we can agree on $875,000, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today.  This represents my final offer, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're serious about concluding the negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** We move closer to Bob's price by offering $875,000, a significant concession from our previous positions.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" (John) subtly reminds Bob that we have a fallback position if he doesn't accept."
