"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is not terrible, it's still above your desired price point. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal through negotiation.  You have ten rounds and Alice clearly wants to sell, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a significant investment on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value this product brings.  While I had a different figure in mind, I'm willing to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $900,000?  This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating. There's still room for a lower offer before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  If we can agree on $875,000, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today.  This represents my final offer, as I need to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and we're getting closer to my target price.  While $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, it's a better deal than buying from John.  At this point, I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to negotiate, especially since Alice has stated this is her final offer."
