Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above My Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) ensuring a substantial profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more than John, while still prioritizing a high profit margin."
