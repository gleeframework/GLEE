Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product and believe it has significant value, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Considering the unique nature of this product and its potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.
