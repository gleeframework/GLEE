"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value and my desire to find a deal, I aim to keep the tone positive and encourage Bob to engage seriously.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be mindful of John's standing offer. By starting high, I leave myself space to negotiate down without going below John's offer if Bob is a strong negotiator."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and John's offer. I have room to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm willing to continue the negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly exceptional.  I could consider coming down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, a substantial amount that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, I'm still well above his offer and closer to my target.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's exceptional value to justify the higher price point. This might nudge Bob to re-evaluate his initial assessment. 
* **Compromise Language:**  By using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""reflects the true worth,"" I'm framing my counteroffer as a balanced solution rather than a rigid stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Exceeds My Minimum:** It surpasses my $1,000,000 minimum, ensuring a profit.
* **Above John's Offer:** It's more profitable than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. This is a good price in hand."
