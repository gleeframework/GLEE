"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that still benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to drive the price down, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $795,000? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
