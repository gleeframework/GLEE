"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
