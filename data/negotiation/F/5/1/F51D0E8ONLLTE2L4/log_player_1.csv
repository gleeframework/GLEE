Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price agreeable to both parties. 
* **Above Minimum:**  This price ensures you earn more than John's offer ($100).

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
