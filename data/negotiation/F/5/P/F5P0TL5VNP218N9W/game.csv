"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product has value, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet you at $825,000. I would like to propose $775,000 as my maximum offer for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures you get a valuable product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
