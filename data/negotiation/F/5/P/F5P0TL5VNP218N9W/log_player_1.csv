This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product has value, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is still a good profit, it's not as high as I'd like. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

While $775,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $800,000. I'll counter with a price in between our current offers."
