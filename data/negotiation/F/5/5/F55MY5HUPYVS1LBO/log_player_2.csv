```"

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is close, but to be fair, I can't go below $16,500.  I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is only $1,500 above your maximum budget.  Considering you have limited rounds left, accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure the product while still saving some money. If you reject this offer, you risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John for a higher price."
