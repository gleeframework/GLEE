"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop even lower to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still a little over my budget at $11,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Although there's a chance Alice might be willing to drop lower in future rounds, there's no guarantee. At this point, Bob has already rejected three offers and has limited rounds left. It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Alice."
