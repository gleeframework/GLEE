,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $900000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's try $980000. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $920000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's try $970000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",970000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $970000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,10,
