"Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's try $1100000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This price recognizes the value of the product while giving you a fair profit.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $1200000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1300000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which represents a good compromise for both of us.  This would allow you a fair profit while giving me a price I can work with.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1300000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm sticking to my guns. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
