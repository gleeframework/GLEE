"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $120 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the cost below $130. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $125? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
