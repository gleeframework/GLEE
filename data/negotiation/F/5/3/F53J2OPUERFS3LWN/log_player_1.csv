Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting at $1,150,000 anchors the negotiation closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that Bob has the first chance creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion if he doesn't act. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the language implies the product's worth exceeds the asking price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering a price Bob might consider, given that it's significantly less than your guaranteed sale to John."
