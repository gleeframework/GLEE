Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This gives you leverage with Bob. You can aim high, knowing you have a safety net if Bob declines.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:**  You want to frame the offer positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential.""
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  A 25% markup ($200,000 profit) is significant but justifiable if you can convey the product's worth.
* **Clear Call to Action:** End with a simple statement encouraging Bob to respond.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we don't know his financial situation or how much he's willing to spend. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place will be crucial.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
