"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's my highest offer for now.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $85 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $82.50. That's my final offer.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $82.50 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $86.25? This is a fair price that's in both of our best interests. Let's close this deal.",86.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $82.50. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at that price.",82.5,Bob,6,
