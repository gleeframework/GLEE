Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (anything less and you're better off with John)
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but leaves you with a profit. Since Bob values the product at $800,000,  going slightly below this price could entice him while still netting you a gain.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $790,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it brings."", 
""product_price"": 790000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  We keep it positive, emphasizing the product's value.
* **The Price:** $790,000 is a strategic discount. It's likely to be very appealing to Bob, as he's getting a $10,000 discount.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong long-term relationship with Bob is important, a smaller profit margin for a smoother deal might be worthwhile."
