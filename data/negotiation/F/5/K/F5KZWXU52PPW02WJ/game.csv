"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, this product's unique value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still presenting a good deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product's unique value is important to you, but I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more reasonable given the market value of similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to consider your perspective on the market value. To find a middle ground, I propose a final offer of $1,325,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial price while still reflecting the true worth of this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market value of similar products.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
