Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140 for it. It's a fair price, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly above what Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum price. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and also incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell it for that low.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would still give you a good price, and it would work for me."", ""product_price"": 130}
