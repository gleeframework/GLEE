Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't know his upper limit. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strong Opening:** A strong opening offer can anchor the negotiation in our favor. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** We have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring we don't lose out if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and negotiation style, you might choose a less aggressive opening price."
