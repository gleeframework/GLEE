"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this initial offer. You're not losing anything by seeing if she's willing to negotiate further."
