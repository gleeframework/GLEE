"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This still allows me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value to me while giving you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still believe there's room for compromise. How about we aim for $1,250,000? This offers a bit more savings for me than your last proposal while still providing a reasonable return for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
