Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I still feel that $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

How about we aim for $1,250,000? This offers a bit more savings for me than your last proposal while still providing a reasonable return for you.
