Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount you're offering, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is still too low for me. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,500. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob is persistent and I've already rejected his previous offer twice.  At this point, I'm concerned about the risk of losing him entirely and having to settle with John at a much lower price. Accepting his offer at $12,500 ensures a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
