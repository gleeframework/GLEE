Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, it's wise to start with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer of $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a profit for you.
* **Highlighting value:** By emphasizing the ""value it provides,"" the message subtly encourages Bob to consider the product's worth beyond just his initial valuation. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much John is willing to pay. If you knew John would pay $150, you'd be in a stronger position to push for a higher price from Bob."
