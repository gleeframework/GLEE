{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your desired maximum of $1,500,000, but you have room to negotiate. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:** You can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive:** This is your last resort if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum value ($800,000). This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm aiming for a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation active.
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm still trying to get a better deal than what John offers, but I'm also aware of the deadline."

* **There's still time to negotiate:** You've only had two rounds so far, and 10 rounds total, giving you ample time for further negotiation.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive:** You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially getting a lower price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  I'm increasing my offer one last time, showing that I'm serious about buying but still trying to get a reasonable price.
* **Close to Alice's price:**  This offer is closer to Alice's latest price and may encourage her to accept.
* **Limited time:**  With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision soon.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the penultimate round, and I only have one more chance to make a counteroffer.
* **Alice's offer is still high:**  It's above my preferred price, but I'm running out of time to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the product:** If I reject Alice's offer, I risk having to buy from John at a much higher price.  
* **Potential for future negotiation:** Even if I accept Alice's offer, there might be room for renegotiating the price later if the product doesn't meet my expectations.

While I would prefer a lower price, the risk of losing the product altogether outweighs the potential savings from continuing to negotiate."
