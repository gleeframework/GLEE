Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and casual, acknowledging that the product is valuable to me while still being open to negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Start strong:** I'm setting a price that's fair to me, giving Bob incentive to negotiate down.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing for potential back-and-forth negotiations. 
* **Keep John as a backup:** I'm reminding myself of John's offer to ensure I don't settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I can only pay up to $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value ($8,000) than my minimum ($15,000). It's still not in my best interest to accept. I need to push for a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price, hopefully leading to a deal closer to my desired range. I still have John as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. The product is really valuable to me, and I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that benefits me.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and focusing on a ""fair"" price for both of us. I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm not accepting a price below my minimum yet.
* **Encourage a deal:** I'm providing a realistic counteroffer that gives Bob incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I can't agree to $10500, but I am willing to pay $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than my desired price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility that Bob might walk away entirely, accepting his offer is the best option at this point.  I'm not losing a significant amount of money, and I'm securing a sale. While I'd prefer to sell it to John for $15,000, the risk of losing that deal is too high at this point."
