"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I think you'll really benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still too high for Bob. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is a much better deal for him. Therefore, Bob should choose to buy the product from John."
