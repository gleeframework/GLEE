"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
