Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below the value to Bob, but it still ensures I make a profit above my minimum price. By starting high, I can leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a higher price. I still have 8 rounds, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $11,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell.  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but $11,500 is simply too low for me at this stage.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures a successful deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my original offer of $11,000. Would you consider $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure I can push for a significantly higher price. It's time to close the deal and secure a profit."
