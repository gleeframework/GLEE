"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $9,000. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction, while ensuring a reasonable return for me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,
