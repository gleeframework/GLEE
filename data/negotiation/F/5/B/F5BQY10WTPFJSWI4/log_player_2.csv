"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it will greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $9,500. This is a fair offer considering the product's worth to you and my cost. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this. "", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $9,000. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction, while ensuring a reasonable return for me. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, there's also a chance Alice might reject his counteroffer, pushing the price back up. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases, Bob chooses to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he gets the best possible price and stays within his budget."
