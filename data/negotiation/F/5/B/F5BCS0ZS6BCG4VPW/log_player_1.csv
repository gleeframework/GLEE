I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $150,  Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $125.  At this point, I'm running out of time, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
