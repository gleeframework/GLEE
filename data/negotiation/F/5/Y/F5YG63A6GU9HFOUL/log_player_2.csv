{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is way too high. I will reject her offer and counteroffer in the next round."

While $125 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to my target, but I've already had 4 rounds of negotiation. I'm not confident I can get her down to $100 in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100."
