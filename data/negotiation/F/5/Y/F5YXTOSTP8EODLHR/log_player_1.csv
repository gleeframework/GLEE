Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of its value and my financial constraints, I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.
