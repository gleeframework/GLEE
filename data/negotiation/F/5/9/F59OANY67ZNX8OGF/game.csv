"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the value of this product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant amount and shows my serious interest.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
