{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I subtly hint at the product's value for Bob, hoping to make him more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm aware Bob might counter-offer, so this price leaves space for him to negotiate while still being profitable for me.
* **Always the John Option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be firm in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. Accepting would result in a large loss.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob's offer demonstrates his interest, and there's potential for a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **Holding Out for More:** I can likely push for a higher price by counter-offering, potentially getting closer to my desired $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counter-offer is a compromise between our initial positions.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob, subtly reminding him of the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategic Consideration:** 

* This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows flexibility. 
* By meeting him halfway, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal but not willing to settle for too little.
* The $10,500 price point allows room for further negotiation if Bob makes another counter-offer.
* I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below the $12,000 I initially offered. Accepting would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Further Negotiation Needed:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still not close enough to my desired range. Further negotiation is necessary to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a chance that I can push for a higher price by counter-offering again. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests that there's still room for compromise.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $15,000 provides a secure fallback option, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but higher than his current one. I aim to find a middle ground while ensuring that I get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point.  While I'm willing to come down a bit more, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $10,150? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,800). This shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still holding firm on a price point that's above Bob's initial offer but below my minimum. This preserves the value of the product for me.
* **Positive Tone:** I continue using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob and keep the negotiations amicable.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see this as a good solution for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $10,150 price still leaves room for potential counteroffers from Bob. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate further but won't accept a price that's too low.

**Strategy:** 

This counter-offer aims to:

* Show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but not willing to settle for a low price.
* Keep the negotiations moving forward by proposing a middle ground. 
* Maintain a position where I can still sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but no higher. That's my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer is Unacceptable:**  $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a major loss.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has made his final offer, indicating a stalemate in negotiations.  Further counter-offers are unlikely to change his mind.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, accepting his offer would be a significant financial setback. It's best to avoid this loss and sell to John.

**Conclusion:**

Given Bob's final offer and the available alternative, selling the product to John is the best decision. It maximizes my profits and ensures that I avoid a significant financial loss."
