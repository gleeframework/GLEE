"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  By starting at $16,000, there's room to come down in price over the subsequent rounds, getting closer to Bob's perceived value while staying above your own minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, we're still early in the negotiation. There's potential for Bob to increase his offer closer to his perceived value of $8,000. Rejecting his offer now keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial offer but not drastically. A $2,000 concession shows willingness to compromise while still signaling the product's value.
* **Anchoring:**  By proposing $14,000, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired outcome than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation, prompting him to counter with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $13,000 exceeds our minimum acceptable price of $12,000, securing a profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:**  We're already four rounds in. While we could potentially push for more, there's a risk Bob might not go higher. Accepting now guarantees a good deal without risking the loss of the sale."
