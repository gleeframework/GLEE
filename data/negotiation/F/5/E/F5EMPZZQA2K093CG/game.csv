,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and so am I. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm on a tight budget. I could do $78, and I think that's a very fair offer.",78.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $82. This is a good price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity. What do you say?",82.0,Alice,7,
