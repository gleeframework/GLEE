"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still above Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the sale."
