"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it right away. This establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good price for me.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to keep negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better price, or at least get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer, and only $50,000 less than what the product is worth to him.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. We have only a few rounds left, so I need to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept. This is still a very profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher offer from Bob.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob in the final rounds."
