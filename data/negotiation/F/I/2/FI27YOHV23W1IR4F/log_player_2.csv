"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, but I have to be honest, I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is lower, it's still too high for your budget. There's still room for negotiation, so it's best to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing me to stay within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can we meet at this number? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer again in the next round. You're getting closer, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting closer. While I appreciate your perspective, $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to offer $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a successful outcome."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'm willing to go as low as $925,000, but I'd like to propose a 24-hour hold on the offer. If you're still interested after 24 hours, I'll sell it to you at $925,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob!  Alice is willing to sell at the price Bob last offered, so it's a win-win situation.  Although a 24-hour hold might seem like a risk, it's a good opportunity to secure the product at a price that's just a little above John's offer."
