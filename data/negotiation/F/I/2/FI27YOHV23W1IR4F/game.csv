"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, but I have to be honest, I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can we meet at this number?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we're getting closer. While I appreciate your perspective, $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to offer $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a successful outcome.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'm willing to go as low as $925,000, but I'd like to propose a 24-hour hold on the offer. If you're still interested after 24 hours, I'll sell it to you at $925,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
