Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering it's still significantly above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a good deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still provides you with a significant gain, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? This would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,325,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal and we're getting closer to closing the deal. It's also worth noting that we are already in round 4, and with each passing round, the risk of John making a better offer increases. I'm happy with this outcome and I'm sure Bob is as well."
