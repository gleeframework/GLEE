"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* You have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering it's still significantly above your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still provides you with a significant gain, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my maximum budget.
* While it is closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate.
* There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving me more opportunities to lower the price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? This would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
