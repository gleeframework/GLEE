"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as this is the highest I can go at this moment.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a generous offer, and I'm confident it would be mutually beneficial.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in this product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't accept anything less than $975,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable price for this valuable product. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
