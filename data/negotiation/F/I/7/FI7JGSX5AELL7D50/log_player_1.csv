Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us, leaving room for negotiation if needed. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is, but I'm ready to sell to John for $80 if it doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for me, as it's more than my minimum price of $80.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
