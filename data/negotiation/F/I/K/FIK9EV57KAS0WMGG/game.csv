"Bob, I understand your position.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still gives you a good deal considering the value to you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $800,000.
