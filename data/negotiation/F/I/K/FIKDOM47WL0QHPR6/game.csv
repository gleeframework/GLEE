"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15000, which is the maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my original offer of $15000.  It's the maximum I'm able to pay, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into finding the right buyer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
