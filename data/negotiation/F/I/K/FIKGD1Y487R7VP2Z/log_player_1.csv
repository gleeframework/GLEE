Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer you can send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with a perceived gain to incentivize him to accept.  Offering a price closer to $1,100,000 gives Bob a good deal while still netting you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Value Proposition:**  Briefly mention the product's benefit to Bob.
* **Careful Consideration:**  Implies you've thoughtfully set the price.
* **Limited-Time/Other Interest:**  Subtly introduces the idea of competition without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down slightly from $1,100,000 if needed.
* **Confidence:**  Present your offer confidently. Your belief in the product's value will influence Bob's perception."
