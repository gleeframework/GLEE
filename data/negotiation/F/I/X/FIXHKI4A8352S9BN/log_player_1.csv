Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation, as it's below my absolute minimum but still more than the product is worth to Bob.  This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the possibility of Bob accepting the offer.  If Bob rejects, I'll still be able to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
