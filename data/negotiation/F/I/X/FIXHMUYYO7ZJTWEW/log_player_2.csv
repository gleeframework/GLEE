"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering his maximum price. He knows that John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, so this is his best chance to get the product at a price he's comfortable with. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can move on to John without losing anything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price of $8,000.  Bob can try to negotiate further with Alice, or if this offer is not appealing, he can always buy from John at his maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price slightly higher than his maximum budget, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows he's willing to compromise, but also wants to get a better price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always go to John, so there's no risk in this counteroffer."
