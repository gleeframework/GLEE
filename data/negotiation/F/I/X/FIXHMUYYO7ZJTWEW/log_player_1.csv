Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially gets Bob interested. It's also above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, which is crucial to make the deal worth his while.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  I'm still above Bob's perceived value but willing to give some ground to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'd like to earn.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making him the better choice.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's already rejected two of my offers.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
