"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to get the product for less than $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still offers you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your goal, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target of $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a lower price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me avoid selling to John for a higher price. This is my final offer, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and you've already reached your limit of $10,000. It's time to stop negotiating and go with the guaranteed price from John."
