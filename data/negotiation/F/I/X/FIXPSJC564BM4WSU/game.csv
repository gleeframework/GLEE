"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still offers you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target of $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a lower price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me avoid selling to John for a higher price. This is my final offer, what do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
