"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still allows you to profit from this purchase.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
