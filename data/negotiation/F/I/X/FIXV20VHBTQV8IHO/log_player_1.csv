Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000. I know that's significantly lower than your asking price, but I'm hoping we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
