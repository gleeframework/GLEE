"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $110.  You should counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm still within my budget.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price while still being reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but $100 is still higher than my ideal price. I can still get the product for $120 from John, so it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $100 is still a little more than I'd like to spend right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price in between my previous offer and Alice's offer.  I'm aiming to get closer to my ideal price without pushing Alice too far away.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to increase the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $97.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $97.50, which is very close to my ideal price and within my budget of $120.  At this point, it's likely Alice won't go lower.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation and the potential of having to buy from John for $120."
