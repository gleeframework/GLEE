"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a high starting point to leave room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's budget or how much he values the product, so it's worth seeing if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a good amount for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for a price significantly lower than what I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my desired value before considering selling to John. I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob while ensuring I get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that we're running out of time.  I've already made several concessions, and it's unclear if he'll come up to my desired price. It's safer to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with."
