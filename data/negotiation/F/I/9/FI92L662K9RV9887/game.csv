"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I know it will be just as valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and it leaves room for us both to profit.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This price still gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
