"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While $12,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
