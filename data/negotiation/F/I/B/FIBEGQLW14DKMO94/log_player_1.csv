Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my desire for a fair and mutually beneficial transaction."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing for some negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
