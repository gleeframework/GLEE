Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to get as close to that $20,000 as possible, but I'm also prepared to go down if necessary to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$12,000 is far too low for me. It's below my minimum value of $15,000, and I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500.  This is still above my minimum value, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable starting point for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum value, and I'm happy to sell at that price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, it's better to secure a sale at my minimum value than risk a longer negotiation that could result in a lower offer from Bob or a sale to John at the same price."
