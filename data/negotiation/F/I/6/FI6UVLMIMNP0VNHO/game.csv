"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $580000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $700000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this unique product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $700000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $800000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $675000.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle.
