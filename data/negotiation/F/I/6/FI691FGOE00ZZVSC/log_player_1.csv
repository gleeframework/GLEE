Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a profit with John, but it will be less than what I could have earned."
