"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to bargain and potentially reach a price closer to Bob's target of $800,000.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth exploring if a better deal with Alice is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still a great deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, reflecting Bob's budget constraints while still offering Alice a profit. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also aims to secure a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let's aim for a quick resolution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  It's important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $800,000, so it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while staying within my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer shows a continued willingness to negotiate while gradually moving closer to his desired price. $900,000 is a compromise, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a favorable price. This offer leaves room for Alice to potentially accept, but also keeps the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. While $900,000 is still a little lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially reach a price closer to $800,000.  Bob can always choose to buy from John, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair value for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to negotiate and shows his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his target. This offer demonstrates that Bob is taking Alice's counteroffers seriously but is also determined to get the best possible deal. The offer leaves room for Alice to potentially accept, but also keeps the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to come down to $915,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value. Let's seal this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. While it is tempting to continue negotiating, there are only three rounds remaining. Considering the time constraint and the fact that John offers the product at Bob's target price, it's more advantageous to buy from John.  It is unlikely that Bob can reach a price significantly lower than Alice's current offer within the remaining rounds."
