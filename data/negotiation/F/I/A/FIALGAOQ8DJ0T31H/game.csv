"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but the initial price of $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far from my expectations for this product. It possesses significant value that I believe you'll realize. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your belief in the product's value, $1,225,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
