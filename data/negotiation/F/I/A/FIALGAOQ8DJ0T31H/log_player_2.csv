Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far from my expectations for this product. It possesses significant value that I believe you'll realize. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
