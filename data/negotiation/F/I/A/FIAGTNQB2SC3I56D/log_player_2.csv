"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so paying $900,000 is not a good deal. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has 10 rounds and the ability to make counteroffers. There's a chance to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can still buy the product for $800,000 from John. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer Alice with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob is offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing he's serious about negotiating.  
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, tying it back to the product's value to him.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to continue the conversation. 

**Strategy:**

Bob is starting with a lower price point to establish his negotiating range.  He'll likely need to make further concessions, but this first counteroffer sets a strong foundation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** If negotiations break down, Bob can still purchase from John at a lower price.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob still has time to make counteroffers and potentially secure a price closer to his target.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer again, aiming for a price lower than $825,000 but higher than his initial offer of $750,000. This will show a willingness to compromise while continuing to aim for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off on that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer directly addresses Alice's previous offer and proposes a compromise, showing a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting benefits:** Bob emphasizes the benefits for both parties â€“ a fair deal and a quick closing.
* **Focus on the value:**  The message reiterates that $800,000 is a fair price based on the product's value.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strong move.  It is a reasonable compromise that is within Bob's budget and also appealing to Alice as it's her target price. This increases the chances of a successful deal.  If Alice rejects, Bob can still resort to John's offer."
