"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $800,000 if I counteroffer.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off on that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $800000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's offering my desired price of $800,000, which is a good outcome for me.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it saves me the potential risk of continuing to negotiate and not getting a deal at all."
