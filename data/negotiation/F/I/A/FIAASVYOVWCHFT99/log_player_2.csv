"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $12,000. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum price, so there's no immediate benefit to accepting. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. Given your valuation of the product, I am willing to consider a price of $11,500. This offers a middle ground between our respective positions and I believe it will be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's preferred price of $10,500.  It's closer, but Bob can still try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price. There's no immediate advantage to buying from John at this point as the price is the same, and Bob still has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. In light of your proposal, I am willing to agree upon a price of $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $12,000 and only slightly higher than his preferred price of $10,500.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
