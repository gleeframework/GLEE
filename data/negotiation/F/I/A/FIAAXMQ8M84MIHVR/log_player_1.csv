"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John right now would be less profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that the negotiations will drag on and I might end up getting a worse deal or running out of rounds.  Since John is willing to pay $8,000, selling to him guarantees a profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
