"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me, would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $72.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",72.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $72.50 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $68?",68.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $68 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to drop to $70.  This is a great product and I'm sure you won't regret it!",70.0,Alice,5,
