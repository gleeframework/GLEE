"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000. This reflects a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
