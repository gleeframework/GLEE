Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $850,000. This reflects a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
