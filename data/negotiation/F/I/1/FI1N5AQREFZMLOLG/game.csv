"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $750000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $850000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value it brings.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable going.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
