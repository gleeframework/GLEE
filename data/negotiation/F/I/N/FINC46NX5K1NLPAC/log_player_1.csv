"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:** Starting with a high offer of $2,000,000 establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value and opportunity for Bob strengthens the initial impression.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to engage in conversation, indicating willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. Bob might reject this offer outright.  However, the goal is to secure a price closer to my minimum value ($1,500,000) and maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my value and your stated value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I need to counteroffer to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Rejecting Bob's offer emphasizes that I'm committed to selling the product for a price that reflects its true value. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for negotiation.  This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to secure a price closer to the value of this product. I'm prepared to go down to $1,700,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price of $1,700,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth and justify the price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes my desire to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room:**  By setting a price of $1,700,000, I leave room for further negotiation while ensuring a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,700,000 is still far too high for me. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $1,250,000. This is a fair price given our valuations and hopefully, we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my target. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Despite multiple rounds, the negotiation is ongoing. There's potential for a mutually acceptable price in the upcoming rounds.
* **Maintaining Value:**  Rejecting Bob's offer underscores my commitment to selling the product for a price that aligns with its value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that is more favorable to me. I will need to carefully consider how much I can compromise while still ensuring a profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a fair return on this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering our valuations."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price of $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer of $1,700,000, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fair Return:** I reiterate the need to ensure a fair return on the product, justifying my position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I emphasize that this offer is a middle ground between our valuations, aiming to create a sense of mutual agreement.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a strong attempt to reach a deal. If Bob rejects it, I'm ready to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference again and I'll offer $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I'm concerned that further rounds might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is a significant amount and a better outcome than risking further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, I'm confident that selling to John is the most prudent decision. It guarantees me a substantial profit and minimizes the risk of losing a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
