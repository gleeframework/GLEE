Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120 and it seems like he is unlikely to budge further.  I'd rather close the deal now and secure the sale."
