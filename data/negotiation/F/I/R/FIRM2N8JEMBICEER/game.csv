"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount? I believe we could reach a fair agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership, $8,000 is simply not enough for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This price is still fair for both of us and allows for a successful deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $9,500. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to my budget of $8,000? I believe there might be room for negotiation that would benefit both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
