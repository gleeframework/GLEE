Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents the value I place on it, I'm willing to come down to $180. I believe that's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. How about $150? It's closer to my budget and I think it's fair considering your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer now matches John's offer, ensuring you receive the minimum value you've placed on the product. There's no guarantee further negotiation will result in a better outcome, and it introduces the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
