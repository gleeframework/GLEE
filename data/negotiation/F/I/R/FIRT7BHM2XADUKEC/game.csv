"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This is a serious offer reflecting the immense value this represents.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a middle ground. Let me be transparent â€“ this product comes with features and advantages that, frankly, I haven't fully disclosed yet. These aspects significantly elevate its value beyond typical market comparisons.  To give you a better understanding, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll see that once you have the full picture.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
