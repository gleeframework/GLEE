Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a middle ground. Let me be transparent â€“ this product comes with features and advantages that, frankly, I haven't fully disclosed yet. These aspects significantly elevate its value beyond typical market comparisons.  To give you a better understanding, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll see that once you have the full picture. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is still way too high and is unlikely to come down to a reasonable price. You've hit your maximum budget, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
