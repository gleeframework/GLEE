"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable dropping below $10,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,200 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
