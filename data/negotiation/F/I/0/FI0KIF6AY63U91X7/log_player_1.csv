Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Direct Approach:** Since we know Bob's valuation, a direct approach acknowledging it might make him more receptive. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit."
