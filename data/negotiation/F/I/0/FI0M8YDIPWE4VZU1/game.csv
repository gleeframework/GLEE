Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very kind but unfortunately, it's well above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000.  This is my absolute top limit.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your absolute top limit, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you consider $1000000?  It's a significant step up from my previous offer and I truly believe it reflects the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but unfortunately, $1200000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm prepared to walk away and purchase from John at this point, but I want to see if there's any possibility of reaching an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
