"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the last price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
