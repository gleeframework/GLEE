"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is considerably below its worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while respecting its value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential worth to your business.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top end of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
