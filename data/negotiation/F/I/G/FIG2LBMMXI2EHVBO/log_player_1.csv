Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I still have several rounds to go before I need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
