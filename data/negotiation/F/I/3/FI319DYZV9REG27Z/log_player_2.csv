Bob should reject the offer.  While it is closer to his budget, it's still over what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. While it's closer to the desired price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget."
