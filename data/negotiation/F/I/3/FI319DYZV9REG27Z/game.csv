"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand that it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
