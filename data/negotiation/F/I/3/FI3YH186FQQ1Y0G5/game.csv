"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a unique product that I believe will be invaluable to your operations.  My research indicates it's worth at least $1500000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000, a price that provides significant value to both of us. This is a one-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
