Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the product is worth $1,000,000, but I have to make a profit, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down to her minimum price, and it's a good deal for me within my budget. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a better price, and it's not worth the risk of going to John and paying more."
