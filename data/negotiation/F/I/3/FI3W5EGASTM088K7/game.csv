"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the product is worth $1,000,000, but I have to make a profit, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
