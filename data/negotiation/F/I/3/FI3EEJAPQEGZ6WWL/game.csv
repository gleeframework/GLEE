"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm a bit flexible, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I was thinking I could do a bit better than that. Would you be willing to take a small cut from your price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
