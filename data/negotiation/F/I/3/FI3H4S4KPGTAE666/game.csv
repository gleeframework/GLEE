"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $100 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to go down to $105, but no lower. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
