"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for me while acknowledging the value you see in the product. I believe this is a fair and achievable compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $950,000? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and would allow us to close this deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $950,000 is closer to what I need, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
