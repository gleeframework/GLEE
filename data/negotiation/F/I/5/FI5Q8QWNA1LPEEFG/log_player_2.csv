# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that's sure to be attractive. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, giving you a significant advantage. This offer won't last long, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,100,000, you'll be getting the product for less than your estimated value of $1,200,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money while still acquiring the product."
