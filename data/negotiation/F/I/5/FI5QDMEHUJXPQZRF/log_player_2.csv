"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $120 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is way above your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above my budget, although closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  It's possible Alice may be willing to come down further to close the deal, as she's still better off selling to me than to no one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high for me. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
