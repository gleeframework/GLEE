"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it, what do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $75. Would you be willing to come down to $77.50? That would be a great compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $77.50 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $79.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",79.5,Alice,5,
