"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating to bring the price down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,200,000, which is $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's a chance you could negotiate her down further, it's likely to be a lengthy and potentially unsuccessful process.  Given that you can purchase the product from John for $800,000, it's the most logical and cost-effective decision to simply buy from John at this point."
