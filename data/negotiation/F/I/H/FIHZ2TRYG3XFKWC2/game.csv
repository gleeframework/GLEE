"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $8500 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $10000, but that's my final offer. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  I'm really keen on this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9250.0,Bob,4,
