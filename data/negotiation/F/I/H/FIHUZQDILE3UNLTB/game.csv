"I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $8,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,100. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,100. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Alice,7,
