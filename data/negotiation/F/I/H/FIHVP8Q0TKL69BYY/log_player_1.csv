Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
