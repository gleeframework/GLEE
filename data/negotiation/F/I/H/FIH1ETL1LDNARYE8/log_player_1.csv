"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum, I want to see if I can get more.  It's early in the negotiation and I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm not ready to let it go for just $120. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and my budget, I am comfortable offering $130 for your product. This would allow us both to reach an agreement within our respective comfort zones. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is only $5 less than what I'd get from John, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. It's a good compromise, and I want to avoid the risk of him completely walking away or me having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
