"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of you to find a price that's more beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make this worthwhile. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $10,000 to him.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any lower offer and he'll be forced to buy from John for $10,000.  Accepting the $9,000 offer secures a good price and saves Bob $1,000."
