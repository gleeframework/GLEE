Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, great! If he rejects it outright, I haven't lost anything because I have John as a backup. If he counter-offers, we can negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob aims to justify the higher price, potentially making him more amenable to the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
