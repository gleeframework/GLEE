"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
