"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer that leans towards the higher end of the potential profit margin. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant gain. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give me valuable information to adjust my strategy in the following rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind my alternative buyer, John, who provides a safety net at $800,000. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is profitable, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm seeking a more favorable deal. I'll use the next round to propose a counter-offer that aims for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, the value this product brings is substantial. I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on the product's value. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to seriously consider the deal. 
* **Acceptable Profit:**  $1,000,000 provides a significant profit margin above my minimum, making it a favorable outcome if accepted. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm still open to selling to John for $800,000 if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm confident this is a compelling price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  To be honest,  $950,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** This price still provides a substantial profit of $150,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results, and closing the deal now ensures a guaranteed profit. 

Overall, accepting $950,000 is a pragmatic decision that balances profit maximization with deal certainty."
