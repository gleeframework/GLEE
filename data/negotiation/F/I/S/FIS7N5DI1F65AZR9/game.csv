"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. How about we meet at $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750 again, but I'd like to propose a slight discount. How about we try $12,375? I'm making a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12375.0,Bob,6,
