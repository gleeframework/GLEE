``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than his initial offer, I can still do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's sticking to his price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $105. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is unwilling to budge from his $95 offer.  I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial ask.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of continuing to lower my price and getting less than $95 is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This will ensure I get the best possible price for the product."
