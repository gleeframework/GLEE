"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate and get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for $1,300,000 yet.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $1,400,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not desperate to sell at this point and am willing to risk a few more rounds."
