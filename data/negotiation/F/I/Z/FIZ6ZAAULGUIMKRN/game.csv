"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",75.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $67 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $72. It's getting close to the original price, and I think it's a fair deal!",72.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but $72 is still a little bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can both walk away happy.",70.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $73. It's the last offer I can make, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal.",73.0,Alice,7,
