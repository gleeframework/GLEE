"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested, but I was hoping to pay less than $100. Could we negotiate down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be fair for me.",92.5,Alice,3,
