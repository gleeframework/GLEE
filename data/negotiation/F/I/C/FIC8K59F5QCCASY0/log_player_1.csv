{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower my price a bit or accept his counteroffer if it's reasonable.  It's important to keep John in mind as a backup, but I want to get the best price possible from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for so low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm hoping he'll budge a little bit, but I'll keep John in mind if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $115 for this product. It's still a great price for such a valuable item. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $115 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Can you meet me at $110? I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $110. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $120.  I've managed to successfully negotiate a price that's within my acceptable range, and it's important to remember that the goal is to make the most money possible."
