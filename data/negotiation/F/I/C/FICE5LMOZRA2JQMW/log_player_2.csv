"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us - I get a fair price and you get a product that's worth more than what you're paying. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
