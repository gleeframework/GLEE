"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $125 seems a bit steep. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $115 is closer but I'm aiming for a bit more savings. How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
