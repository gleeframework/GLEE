"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $120.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but hopefully, it entices Bob to consider a deal.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100 at any point, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110. This is still a bit above his offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and hopefully encourages him to come closer to my desired price range.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if this round fails, so I'm not under pressure to settle for anything less than $100."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if this round fails, so I'm not under pressure to settle for anything less than $100."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  At this point, I am aware that I can sell to John for $100, so this offer leaves some room for further negotiation.  However, I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value of the product and meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that doesn't meet my minimum. I'm also hoping to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to accept it, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and come up just a little bit. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at this price and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob has consistently offered prices below my minimum, and I've already made significant concessions. I'm confident that I can close a deal with John, which guarantees me my minimum profit."
