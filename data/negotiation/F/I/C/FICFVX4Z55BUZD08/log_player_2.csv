"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or try to get a better deal from John."
