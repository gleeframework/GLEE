Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to propose a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By expressing openness to discussion and counter-offers, you appear flexible and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Alternative Option:** While not explicitly stated, the fact that you're offering it to Bob ""before listing it publicly"" subtly implies there's other interest, which could motivate him to act. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response and your negotiation skills."
