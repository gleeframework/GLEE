"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $900,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice.  I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit over my budget.  Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. Can you see your way to meeting me at this price?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
