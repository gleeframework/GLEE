"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for cheaper. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $110. Would you consider $120? It's a small compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $120 is less than Bob's $150 limit.
* **It's a good deal:** While Bob could potentially get it lower, there's a risk of going back and forth with Alice and ultimately ending up with John's higher price.
* **Alice has shown flexibility:**  She's already come down from her initial $130 offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a good price for Bob."
