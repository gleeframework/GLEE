{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still leaving some room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price that reflects the product's worth to me. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is now closer to my desired price and exceeds my minimum of $10,000. While I would love to get closer to my initial goal, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
