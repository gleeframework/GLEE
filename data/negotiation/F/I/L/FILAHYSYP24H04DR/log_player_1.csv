Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help Alice gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, she hasn't lost anything because she has John as a backup buyer.
* **Confidence:**  The tone of the message suggests value, which can influence perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob tends to be a tough negotiator, she might want to start slightly lower.  
* **Market Conditions:**  If the product is in high demand, a higher initial offer might be justified."
