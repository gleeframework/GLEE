"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,000,000. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
