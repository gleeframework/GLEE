**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within his budget and saves him $100,000."
