# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate you're interested. $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How does that sound to you?

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to take another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my target of $125."
