"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $13,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, you can likely get a better deal. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:** You have more leverage by rejecting the initial offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffering is still the best strategy:** I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further. If I reject her offer, she might be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
