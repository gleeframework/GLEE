"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $850,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
