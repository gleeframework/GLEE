Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $8,200. Let's try $8,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If not, I'm open to further discussion, but I have other interested parties who are willing to meet my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

```

Alice is standing firm at $8,000 and even hinting at other buyers. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $10,000 is too high. Accepting $8,000 secures a good price for you."
