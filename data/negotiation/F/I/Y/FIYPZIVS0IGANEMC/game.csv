"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I have in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My final counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I have in mind.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
