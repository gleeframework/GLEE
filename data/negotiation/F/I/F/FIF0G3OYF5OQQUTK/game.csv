"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and still gives you a good price for a product worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stay under $10,000.  Would you do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
