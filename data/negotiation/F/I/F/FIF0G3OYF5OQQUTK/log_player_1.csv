Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth more to me, and I think it's a fair price given your interest.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  It gives Bob a sense that he can potentially get a better deal, motivating him to counter-offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Mentioning the product's value to you reinforces its quality and potential worth to Bob.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! You've secured a sale at a decent price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You'll need to analyze Bob's counter-offer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if you should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John for my desired price.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is more acceptable to me, but still lower than my initial offer to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and still gives you a good price for a product worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $10,500. 
* **Show Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm still above Bob's offer, but it's a substantial decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating good faith.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's higher value to me, reinforcing its worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! I've secured a sale at a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze Bob's new counter-offer and decide whether to accept it, make another counter-offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stay under $10,000.  Would you do $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further with Bob could take more time, potentially delaying a sale and costing me valuable time.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price immediately and without any further risk of Bob rejecting my offer.

**Decision:**

To maximize my earnings and minimize the risk of a lower sale, I will accept John's offer of $15,000 and sell the product to him."
