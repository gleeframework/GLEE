"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice. While $1,100,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000.  It's a substantial saving for Bob, while still being potentially attractive to Alice as it's well above her valuation of $800,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation without jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  At this point, further negotiation might not lead to a much better price, and the risk of Alice walking away or demanding a higher price in subsequent rounds is increasing. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for Bob without risking a longer negotiation process."
