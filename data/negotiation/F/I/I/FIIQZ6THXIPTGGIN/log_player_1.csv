Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and get a good deal. It's also a strategic move as it shows confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob and what I believe I can get.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm still confident in the value of the product. I believe this price point is reasonable and gives Bob an opportunity to close the deal without having to pay the full $1,200,000."
