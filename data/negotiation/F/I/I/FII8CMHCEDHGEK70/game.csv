"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
