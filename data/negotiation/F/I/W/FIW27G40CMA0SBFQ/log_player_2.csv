"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice or can simply purchase the product from John at a lower price."
