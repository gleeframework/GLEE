Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $990,000, but that's my final offer. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $990,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

While we could push for more, accepting $960,000 is a strong outcome.  It's a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
