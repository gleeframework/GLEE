"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something that could be truly transformative for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is simply too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm firm on the product being worth at least $1,100,000.  I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for your business, and I believe this price reflects that potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
