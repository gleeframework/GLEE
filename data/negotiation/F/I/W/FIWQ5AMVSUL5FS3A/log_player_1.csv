Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob (""fantastic product"", ""I think you'd really love""). This makes him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open ended question:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". This allows Bob to respond with a counteroffer or express his interest.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and then adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider making a counteroffer or selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. Accepting it would be okay, but I want to see if I can get a bit more.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly wants the product, and I know it's worth $120 to him.
* **Counter-offer strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with something slightly higher than his $80. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price between $80 and $100.  I'll likely start close to $90 to see if he's willing to budge. If he rejects again, I'll re-evaluate and possibly consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a great deal, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language (""great deal"", ""fair price"") to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm stating that the price is ""fair for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm not just trying to squeeze the most out of him. This can help build trust.

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll likely make another counteroffer, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **No more room for negotiation:**  I've already come down significantly from my original offer.  It's unlikely that I'll get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I'll be left with only the $80 offer from John.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $85.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the circumstances."
