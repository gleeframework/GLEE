{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150), leaving room for negotiation. It also presents a positive message to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $98, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $98 is a tempting offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It seems like Bob and I are not going to agree on a price, so I'll sell the product to John for $150."
