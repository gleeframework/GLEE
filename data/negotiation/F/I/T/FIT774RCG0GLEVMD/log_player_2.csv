The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130. It's better to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.
