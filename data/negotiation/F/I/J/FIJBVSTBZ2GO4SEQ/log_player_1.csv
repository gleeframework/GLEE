"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer,  $20,000, to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. This gives me room to lower the price if needed.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500.  This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer of $14,000 yet. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still want to secure a price closer to my value.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm tempted to keep trying, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm confident John will buy the product at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him and avoid any further risk."
