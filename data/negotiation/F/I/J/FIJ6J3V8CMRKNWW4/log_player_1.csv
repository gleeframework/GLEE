Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, offering slightly below your absolute minimum leaves a sliver of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  getting you even closer to your desired profit.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting Bob's potential interest rather than focusing on the price."
