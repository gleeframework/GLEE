,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $15,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's me coming down significantly, and I believe it reflects the value you're gaining.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
