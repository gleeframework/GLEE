"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm aiming for a better price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $11,000 for the product. This would allow us to reach an agreement within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in Round 4. It's likely that further negotiations will only lead to more concessions from both sides.  Selling to John would be a worse deal at $10,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option for maximizing profit."
