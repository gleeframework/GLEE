Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I need to sell it quickly. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows for some negotiation room while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $100.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""special price"" and the need to sell ""quickly"" might encourage Bob to act fast and accept the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, and this initial price gives you space to potentially meet in the middle while still making a profit. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always rely on John as a backup buyer."
