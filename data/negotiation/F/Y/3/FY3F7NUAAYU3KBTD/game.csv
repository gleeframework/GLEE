"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a great product, $13,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
