"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong initial offer significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if Bob isn't fully convinced of its worth to him yet.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and suggests I'm open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm excited about the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early in the process.  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its long-term potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Showing that I value his input and understand his perspective encourages continued negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Reiterating the product's ""long-term potential"" reinforces its value and explains why I'm not dropping the price drastically.
* **Significant Drop, But Within Reason:** The $50,000 decrease shows flexibility, but the new price is still well above Bob's offer, pushing him to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for a product of this value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's serious. However, $950,000 is still too low, and I'm not feeling pressured to accept just yet. I'll counter with a smaller decrease to signal I'm nearing my limit but willing to negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  I'm willing to adjust my price slightly to $1,025,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from this purchase."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I want to acknowledge Bob's persistence and make him feel good about the negotiation, encouraging him to continue.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The $25,000 decrease is less than previous rounds, signaling that I'm approaching my bottom line.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm subtly shifting the focus from just the price to the ""value"" Bob will gain, reminding him of the long-term benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price for a product of this value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob is steadily increasing his offers, and $975,000 is tempting. However, it's still a significant amount below my $1,200,000 minimum. 

I'm going to take a calculated risk. I believe Bob is very interested and might be willing to go higher. I'll reject this offer, but in the next round, I'll signal that I'm ready to make a significant move if he's willing to do the same."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to make a significant move, but I need you to meet me partway. If you're willing to increase your offer substantially, I think we can close this deal today."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Opportunity:** I'm creating a sense that a deal is within reach but requires action from both sides.
* **Significant Concession, Conditional:**  The $25,000 drop to $1,000,000 is a big move on my part. However, I'm explicitly stating it's conditional on Bob making a ""substantial"" increase on his end. 
* **No Specific Number:** By not giving a specific price, I'm leaving the door open for Bob to potentially offer more than I might have otherwise counter-offered. This is a bit of a risk, but I'm hoping the urgency and my willingness to compromise will prompt him to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $987,500. I believe this is a fair price for a product of this value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is no longer significantly increasing his offer. His latest offer is only a minimal improvement over his previous one. This suggests he's unlikely to meet my target price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I risk him walking away or not increasing his offer substantially enough in the remaining rounds. John represents a guaranteed profit that I'm no longer willing to risk."
