Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me.  However, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and lower than the product's value to him of $1,200,000, I will choose option 1.
