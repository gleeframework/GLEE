"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item valued at $150 by you. Let's make this deal happen! My offer is $130 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is less than the $150 John is charging, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than Alice's, but he's still showing he's serious about buying the product. This offer is also a reasonable starting point for negotiations. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust my offer. How about $120 for the product? This still gives us some room for negotiation while being fair to both sides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is a good compromise. It's below Bob's initial counteroffer of $110, but still above Alice's minimum value. This price allows Bob to save $30 compared to buying from John, and the negotiation is moving in the right direction. There's a chance Bob could get an even better deal with further negotiation, but it's a risk considering the limited rounds and the alternative of paying John $150.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure a good deal without risking too much."
