"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
