"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next offer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good deal and saves me significant money compared to John's price."
