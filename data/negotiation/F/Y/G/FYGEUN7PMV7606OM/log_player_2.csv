{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal outcome. It's worth trying to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to his target price of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now willing to pay slightly more than his previous offer, recognizing that Alice is unlikely to go significantly lower.  Offering $9,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. It's a good middle ground, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000.  While it's not ideal, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a much lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to John is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price within his budget."
