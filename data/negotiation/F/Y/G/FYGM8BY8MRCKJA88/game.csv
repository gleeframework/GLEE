"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price still reflects the product's worth, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and takes into account the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
