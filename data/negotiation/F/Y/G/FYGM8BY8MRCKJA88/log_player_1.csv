Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price still reflects the product's worth, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
