"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's rarity and worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's rarity and worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
