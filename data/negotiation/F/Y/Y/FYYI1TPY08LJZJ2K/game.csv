"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet halfway.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can we meet in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $13,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll accept $14,250.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to you. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're committed to this price.  I'm willing to make one last concession, but I can't go any lower than $14,000. It's a small step for me, and it puts us both in a good position.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at that price, I'd be happy to close the deal.",13750.0,Bob,8,
