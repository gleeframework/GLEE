"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of a price around $1600000. It's a fair middle ground that I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $1550000.
