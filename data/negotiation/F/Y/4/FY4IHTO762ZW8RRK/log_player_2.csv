```"

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

You've gotten the price down to $10,500, which is within your budget, and only $500 more than what you could get from John. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product without needing to go through more rounds of negotiation."
