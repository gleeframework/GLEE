"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
