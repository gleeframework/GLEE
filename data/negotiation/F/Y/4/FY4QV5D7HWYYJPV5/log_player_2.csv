"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, you can potentially save even more by counter-offering. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $95 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $110 to $105, which is closer to your desired price point. While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting her offer is a good compromise. Buying from John would cost you more, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal in the next round."
