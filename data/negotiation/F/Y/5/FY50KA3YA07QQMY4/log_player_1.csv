Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm expecting Bob to counter, so this price allows for back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000, which gives me leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Leverage with John:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target but not being unreasonable.
* **Positive Language:**  Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""mutually beneficial"" reinforces the potential win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still considerably less than what I'm aiming for.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still potential to raise the price further. I believe I can convince Bob to go a little higher.
* **John's Offer:**  The security of John's offer at $1,500,000 provides me with the flexibility to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize that $1,000,000 is a ""fair price"" to subtly remind Bob of the product's value.
* **Clear Call to Action:** I explicitly state that we can ""move forward with the sale"" if Bob accepts this offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages a decision."
