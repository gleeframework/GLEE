"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
