"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
