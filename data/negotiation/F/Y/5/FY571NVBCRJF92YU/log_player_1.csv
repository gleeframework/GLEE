Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
