"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about $760,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $760,000 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle on $800,000? This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
