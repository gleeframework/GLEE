"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $85 is above Bob's maximum price of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $75 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, below his maximum price of $80 but still potentially attractive to Alice. It's important to start with a counteroffer that shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is well above Bob's maximum price of $80.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice as it's unlikely she'll come down to a price Bob is willing to pay. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and doesn't risk wasting more time trying to negotiate with Alice."
