Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, $90 is still a good deal.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that Bob will not offer any higher.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
