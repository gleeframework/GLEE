,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $101. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I'm not losing money. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",101.0,Alice,5,
