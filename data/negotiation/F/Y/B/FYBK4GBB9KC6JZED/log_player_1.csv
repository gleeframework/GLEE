"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me, and you'll be getting a good price."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value he'll receive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives me room to move down if needed.

I'm confident this strategy will lead to a successful deal, but I'm prepared to move to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Fair Price:** I'm offering $105, which is closer to Bob's value but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my bottom line.
* **Reinforce Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.

This approach aims to find a middle ground, pushing Bob closer to my desired price without completely shutting down negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $97 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not yet willing to sell at a loss. I have enough rounds left to see if I can push for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $101. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I'm not losing money. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Maintain My Value:** I'm still offering a price above my minimum, but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get and stressing the goal of finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

This counteroffer continues to push Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
