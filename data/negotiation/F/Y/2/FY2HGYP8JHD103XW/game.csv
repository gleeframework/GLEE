"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $800,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $775,000.
