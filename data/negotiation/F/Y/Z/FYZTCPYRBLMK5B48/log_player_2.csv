# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product to you is $800000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still outside of my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the value of the product to you is $800000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable paying.  While her offers are getting closer to my budget, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and don't risk further negotiations that might fail."
