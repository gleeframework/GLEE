"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  There's a lot of room for negotiation here before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) might seem bold, but it leaves room for negotiation and helps establish a lower target range. 
* **Anchoring:** This counter-offer acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Alice to make larger concessions in subsequent rounds. 

This strategy aims for a deal significantly below Alice's starting price while still being reasonable enough to keep the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your desired range, $9,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,000? I think that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer aims to split the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000). 
* **Strategic Positioning:** It keeps the negotiation moving while staying below John's $8,000 alternative.

By now, Alice should understand you're serious about the purchase but not willing to overpay. This offer puts the pressure on her to decide if she'd rather make a deal or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,500. It's a good compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal compared to the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
