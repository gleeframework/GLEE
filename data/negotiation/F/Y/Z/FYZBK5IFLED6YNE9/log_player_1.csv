Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal is mutually beneficial is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave some room for negotiation (in case Bob tries to counter-offer). 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Positive Message:** The message is direct, positive, and emphasizes the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 is within the ZOPA, leaving you room to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed, while still securing a significant profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more moderate initial offer might be strategic."
