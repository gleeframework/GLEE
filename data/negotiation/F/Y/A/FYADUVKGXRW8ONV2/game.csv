,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $10,250? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
