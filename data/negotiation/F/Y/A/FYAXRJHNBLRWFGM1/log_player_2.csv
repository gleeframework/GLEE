"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and even higher than her own valuation.  It makes the most sense to go with John's offer of $8,000."
