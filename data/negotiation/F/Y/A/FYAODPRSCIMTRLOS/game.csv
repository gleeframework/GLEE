"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
