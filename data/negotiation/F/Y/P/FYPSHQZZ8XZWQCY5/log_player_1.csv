Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a suitable offer for Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant value to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer.
* **Product Uniqueness:**  The more unique and valuable the product is, the more leverage Alice has to aim for a higher price."
