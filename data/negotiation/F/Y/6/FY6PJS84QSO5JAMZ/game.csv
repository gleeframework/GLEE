"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $925,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",912500.0,Bob,4,
