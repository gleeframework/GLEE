# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll recognize the opportunity it presents.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point.  I want to see if I can get a lower price from Alice.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for this product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $925,000 is still a bit high. I'm going to counter with a lower offer and try to close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $925,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 912500}
