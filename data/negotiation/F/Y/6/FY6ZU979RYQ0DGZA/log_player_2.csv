"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it right now. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation.  It's a bold move that signals your serious intent to buy the product, but also positions you as a tough negotiator."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still well below my asking price but reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to your budget, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 remains a viable option if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, and it matches John's price.  You're signaling to Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to go any higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide whether to accept your offer or risk losing the sale to John."
