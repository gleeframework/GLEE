"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still well below my asking price but reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1050000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
