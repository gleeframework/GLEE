"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that I value at least $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

We know we can get the product for $80 from John, so paying $100 would be spending more than necessary."
