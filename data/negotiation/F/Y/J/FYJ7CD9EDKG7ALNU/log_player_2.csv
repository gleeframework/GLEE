Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way over my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $15,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
