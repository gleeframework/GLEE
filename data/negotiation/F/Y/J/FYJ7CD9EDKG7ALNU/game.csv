"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than the $10000 you mentioned. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way over my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $15000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $13500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle at $14250. That's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $14250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13750, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal!",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",14000.0,Alice,7,
