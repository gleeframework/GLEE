Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18000 is way over my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $15000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $13500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not entirely satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $14250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13750, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal!
