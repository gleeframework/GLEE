Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly above my minimum but leaves room for compromise.
* **Appeal to Bob's interests:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, making him feel like it's a good deal for him. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I don't state this as a final offer, leaving the door open for Bob to counter and continue the negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit pricey at $1,250,000, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and even lower than John's offer. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to you.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a significant benefit to you, and a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm making a counter-offer that's a reasonable compromise, closer to my desired price point but still attractive to Bob.
* **Focus on value and benefit:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to justify my price, highlighting that even at $1,050,000 it's a good deal for him.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  While I'm closer to my target price, I'm still open to some negotiation. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again, there's a risk that we'll go back and forth for a long time, potentially lowering the price further.
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.  

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a quick and certain sale at my minimum desired price."
