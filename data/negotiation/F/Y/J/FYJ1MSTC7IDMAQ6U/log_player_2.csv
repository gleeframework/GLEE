"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $92.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
