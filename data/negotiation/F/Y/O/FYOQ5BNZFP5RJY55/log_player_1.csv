"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate, while also showing that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we settle at $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
