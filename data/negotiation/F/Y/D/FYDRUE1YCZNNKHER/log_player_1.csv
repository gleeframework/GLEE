Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Even though Bob has matched John's offer, we still have time to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be sure I'm making a sound investment. Would you consider $1,225,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I need to feel confident about the price.

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,225,000 ensures a profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely."
