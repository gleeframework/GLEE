"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. How about $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting close.  I see you're serious about this product. To show flexibility, I'm willing to accept $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough call. Alice is claiming this is her final offer, but it's still above her value for the product. I'm willing to push a little further, but I need to be prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I need to be sure I'm making a sound investment. Would you consider $1,225,000? This is a significant investment for me, and I need to feel confident about the price."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
``` 

This is a risky move. We're splitting the difference, but it might be too much of a jump for Alice if she's truly at her final offer. However, we're getting close to John's price, so we need to be mindful of our bottom line."
