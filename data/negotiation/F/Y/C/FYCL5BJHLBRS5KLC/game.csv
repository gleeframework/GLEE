"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to offer $1,075,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $1,090,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,090,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,080,000.  This is very close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for us both. Let's finalize this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
