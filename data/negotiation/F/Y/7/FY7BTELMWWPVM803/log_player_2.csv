"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 50% of Alice's initial offer. This might seem aggressive, but it sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully gets Alice to come down from her initial price. I also factored in that I have several rounds to negotiate and can always go to John if this doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have several rounds left and John is a backup option if this doesn't work out. I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a limit. I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, but I believe there's still room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is now at my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting this offer and risking going through more rounds of negotiation. I'm happy to accept this offer, as it saves me the effort of further negotiation and ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
