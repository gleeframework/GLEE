"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and if he doesn't, it's a good profit.  I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually if necessary, but I'm hoping to get as close to my desired value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is far too low. It's less than half of what the product is worth to me. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to stick with $12,000.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping that Bob realizes the value of the product. I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept, but it's getting closer. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product, and I'm confident I can get him to pay closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best possible deal. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer.  I'm not yet willing to sell to John, as I believe there's a good chance Bob will come around."
