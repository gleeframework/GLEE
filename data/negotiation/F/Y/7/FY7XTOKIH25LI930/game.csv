"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you, and it's still a good deal for me.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $109.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you, and it's a good deal for me as well.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. How about we try $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",108.0,Bob,6,
