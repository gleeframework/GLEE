,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and potential",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I believe $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider letting it go for $925,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but I still think $925,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement",825000.0,Bob,4,
