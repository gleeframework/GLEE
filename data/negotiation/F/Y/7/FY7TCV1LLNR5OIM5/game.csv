"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you're placing on this product, but $1,350,000 is still above what I'm prepared to spend right now.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $1,325,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,337,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1337500.0,Alice,5,
