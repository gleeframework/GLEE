Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $130. While getting the product for $130 isn't terrible, we know we can get it for our target price of $120 from John. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and buy from John."
