"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $115, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $112, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $113. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal!",113.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $113 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,8,
