"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1500000. I'm confident that this product can generate significant returns for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the unique benefits you'll gain from owning it, and it leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, which would be $1050000. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $1050000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I think we're getting close to the point where I should consider buying from John for $800000. Can you meet me at $1050000 or lower?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
