"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,500,000. I'm confident that this product can generate significant returns for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the unique benefits you'll gain from owning it, and it leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, which would be $1050000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him. There's a chance I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price, or I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I think we're getting close to the point where I should consider buying from John for $800000. Can you meet me at $1050000 or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's mentioning John and his willingness to buy for $800,000 tells me that Bob is either not serious about buying from me, or his valuation of the product is significantly lower than mine.  I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000 and  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm confident I can sell to John for a better price than Bob's offer.  I will choose to sell to John."
