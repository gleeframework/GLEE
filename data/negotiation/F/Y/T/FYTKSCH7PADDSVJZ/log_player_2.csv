"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,200,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $1,100,000 is a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** You have 7 rounds left, and you've already shown your willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower.
* **Jhon is a backup:** If negotiations with Alice fall through, you can always buy from Jhon for $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is a fair price considering both our positions.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Her offer of $1,080,000 is getting very close to your budget.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** You have 5 rounds left and both of you are showing willingness to compromise.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While you could buy from Jhon now, it's possible Alice might come down to your $1,050,000 offer or even lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there with $1,080,000.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,065,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're continuing to work towards a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,095,000. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to ensure it's worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While she's getting closer, $1,095,000 is still above your budget.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** You only have three rounds left.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price significantly enough in that time.
* **Jhon is the better option:** Buying from Jhon for $1,000,000 will save you $95,000 and allows you to close the deal immediately. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds with Alice."
