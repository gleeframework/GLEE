"Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it would be valuable for your needs as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",12500.0,Alice,1,
