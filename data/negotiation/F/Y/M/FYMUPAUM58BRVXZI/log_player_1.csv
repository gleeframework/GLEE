Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer considering its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always better to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $100,000 less than its worth to him.
    * I make a $100,000 profit above my guaranteed sale price.
* **Clear Communication:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as competitive, increasing the chance of Bob accepting."
