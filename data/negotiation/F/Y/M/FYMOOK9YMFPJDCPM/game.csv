"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to spend a fraction of your initial offer.  How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Could you consider $18,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $7,000,  and I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value this product provides.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget. I can stretch to $7,500.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,
