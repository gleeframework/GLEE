"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for your desired price. It's always best to try and negotiate further before resorting to a backup option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than your budget. You can likely negotiate further with Alice, potentially leading to a price closer to your target.  It's worth exploring more negotiation rounds before committing to Alice's offer or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. My final offer is $1,175,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,175,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer to your desired price than her initial offer, you're now at a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful.  You've already shown your willingness to negotiate and are nearing your maximum budget.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
