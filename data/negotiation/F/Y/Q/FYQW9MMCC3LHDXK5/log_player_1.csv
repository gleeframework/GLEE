Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for room to negotiate. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell for less than that. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to get as close to my target price as possible. If the negotiations stall, I'm always willing to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will show him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product has real value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, but at this point, I'm willing to accept it. I've already made a counteroffer and he's not budging. While I'd prefer more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and possibly end up selling to John for less.  $1,200,000 is a decent price and I'm happy to close the deal."
