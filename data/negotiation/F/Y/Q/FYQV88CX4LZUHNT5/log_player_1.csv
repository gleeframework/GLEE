Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the minimum value of the product to me ($15,000), I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 18,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $15,000. Since this is the minimum value of the product to me, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer and sell the product for $15,000.
