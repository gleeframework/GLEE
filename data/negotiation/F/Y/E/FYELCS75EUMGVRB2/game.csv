"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop the price to $98. This is a fair compromise, and it's a great price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's make a deal!",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",92.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm seeing that we're not quite on the same page yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. It's a fair price for the value you'll receive from the product, and it allows me to stay above my minimum. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,8,
