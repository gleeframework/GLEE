"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for consideration. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that it holds a significant importance to me personally. I understand its immense worth to you, valued at $12,000, and I believe we can find common ground. My proposal is to offer this remarkable product to you at a special price of $11,000. This not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows us to explore the potential for future collaborations. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from your perceived value of $12,000. While her offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
