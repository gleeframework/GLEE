"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This is still a great price for a product of this quality.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit higher.  Would you be willing to pay $115?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to meet my minimum.",115.0,Alice,5,
