"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $9,500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value to you, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $9,400? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but no higher. Can we meet at that price?",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. How about we split the difference at $9,350?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",9350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to make a deal. I'll meet you halfway between $9,300 and $9,350, which is $9,325. That's my final offer. Can you accept it?",9325.0,Bob,8,
