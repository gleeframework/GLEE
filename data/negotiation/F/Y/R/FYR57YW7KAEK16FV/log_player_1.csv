"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high with $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go. It also gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary.  

I'm aware of the $1,500,000 safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to push for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is starting low, but I'm not going to settle for his initial offer. I know the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I have 10 rounds to work with. I want to see if I can push him to a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is inching closer to my minimum, but I'm not going to settle for just a little bit more. I want to see if I can squeeze out another $100,000 or so. There's still a chance to get closer to the $1,800,000 I'm hoping for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm making a final push with $1,700,000. I'm getting closer to my minimum, and Bob seems to be moving in the right direction. I'm hoping he sees this as a good compromise and accepts. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at $1,500,000 rather than risk losing any more potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,650,000, which is only $50,000 less than my previous offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth risking another rejection and having to settle for John's offer at $1,500,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure a decent profit."
