Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  it's always best to aim higher if possible.
* **Understand Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Our offer needs to be attractive to him while still generating a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering the product slightly below John's price leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, pushing the price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and ensuring we have the safety net of John's offer."
