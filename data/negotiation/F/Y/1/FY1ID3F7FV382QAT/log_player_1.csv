{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached round 6, and the negotiations with Bob aren't going as well as I'd hoped.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm worried that we might not reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  To avoid the risk of getting a lower price or even losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my desired value and removes the uncertainty of further negotiations."
