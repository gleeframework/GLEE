Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation and potential for a win-win.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  You're stating your desired price and leaving room for Bob to respond."
