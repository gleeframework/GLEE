"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in it. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay for the product right now.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
