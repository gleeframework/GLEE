"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and it's a good starting point to gauge his interest.  If he rejects this, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not happy with my initial offer being rejected, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to stick with this strategy for a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll still have the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value my product. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair offer and accept it."
