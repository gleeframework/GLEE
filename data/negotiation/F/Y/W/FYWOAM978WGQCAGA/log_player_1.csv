Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I'm aiming for a profit, and I'm confident I can find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a deal, selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant compromise from my initial price. It allows for a potential profit while remaining reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired profit than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my previous offer. It reflects my willingness to compromise while remaining confident in the value of the product."
