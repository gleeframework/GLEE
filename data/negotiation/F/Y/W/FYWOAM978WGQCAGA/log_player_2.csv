"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price. You can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my limit and gives Alice room to negotiate if she's willing to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so I'll try to get a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000, which is halfway between Alice's last offer and my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's a significant drop from her previous offers.  I'm willing to accept this offer because:

* It's within a reasonable range for my budget.
* Further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* There's always a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or changing her mind. 

I'm prioritizing getting the product while still saving a considerable amount of money compared to her initial offer."
