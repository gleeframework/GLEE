Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Not the absolute maximum:** I'm not trying to squeeze every dollar out of Bob, as I still need to make the sale. 
* **Above my floor:** $130 is still above my minimum of $150, so I'm making a profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** A slightly lower price might make Bob more likely to accept the offer. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects, I still have John lined up to buy for $150."
