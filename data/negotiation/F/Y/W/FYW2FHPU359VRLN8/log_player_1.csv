I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to raise his offer a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair offer and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

```

Bob has raised his offer to $12,500, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer. I'm willing to accept this price as it's above my minimum value and getting closer to my desired price. It's not worth risking losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
