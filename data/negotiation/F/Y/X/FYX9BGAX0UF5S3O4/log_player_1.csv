Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for a back-and-forth before you potentially accept John's offer of $10,000.
* **It's a fair price:** The price is attractive to Bob while still allowing you to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original price. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,750 is very close to my minimum and is a significant improvement on John's offer. I'm going to accept his counteroffer and sell the product."
