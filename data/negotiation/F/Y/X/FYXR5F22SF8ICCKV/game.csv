,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $850,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our previous discussions.",825000.0,Bob,4,
