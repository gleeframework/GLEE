"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its market value and the value it offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise reflecting the product's true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects a genuine interest in acquiring the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
