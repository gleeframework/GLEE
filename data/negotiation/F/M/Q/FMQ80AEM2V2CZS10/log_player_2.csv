**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  This suggests that I'm serious about purchasing the product and am willing to pay a premium for it, but still within a reasonable range. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair price and accept it."
