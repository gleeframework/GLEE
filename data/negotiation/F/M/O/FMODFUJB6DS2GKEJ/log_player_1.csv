Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, providing a strong safety net. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. By setting the initial price at $1,500,000, you create the perception of higher value and potential for a significant return on investment for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The high initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It allows you to potentially settle for a price still well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. While the high price might deter Bob, remember you have a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum acceptable price."
