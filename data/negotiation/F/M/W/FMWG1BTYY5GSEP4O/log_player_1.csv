Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** $14,000 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Reasonable:**  It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing you to potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm interested in making a deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer and counteroffering will allow you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $11500? It's a bit lower than your last offer, but I'm really interested in making a deal on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is below your minimum, and there's no guarantee he'll go higher.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safer choice, guaranteeing you your minimum and avoiding further negotiations."
