"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant step closer to your previous offer and I believe it represents a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I understand you need to get a fair price, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
