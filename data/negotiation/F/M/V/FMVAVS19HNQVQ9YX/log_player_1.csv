{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob subtly suggests its worth more than $80 to him."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While we've been negotiating, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a price that's good for me.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150, it's more advantageous for me to sell to him at this point."
