"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500?  That gives us both a fair price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $12500, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10000, so how about $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $12000? It's my minimum, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to buying from John at $12000, but I'm willing to give you one more chance. How about $11800? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",11800.0,Bob,6,
