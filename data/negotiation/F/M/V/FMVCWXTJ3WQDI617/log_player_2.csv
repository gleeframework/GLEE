Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still a bit off from my target price. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can offer it to you for $125.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $120. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $120 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
