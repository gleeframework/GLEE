Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than my minimum, it's very close to my ""fallback"" price of $150.  Since there's a chance that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or a lower price, it's more efficient to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
