Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable engaging with the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not set too high to immediately deter Bob, allowing for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $100?  That's my top limit for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and end the negotiation, I want to see if I can do better.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he really wants the product. I'll try to squeeze out a few extra dollars. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** I'm not risking much by rejecting his offer since I have a guaranteed $100 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. Would you be open to paying $120?  It's still a good value for you, and it would help me out a lot."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer is Not Too Aggressive:** I'm not immediately rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also not dropping to his price. A $120 counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Framing the Price Positively:** I'm highlighting the value Bob gets at $120, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Building on Relationship:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is only $10 less than my minimum acceptable price. This is a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a good chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $100 from John. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing negotiations could take more time, and I might not be able to get a better price. 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
