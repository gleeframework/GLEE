"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $10,000. While $10,000 is lower than John's price, Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and potentially forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
