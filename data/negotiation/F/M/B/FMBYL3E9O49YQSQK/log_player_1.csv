Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to compromise, which could make Bob more likely to accept.  

I'm aware that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's potential for a good deal for both of us.  However, I need to keep in mind John's offer of $10,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $12,000. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about $12,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
