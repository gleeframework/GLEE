Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob the feeling that there's a good deal to be made. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in your product, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1300000 for it.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too much. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my belief in the product's value while expressing willingness to negotiate. This creates a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable, but I'm happy to meet you halfway.  I'd be willing to offer $1350000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only $50,000 away from my initial offer.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit for me, and it's unlikely I'll be able to squeeze out much more in further negotiations.  It's a good deal for both of us."
