Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,400,000 is a significant offer, but it doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's settle at $1,650,000 and close this deal.
