"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than our maximum budget ($1,000,000) and Alice's initial offer. Starting with a lower offer gives us room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the price reflects the product's ""value to me,"" we subtly signal that Alice's valuation might be higher, but we're focused on our own needs. 
* **Polite and Professional:** We maintain a courteous tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has met our walk-away price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation.  We achieve our goal of buying the product within our budget."
