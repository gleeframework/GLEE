Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your life. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $12250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
