Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product_price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to pique Bob's interest with a positive and enticing message. I avoid revealing my minimum price, but highlight the perceived value of the product. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation and a better outcome if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Risk mitigation:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, so I have a guaranteed safety net. 
* **Information gathering:** Bob's response will give me information about his interest and potential willingness to pay."
