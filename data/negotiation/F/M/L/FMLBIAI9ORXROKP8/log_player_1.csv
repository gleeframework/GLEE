Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price point, especially considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $8,000. This allows her to confidently aim high with Bob."
