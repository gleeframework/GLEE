"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me. I value this product, but not at that price. How about we start closer to my budget?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making concessions, but $900,000 is still a stretch. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left and believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to take the risk of not selling to Bob and continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $850,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I would prefer a higher price, I have only 4 rounds left and there is no guarantee I can achieve a better deal. It's important to remember that John is also a potential buyer, and I can sell to him for $1,000,000.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point, as it ensures a sale with a reasonable profit."
