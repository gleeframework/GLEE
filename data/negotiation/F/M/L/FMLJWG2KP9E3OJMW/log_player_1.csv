Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my own valuation and the market conditions, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value both of us are placing on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.
