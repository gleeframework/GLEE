"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're confident about the product, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $10500. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you halfway just yet. I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10500 to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11500? It's a fair deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $10800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $11000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. The product is still available, and I'm sure I can find a buyer who's willing to pay a higher price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
