"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. It's a fair starting point for something with such potential.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my initial investment.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and go from there?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to find a comfortable starting point.  However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose a compromise at $1,225,000.  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to engage in a good-faith negotiation.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me somewhere in the middle. To be frank,  $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. How about we settle on $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's potential and my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your understanding of the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be realistic about its worth. Let's close this gap - how about $1,190,000?  That's a firm offer, reflecting my bottom line.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a touch higher than I'd like.  What if we split the difference and settle at $1,170,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1170000.0,Bob,6,
