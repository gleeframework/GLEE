"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Could you do $10,000?  That's the highest I could go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I need to price it accordingly.  How about we settle at $16,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but are still a bit far apart.  $16,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could possibly stretch to $12,000, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the difference between his offer ($12,000) and John's standing offer ($15,000) is substantial enough that it makes more sense to take the guaranteed sale with John.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a stalemate or a final offer that's still less favorable than what John is offering."
