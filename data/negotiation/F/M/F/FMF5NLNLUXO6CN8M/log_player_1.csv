Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy the product for $10500. This price is still fair for you, as it's above your valuation, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $10,500 is more than my minimum, I can likely do better."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and closer to my budget. Let's make a deal!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $10,750 is a good compromise and significantly higher than what I could get from John. It's time to close this deal!"
