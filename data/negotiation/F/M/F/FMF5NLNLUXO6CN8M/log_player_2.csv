"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be getting a good price for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy the product for $10,500. This price is still fair for you, as it's above your valuation, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11000 to make this worthwhile.  It's still a great price for you, considering it's worth more than that to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate further and potentially get a better deal closer to his target of $10,500. 
* Buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, but Bob wants to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
