"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it leaves room for us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
