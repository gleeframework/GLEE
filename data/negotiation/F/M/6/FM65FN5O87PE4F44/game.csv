"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a bit of a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $12,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of selling to John. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $12,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,
