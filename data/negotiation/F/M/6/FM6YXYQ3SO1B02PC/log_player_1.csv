This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also providing Bob with a possible incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."

This is a fair price for both of us, and it would avoid us having to go back and forth further.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10150}
