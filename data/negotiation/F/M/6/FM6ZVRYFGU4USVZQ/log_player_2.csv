"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price, meaning there's no benefit to accepting immediately. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as you have some leverage with the knowledge that John will sell you the product at the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's value of $10,000. This gives her some room to feel like she's getting a good deal.
* **My budget:** It's still below my maximum of $12,000, giving me some potential savings.
* **Potential for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, allowing us to potentially find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is $500 less than what I would pay John. This represents a significant saving for me.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I can get a lower price. Alice has already demonstrated her willingness to bargain, and I risk getting stuck with a price closer to my maximum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential for a lower price is outweighed by the certainty of saving $500 by accepting Alice's offer."
