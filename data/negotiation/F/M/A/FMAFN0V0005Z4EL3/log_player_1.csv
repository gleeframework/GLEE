Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his increments are too small and he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
