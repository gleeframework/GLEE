Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a bit above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and incentivize him to negotiate.

**Strategy:** 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing I can always lower it if necessary. I'm also leaving the door open for a counteroffer, which will give me more information about Bob's willingness to pay. If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
