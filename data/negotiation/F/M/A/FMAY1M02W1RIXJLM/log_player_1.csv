Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter of my own. I'll also be keeping an eye on John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $18,000 is better than John's $15,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $20,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to  $19,000. This is a compromise, but still a good profit for me.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $18,500 is very close to my last counteroffer of $19,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good profit and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
