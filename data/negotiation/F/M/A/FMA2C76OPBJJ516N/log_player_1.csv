Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to consider these factors:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher starting price might make Bob more likely to counteroffer, but it also increases the chance of a successful sale.
* **Bob's Potential Value:**  If you have any insight into how much Bob might value the product, adjust the price accordingly. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's counteroffers.

This is just the beginning of the negotiation!"
