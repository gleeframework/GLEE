Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth starting a counteroffer negotiation to see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target of $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal for $13,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200.

Alice is not willing to go lower than $13,200, which is more than I am willing to pay. It's better to buy the product from John for $12,000, as it fits my budget."
