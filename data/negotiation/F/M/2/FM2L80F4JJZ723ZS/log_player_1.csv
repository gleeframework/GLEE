Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point before potentially accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still leaving some room for compromise. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and the potential for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,420,000 is close enough to my desired range that it's worth accepting.  It's a bit lower than my ideal price, but it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation with Bob or having to settle for John's lower offer."
