"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $900,000, and I'd like to negotiate a better price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is significantly below the value of this product for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price given its potential. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'd like to propose a price of $775,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $775,000 is still too low. I'm not comfortable going below $825,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's try to find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I still think $825,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose a price of $800,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",800500.0,Bob,6,
