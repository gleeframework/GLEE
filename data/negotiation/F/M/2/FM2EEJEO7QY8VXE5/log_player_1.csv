{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a decent compromise between my minimum price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to encourage acceptance. 

This is a strategic starting point.  It leaves room for negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John for $15,000 is currently the more profitable option.  However, I'm not going to give up on Bob just yet. I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is still too low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and trying to find a middle ground. This helps keep the negotiation amicable. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't meet that price. Could we possibly agree on $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,500 is still too low. I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident that I can either get a higher offer from Bob or sell to John.  There's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too far off for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price above $10,000.  
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. This shows I'm trying to be reasonable and find a solution that benefits both of us. 

This counteroffer is a compromise that might entice Bob to accept. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. Would you consider $10,000 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm close to my minimum price, it's unlikely that Bob will budge further.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, it makes sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  It's simply not worth risking losing a $5,000 profit for the sake of potentially reaching a $10,000 deal with Bob."
