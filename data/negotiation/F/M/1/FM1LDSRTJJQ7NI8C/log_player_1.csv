Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed backup at $80 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Direct:** Clearly states the offer.
* **Positive:**  Highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Confident:**  Presents the price as fair."
