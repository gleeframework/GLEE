"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value and significance for us. This product is worth $1000000 to you, and we are offering it to you at a special price of $950000. We believe this is an exceptional deal that will not only benefit you financially but also align with your needs and aspirations. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but not ideal.** Alice's offer of $950,000 is still $150,000 more than Alice's own valuation of the product.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  As Bob, you can likely get a better price than $950,000 by rejecting the offer and negotiating further with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer signals a willingness to walk away.**  This will put pressure on Alice to make a more favorable offer to avoid losing the sale to John."
