# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to me.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as there's potential to save more money."

I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is still $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000.  However,  $1,150,000 is closer to my budget than $1,200,000. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is still $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my target price, it's still $125,000 over my budget. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up with a price that's even higher.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing I stay within my budget and secure the product."
