"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is still $1,500,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be open to $1,100,000?  This would represent a significant savings for you compared to the product's value to you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is still $1,500,000.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
