"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our unique product to you. It's an investment opportunity that could significantly impact your business. We're offering it at $1,300,000. This is a special deal considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. Let's discuss how this could benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. However, given the unique features and potential returns of the product, we believe it's worth a little more. We would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This price reflects our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while still capturing the intrinsic value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further price increases and could lead to a worse outcome for Bob.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
