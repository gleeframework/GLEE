"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be interested in buying your product for $850,000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it's the most I can afford at this time.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $900,000 is still a bit below where I need to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
