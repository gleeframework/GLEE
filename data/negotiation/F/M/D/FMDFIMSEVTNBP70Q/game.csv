"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
