(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds left, the negotiations are getting tough. Alice is unwilling to budge significantly, and Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. It's clear that getting the product from Alice for a price he's comfortable with is becoming increasingly unlikely. 

Choosing to ""BuyFromJhon"" guarantees Bob the product at his target price. This eliminates further risk and uncertainty in the negotiation, ensuring he gets a satisfactory outcome.  While there's a chance he might be able to get an even lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
