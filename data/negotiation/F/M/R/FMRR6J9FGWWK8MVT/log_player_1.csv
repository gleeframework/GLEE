Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $820,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. I want to push for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $820,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, while still allowing for a good margin for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I want to push for something closer to $900,000. There are still rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? It's a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product to you while still being a fair price for me. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 875000}
