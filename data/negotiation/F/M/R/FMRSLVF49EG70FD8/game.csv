,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal on this great product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm open to coming down to $105. This would be a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this work! ",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a solution.  Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the absolute maximum I can afford, but it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Bob,6,
