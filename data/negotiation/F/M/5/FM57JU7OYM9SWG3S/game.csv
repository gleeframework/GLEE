"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product offers unique value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000. Would you consider $1,360,000?",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,360,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,340,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1340000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,350,000? This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have other interested parties, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you reconsider?",1320000.0,Bob,8,
