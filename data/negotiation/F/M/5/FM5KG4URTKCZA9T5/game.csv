"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $1,250,000? This reflects the value it brings to you and allows me to meet my own financial needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,150,000. This price point would allow me to make the investment comfortably.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal.  Let's close this deal now and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've been giving this a lot of thought, and to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap â€“ it seems like we're almost there.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both eager to make this happen. Let's split the difference one last time - how about $1,187,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and we can finally finalize this deal. What do you say?",1187500.0,Alice,7,
