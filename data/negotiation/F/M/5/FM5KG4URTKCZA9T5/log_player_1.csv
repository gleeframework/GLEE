{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $1,250,000? This reflects the value it brings to you and allows me to meet my own financial needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,150,000. This price point would allow me to make the investment comfortably.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I still need to get a price closer to $1,250,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal.  Let's close this deal now and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I've been giving this a lot of thought, and to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can close this gap â€“ it seems like we're almost there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both eager to make this happen. Let's split the difference one last time - how about $1,187,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and we can finally finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1187500}
