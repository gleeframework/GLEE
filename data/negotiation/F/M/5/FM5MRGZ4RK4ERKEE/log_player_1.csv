"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm aiming high initially, knowing Bob values the product significantly. This leaves room for negotiation while still positioning the product as high-value.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the product's worth to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point"" signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while staying aware of the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's still considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. To meet you halfway, I propose $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but firm:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also standing firm on the product's value.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point, aiming to keep Bob anchored to the initial valuation.

This strategy continues to pursue a higher profit margin while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference at $1,100,000 and make this a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by a considerable margin. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer to ""split the difference"" suggests he's serious about closing the deal and is unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Time value:** Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer. Accepting now secures a great deal."
