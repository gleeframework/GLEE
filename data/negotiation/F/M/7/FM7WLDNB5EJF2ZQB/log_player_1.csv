"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product to him and be willing to pay a price closer to $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum price of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $9,500. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident that this price is fair considering the value the product holds for Bob. I hope this will be a tempting enough price for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,750. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds. I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
