"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product holds substantial value, and I believe $12,000 is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to lower the price further, keeping in mind that he has a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us avoid going to John."", ""product_price"": 11000}
