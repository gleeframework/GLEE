"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible.  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, my goal is to secure a price closer to my own valuation.  This initial offer will give me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. However, it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  However, with 6 rounds remaining, I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm making a more significant concession this time. I'm now closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that this demonstrates my desire to reach a deal while still holding onto a reasonable profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. We are nearing the end of the negotiation and I'm unlikely to reach my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and accept the guaranteed offer from John."
