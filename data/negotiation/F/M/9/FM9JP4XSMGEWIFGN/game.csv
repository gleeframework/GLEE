"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $12000, as that's my maximum. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $14000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. ",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $13500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
