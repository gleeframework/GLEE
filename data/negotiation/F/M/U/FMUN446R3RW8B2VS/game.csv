"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a bit more in line with your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $13,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
