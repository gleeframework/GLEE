,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original price and a fair value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. How about $850,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
