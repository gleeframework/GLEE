"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** My maximum budget is $800,000. By starting low, I can gradually increase my offer during the negotiation if needed.
* **Gauging Alice's Response:** This counter-offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original price and a fair value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still above my maximum budget and what I'm willing to pay.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice has explicitly stated she's willing to negotiate further, indicating there might be room to lower the price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I can always fall back on buying from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a favorable outcome."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm keeping it well below both her current offer and my maximum budget.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My goal is to meet somewhere between our current positions. This offer moves significantly closer to her $900,000 while still leaving me some bargaining power.
* **Time Consideration:**  Each round takes time. By making a more substantial counter-offer, I'm hoping to expedite the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. How about $850,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Won't Budge:** Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It makes no sense to pay more than that when I have a reliable alternative.
* **Time Saved:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could be fruitless and time-consuming. Accepting John's offer provides a clean resolution."
