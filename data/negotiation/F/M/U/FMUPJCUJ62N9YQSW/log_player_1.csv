{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to compromise, which can make Bob more likely to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Enough:** $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving you a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasonable:** It's lower than your minimum value of $1,200,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** This leaves room for Bob to make counteroffers, creating a back-and-forth negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, be prepared to counter-offer or move on to John.
* **Consider John's offer:** Keep in mind that you can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum value, potentially securing a more favorable deal.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming for a price around $800,000 to $900,000. 
* **Assess Bob's response:**  Based on Bob's counteroffer, I will decide whether to accept, reject, or move on to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to offer the product for $900,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original price and a fair value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer of $600,000, showing I'm not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum value.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It's lower than my first offer of $1,000,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Within a reasonable range:**  $900,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000, increasing the likelihood of agreement.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to counter again, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, consider my options:
    * **Counter-offer again:** If Bob's counteroffer is close enough to my minimum value, I might counter with a slightly higher price. 
    * **Accept Bob's counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is within my acceptable range, I might accept it to finalize the deal.
    * **Sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail to yield a satisfactory price, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming for a price around $800,000 to $900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I don't accept a price too far below my minimum.
* **Assess Bob's response:** Based on Bob's response, I will determine whether to accept, reject, or move on to John."
