,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  How about $100? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I think this product is worth so much more to you than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $105.  This is my final offer, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your honesty about it being your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is still a good deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,,
