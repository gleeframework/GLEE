"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still higher than your maximum budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can squeeze out a better price. You can likely get the price lower with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there though.  I can offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and accept $1,125,000 for the product. This reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair price. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us, and I hope you will agree.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still above your budget, but it's very close to your maximum.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, especially considering John is offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is a good deal, and you can save $125,000 compared to buying from John."
