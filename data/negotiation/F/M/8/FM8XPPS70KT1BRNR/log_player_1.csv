This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there though.  I can offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you think?

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still not comfortable selling for that amount. I believe I can push for a higher price and will counter Bob's offer."
