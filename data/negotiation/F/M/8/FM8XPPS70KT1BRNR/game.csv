"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there though.  I can offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and accept $1,125,000 for the product. This reflects the value of the product and offers you a fair price. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us, and I hope you will agree.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
