Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is friendly and encouraging, suggesting a good deal. This helps create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm open to Bob's counteroffers, as I'm confident in the product's value. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can potentially get closer to my ideal selling price. If Bob counters with a lower offer, I can then decide whether to accept or counteroffer based on how close his offer is to my minimum price.  If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is close to my minimum value of $80 and is a better price than selling to John. It's a good deal for both of us."
