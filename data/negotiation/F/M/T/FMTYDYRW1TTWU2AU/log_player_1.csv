"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this aligns closely with its worth and would be a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. My revised counteroffer is $850,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $850,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We'll counter with a price closer to his but still above our minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, let's settle at $875,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency with ""my final offer"" while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price that earns us significantly more than our backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I am willing to consider $860,000 as my final offer. I believe this price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher with both of us stating ""final offers.""  Accepting $860,000 secures a significant profit above our $800,000 alternative and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
