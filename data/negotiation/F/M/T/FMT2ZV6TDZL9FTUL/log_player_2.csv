"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $11,500? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than the previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  There's potential for further negotiation to get a lower price, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
