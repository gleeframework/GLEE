# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to achieve a slightly higher return than my minimum target. I understand this might be a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have a guaranteed buyer ready to purchase at my minimum price.
