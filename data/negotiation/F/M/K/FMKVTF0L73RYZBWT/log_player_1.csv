Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal for you, as it provides significant value for that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing that you have a fallback option with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  While $120 is your minimum, starting with $119 might make Bob feel like there's a possibility of negotiation. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $119 instead of the full $120 might make the offer seem more appealing to Bob. 

**Important:**  This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate further down, or he might reject it outright. The key is to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
