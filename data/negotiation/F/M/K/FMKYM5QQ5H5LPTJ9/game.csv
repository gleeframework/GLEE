"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
