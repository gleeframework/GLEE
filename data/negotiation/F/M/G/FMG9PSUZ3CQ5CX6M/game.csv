"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value I place on this product and aiming to accommodate your budget, I would like to offer it to you for $95. This is a price that reflects the product's worth while also being more accessible to you. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I can afford.  If you can meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $92. This price reflects the product's value while staying within your financial limits. I hope this offer suits you.",92.0,Alice,5,
