"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than Alice's perceived value of $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value I place on this product and aiming to accommodate your budget, I would like to offer it to you for $95. This is a price that reflects the product's worth while also being more accessible to you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $95 is still more than my maximum budget of $80.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further, or possibly proceed to John if further negotiation proves unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I can afford.  If you can meet me there, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $92. This price reflects the product's value while staying within your financial limits. I hope this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  While we're getting closer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $80.  I'm going to take the guaranteed deal with John."
