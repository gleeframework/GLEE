"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is way above your budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best starting point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still too high. While she is showing a willingness to compromise, it's important to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to your budget. There are still rounds left, and you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
