"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating the price."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states my openness to negotiation, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.  I'm open to further discussion, but this is my best starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent at this stage. I believe there's room to work towards a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've made a substantial step down from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value while acknowledging Bob's offer and explaining my position.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's initial offer, but shows movement towards a potential agreement. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, which represents a good deal for me while exceeding Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my $1,000,000 goal and represents a significant profit margin.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer further.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer provides almost the same value with less uncertainty."
