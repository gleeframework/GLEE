"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's important to remember that John is offering the product for $10,000, so I have a benchmark to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute most I can afford, so I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,200 is still above my budget of $10,000.  It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not comfortable going above my maximum. Given that John is offering the product for $10,000, it's the most logical choice to go with him. It saves me $1,200 compared to Alice's offer."
