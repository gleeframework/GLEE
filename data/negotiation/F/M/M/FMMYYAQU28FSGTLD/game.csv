"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute most I can afford, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value considering the product's worth to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
