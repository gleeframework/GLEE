Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
