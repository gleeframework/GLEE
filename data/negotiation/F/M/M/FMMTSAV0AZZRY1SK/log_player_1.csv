Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. 

By offering the product at $11,000, we create a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Perspective:** He saves $1,000 compared to not buying and finding a similar product elsewhere.
* **Alice's Perspective:**  We make a $1,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making it attractive enough for him to accept."
