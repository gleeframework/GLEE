"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's best to start with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and your minimum ($120). This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception of potential value for Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give you insights into his perceived value and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $100 is higher than his perceived value of $80, indicating he's willing to negotiate and potentially sees some value in the product. 
* **Below Your Minimum:** However, $100 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate further and try to reach a price closer to your desired range. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise by suggesting a price that's halfway between your previous offer ($160) and Bob's offer ($100).
* **Above Minimum:** It keeps the price above your $120 minimum, ensuring you still make a profit if accepted. 
* **Encourages Negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could try to negotiate for a bit more, the potential gains are small, and you risk Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and secures a reasonable profit."
