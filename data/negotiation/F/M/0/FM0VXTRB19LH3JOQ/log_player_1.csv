Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a price above your minimum:** $140 is above your minimum of $100, so you'd be making a profit. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** The price is lower than the product's value to Bob, so he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Is not too aggressive:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but also have a sense of the product's worth. 

By leaving room for negotiation, you increase the chances of a successful deal with Bob and potentially getting closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow for more negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
