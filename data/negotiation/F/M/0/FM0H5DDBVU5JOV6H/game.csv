"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, $11,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $13,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
