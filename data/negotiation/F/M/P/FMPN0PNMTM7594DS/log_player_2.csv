"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above your budget. It's worth remembering that John is willing to sell the product for your maximum price, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
