"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum and allows me to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
