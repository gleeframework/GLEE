"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. That's my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I can offer $10250 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,6,
