"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $13,250 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $12,750?  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to close the deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider $12,800? It's a fair price, allows us both to come to an agreement, and avoids the need to go through further rounds of negotiation.  What do you think?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,900?  That way we can both be happy with the deal and move forward. Let me know if you're interested.",12900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,900 is getting very close to my budget,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and go with $12,850. It's a fair price that's a win-win for both of us and lets us finalize this deal.  What do you say?",12850.0,Bob,8,
