"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible.  $14,000 is more than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest price possible, but he also needs to be realistic.  He's offering $12,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget of $12,000.  He should continue negotiating for a lower price. He still has 7 rounds left and can always buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $13,250 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $12,750?  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to push for a lower price,  offering $12,750. This is a significant compromise on his part, showing he's serious about buying the product, but still within his target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. $13,000 is closer to his target, but he still has time to negotiate and potentially get it lower. He's only 5 rounds away from buying from John, which gives him some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider $12,800? It's a fair price, allows us both to come to an agreement, and avoids the need to go through further rounds of negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but still wants to save as much as possible.  He's offering $12,800, which is a small compromise from his previous offer but still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial price. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product while also demonstrating that he's not willing to accept a price above his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,900?  That way we can both be happy with the deal and move forward. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,900 is a great price and getting very close to Bob's goal, he still has 3 rounds left and can potentially push for an even lower price. There's a chance Alice will get more desperate to close the deal and accept a price closer to Bob's ideal. Additionally, if the negotiation fails, he can always buy from John for $12,000, which provides him with a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,900 is getting very close to my budget,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and go with $12,850. It's a fair price that's a win-win for both of us and lets us finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12850}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is being bold by proposing another price split. This shows Alice that he's still serious about negotiating and isn't going to accept her offer easily. He's offering a price that's very close to his ideal target but still leaves some room for Alice to feel like she's getting a good deal."
