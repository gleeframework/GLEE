"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel valued.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him it's worth a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to sell to John for $15,000, I'm still within the first few rounds and have time to negotiate with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting his offer, but providing a counteroffer with a clear reason. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and not just sticking to my initial price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on Value and Deal:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $13,250 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $12,750?  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While he's moving closer to my desired price, it's not enough yet.
* **Negotiation is Progressing:**  I'm seeing some progress in the negotiations. Bob is becoming more flexible with his offers, which means we're moving in the right direction.
* **Time to Counter:**  I'll make a counteroffer to encourage further compromise. With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to start getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000.  It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price, but not by much. I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that this offer is a compromise, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency to Close Deal:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by emphasizing the need to close the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. Would you consider $12,800? It's a fair price, allows us both to come to an agreement, and avoids the need to go through further rounds of negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, even though he's getting closer. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're in the middle of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds remaining. I need to keep pushing for a better price.
* **Counteroffer to Close Gap:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that closes the gap and allows for a potential agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,900?  That way we can both be happy with the deal and move forward. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price right in between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this price would be beneficial for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Urgency to Close:** I'm subtly suggesting that this is a good opportunity to close the deal, adding a bit of pressure to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,900 is getting very close to my budget,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and go with $12,850. It's a fair price that's a win-win for both of us and lets us finalize this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to only two rounds left. There's not enough time to negotiate further with Bob and risk him rejecting my offer.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Better Opportunity:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and a better deal than settling for Bob's offer.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and being left with nothing is too high. Selling to John guarantees me a successful sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
