{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm hoping to leverage Bob's potential interest in the product to get a good deal. I'll be watching his response carefully and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see how Bob reacts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, but I'm hoping it will be more appealing to Bob, leading to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly higher than my minimum and less than my initial goal, it's still a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks the possibility of him walking away completely, and at this point, it's not worth the risk.  $13,000 is a solid profit for me."
