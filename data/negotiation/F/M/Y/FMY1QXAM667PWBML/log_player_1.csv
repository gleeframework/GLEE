{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement if I keep rejecting his offers.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
