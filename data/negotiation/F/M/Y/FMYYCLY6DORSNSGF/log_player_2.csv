"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is quite high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still lower than John's price of $10,000.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, accepting this offer is the best option.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or that John's price might increase."
