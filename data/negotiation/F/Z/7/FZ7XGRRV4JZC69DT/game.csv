"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise. While I appreciate the offer, $155 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150. This is my final offer, as I can get the same product from John for that price.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
