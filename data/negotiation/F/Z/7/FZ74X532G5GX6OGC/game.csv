,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
