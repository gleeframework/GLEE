Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
