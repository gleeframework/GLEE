Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, the negotiation has stalled at a price below my desired range. Given the limited rounds remaining and the possibility of further price reductions, it's best to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob."
