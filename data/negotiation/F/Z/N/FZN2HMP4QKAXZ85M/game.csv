"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
