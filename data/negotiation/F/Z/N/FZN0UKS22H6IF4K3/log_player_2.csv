"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You can still make a profit.** Even at $950,000, you're purchasing the product for less than its value to you ($1,200,000). 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money while still acquiring the product."
