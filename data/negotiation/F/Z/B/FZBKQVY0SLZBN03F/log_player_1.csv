""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's a worthwhile one given its value. "", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth attempting to get a slightly higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,999 is just below my guaranteed price and might be appealing to Bob as it seems like a ""deal."" Even if it's slightly above his perceived value, the almost negligible difference might not be a deal-breaker.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating that I have other interested buyers, I subtly create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
