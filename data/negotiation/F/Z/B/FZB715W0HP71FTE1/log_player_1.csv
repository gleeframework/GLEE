"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $15,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe this offer is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing quickly enough to get a price I'm happy with. Given the limited rounds, it's safer to sell to John now and ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
