"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $18,000 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go as low as $16,500. This offer stands as long as we can close the deal today.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I am willing to consider offers up to $14,000.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $14,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $15,500, but that's my absolute final offer.  I believe this product will really benefit you, and I'd rather see it go to you than someone else.",15500.0,Alice,5,
