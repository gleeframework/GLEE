Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** While $14,000 is ambitious, it's still a significant profit above your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome with Alice's knowledge of the situation."
