"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to establish a presence within a reasonable range early on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $10,000 to me at most. How about we start at $5,000 and see where we go from there?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is a significant undervaluation, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It signals to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Transparency:** By stating my maximum valuation, I'm being transparent about my budget. This can sometimes speed up negotiations as Alice knows my upper limit.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer leaves ample room for counteroffers and a gradual price increase towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down considerably, $13,000 is still $3,000 more than my maximum budget.  We're making progress, but it's worth pushing further to see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. However, $13,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice closer to the middle ground. The jump from $5,000 to $7,500 shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Still Below Max:** It's important to stay well below my $10,000 maximum to allow for further negotiation.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum valuation. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as I won't get a better price."
