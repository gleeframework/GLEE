"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a game-changer in its industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. It looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional features that will make the product even more valuable to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. Those additional features sound interesting. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500, Bob. I'm willing to give you an even better deal, though. How about we settle on $11,250? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer with the support and training.  However, my budget is quite tight.  Would you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we settle on $11,100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",11100.0,Alice,7,
