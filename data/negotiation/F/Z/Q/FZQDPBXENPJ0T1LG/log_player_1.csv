"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial price.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to lower my offer slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is not even close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000.  This is still a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully signals to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. This price is still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. I still have several rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I still have a firm bottom line.  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price and allows for further compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's higher than previous rounds. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds, I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,200,000 yet. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a genuine attempt to close the deal and accept my offer. If he rejects again, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob. While his offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
