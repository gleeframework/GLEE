(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Your price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay $80, and you can get it from John.  You should reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we say $100 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is closer to your ideal price, you still have the option to purchase from John for $80. There are still rounds left, so it's worth attempting to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm really trying to make this work, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $95, but I can't go any higher."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your price point, but you're still only comfortable with $80. You've already gone through 7 rounds, and while you can try to negotiate further, there's a good chance that Alice will refuse your counteroffer again. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for a guaranteed $80, rather than risk a longer negotiation that might not end well."
