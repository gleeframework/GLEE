Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, which allows for a more flexible negotiation.
* **John as backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so I can afford to be somewhat flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a way to make it work within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my goal.
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum price.
* **Fair compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, presenting it as a compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating the potential value for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Staying above minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we consider $90 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $90 is very close to my desired price point and is still a good profit for me.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation process.
* **Time is valuable:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the deal and move on to other opportunities.
* **John as backup:**  I can still sell to John for $120 if this deal falls through.

While I would ideally prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option at this point, balancing the potential for a better deal with the risks of continuing negotiations."
