"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to let it go for. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. It's a small increase from your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, Alice. However, I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1200000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
