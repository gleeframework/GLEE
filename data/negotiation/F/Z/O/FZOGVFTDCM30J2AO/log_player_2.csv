Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $800,000 is simply too far off the mark.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $1,100,000. Let's split the difference and call it $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unwilling to come down to your maximum price, and it's unlikely she'll budge much more.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
