"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be worth every penny to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value and our time invested in this negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  I'm still a little ways off from that price point.  How about $775,000?  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $775,000 is still not in my range. To make progress, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the movement. I can feel we are getting closer to a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This shows I'm committed to getting this done today.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $812,500 is still slightly below where I need to be. To finalize this deal today, I'm offering you the product for $837,500. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product. Let's reach an agreement.",837500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we are so close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $825,000.  Let's get this done.",825000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but I need to be at $831,250 to make this work. It's a small difference, and it demonstrates my willingness to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward together.",831250.0,Alice,9,
