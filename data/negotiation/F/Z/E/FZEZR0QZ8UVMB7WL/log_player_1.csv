Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate further."
