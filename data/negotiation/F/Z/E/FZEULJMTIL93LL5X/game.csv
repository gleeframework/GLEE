"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is still below what I need, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
