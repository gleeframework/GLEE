"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for my minimum desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to converge on a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired profit of $1,500,000. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price. With 6 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but only to my minimum desired profit. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I won't go any lower.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
