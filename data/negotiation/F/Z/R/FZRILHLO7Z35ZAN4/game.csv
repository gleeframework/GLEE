"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 175 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $135. This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 135. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try 142.50?",142.5,Alice,5,
