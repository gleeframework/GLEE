Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives the impression of a deal and might leave room for a counter-offer that still benefits you.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 allows you to price more confidently with Bob.

**Why not...**

* **Price at $12,000 or higher:** Bob will definitely reject this, knowing he can get it for less elsewhere.
* **Price too low (e.g., close to $10,000):** You risk losing potential profit, especially since you have another buyer."
