Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500. Would you consider a price of $8,750? This would be a fair compromise, and we could close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to set the price at $8,900 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for me, while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations are getting close to your target price of $8,000.  However, Alice is still offering $8,900, which is higher than your desired price. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's more beneficial to go with John and secure the product at the lower price."
