{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is above your target of $10,000.  There's no reason to accept it immediately.  You can counter-offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To further explore the possibility of a mutually beneficial transaction, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice to come down further. There are still several rounds left to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9,000 is still slightly above my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to hear that we're getting closer to finding a suitable price. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $8,900 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a fair profit for me. I hope we can agree on this figure and move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still within your budget of $10,000 and it's closer to your target price than John's offer.  You've already rejected several offers, and there's no guarantee you can get a lower price.  It's a good compromise and secures the product."
