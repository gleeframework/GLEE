"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still give you a good profit margin and would be a great deal for me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer. Our current asking price is based on the value of the product and the market conditions. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This still provides a significant profit for us while offering you a substantial saving compared to the original price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from your original offer and still gives you a healthy profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider an offer of $885,000 for the product. This proposal allows us to close the gap between our positions and ensures a reasonable profit for us, while still being a competitive price for you. I look forward to your response.",885000.0,Alice,5,
