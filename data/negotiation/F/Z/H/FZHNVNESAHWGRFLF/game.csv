"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  Would you be open to $90? I'm very interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go to $100, which is my absolute limit.  If you're not able to come down to that, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
