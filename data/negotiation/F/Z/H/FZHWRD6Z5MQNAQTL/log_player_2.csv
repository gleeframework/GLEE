"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a unique product that holds significant value. I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. My asking price is $1000000. This is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will justify the cost. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to see it in your hands. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as what you can get from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer since you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price."
