Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  Would you consider $800,000 for it? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now stated this is his final offer and it's clear he won't go beyond his $800,000 valuation. While further negotiation is possible, it's highly unlikely we'll reach a price that comes close to John's offer of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes the most business sense to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
