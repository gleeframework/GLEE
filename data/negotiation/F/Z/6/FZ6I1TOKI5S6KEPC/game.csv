"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
