Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows for some negotiation room, but still reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $9,500, it's better to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Given that I can sell to John for $10,000, accepting this offer secures a sale and minimizes potential risk of further negotiation."
