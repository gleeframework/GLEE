"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $115 is still a bit higher than your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within your budget and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option as it's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice, and buying from John would cost you more."
