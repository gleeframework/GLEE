Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will tell you a lot about his perceived value and willingness to pay.  
* **Potential for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down, closer to your minimum acceptable price.

Remember, even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you're still in a strong position with John as a backup buyer."
