Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. However, it's still a substantial profit. I need to decide if I'm willing to risk losing this sale for a chance at a higher price from Bob or settle for John's offer. 

Here's my analysis:

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** Guarantees a profit of $150,000.
* **Rejecting and Negotiating:**  Risky. Bob might walk away, or we might meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Selling to John:**  Least profitable option, but it's the safest.

Decision: While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's a significant profit. I'm risk-averse in this situation.
