"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective,  $750,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a reasonable margin for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $750,000. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. While I'm open to compromise, I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, considering the product's worth. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal at that price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
