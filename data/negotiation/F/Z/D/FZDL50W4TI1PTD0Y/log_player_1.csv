Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $95 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Balancing Profit and Likelihood of Sale:** While a much higher price might net you more profit, it also increases the chance of Bob rejecting the offer. This price aims to find a balance."
