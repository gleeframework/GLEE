"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about the value of the product to Alice, and you can potentially get it for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer. This will provide an indication of her potential flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, reducing her price by $200,000. However,  $1,300,000 is still above my desired price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown flexibility, and I want to test if she's willing to come down further.  $1,150,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price, but she's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me the opportunity to potentially get closer to my goal of buying the product for under $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price. This is a smaller increase than Alice's previous reductions, aiming to encourage her to meet me halfway."
