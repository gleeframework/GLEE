"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1200000. Considering the unique nature of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1075000? It's a fair price considering my initial offer and your last counteroffer.  I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1075000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1100000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a compromise between our previous discussions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
