"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you owning this product. I believe it has great potential for your company and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This price acknowledges your increased offer while ensuring I can achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize a deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than your desired price of $800,000. There's still room for negotiation.  You should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $950,000 is getting closer to where we need to be. However, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,025,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and it also allows me to achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still outside of your budget of $800,000. While it's closer than her previous offers, it's not worth continuing the negotiation any further. At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure you stay within your budget and avoid further negotiation."
