"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you owning this product. I believe it has great potential for your company and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant amount for me and represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This price acknowledges your increased offer while ensuring I can achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $950,000 is getting closer to where we need to be. However, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,025,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and it also allows me to achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
