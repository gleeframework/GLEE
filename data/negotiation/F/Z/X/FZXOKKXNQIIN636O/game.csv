"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. To be honest, I'm getting close to walking away and selling to another buyer who is willing to pay a fairer price.  How about we meet in the middle again at $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
