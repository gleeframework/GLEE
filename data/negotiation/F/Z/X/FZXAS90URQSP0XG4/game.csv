"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still leaves you a good profit margin and is closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
