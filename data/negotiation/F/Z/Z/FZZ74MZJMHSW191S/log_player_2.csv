{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal. There's always the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not willing to come down to my desired price, and I've already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. It's more efficient to buy the product from John at his fixed price of $10,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
