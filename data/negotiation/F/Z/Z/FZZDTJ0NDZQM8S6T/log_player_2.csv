"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good deal, but you can likely get a better price.
* It's always worth exploring your options before making a decision. You should try to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's still within my budget, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. 
* This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer again, and I'll have fewer rounds left. 
* It's better to secure the product at a decent price than risk losing it entirely."
