(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,200 is a significant drop from her previous offer, and it's within Bob's budget. 
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price that's lower than what John is selling it for.
* While Bob could try to push for a lower price, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer, and Bob might end up buying from John at a higher price.
* Therefore, accepting the offer at this stage seems like a good strategy for maximizing savings and securing the product."
