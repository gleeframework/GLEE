"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable in the $9,000 range. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
