Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a real steal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's above your minimum of $120, but not excessively high, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:** It's friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value. 

By starting with a slightly higher price and using a positive tone, you set the stage for a productive negotiation. You can then adjust your strategy based on Bob's reaction."
