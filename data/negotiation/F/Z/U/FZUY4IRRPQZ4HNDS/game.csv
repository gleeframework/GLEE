"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for this product.  It's still a great value for you, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
