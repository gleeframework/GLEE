"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a tempting offer, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to drop my price a bit, but  $12,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. Can we meet in the middle?",11200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise and still leaves me a bit of room to make a profit.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of $11,500. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
