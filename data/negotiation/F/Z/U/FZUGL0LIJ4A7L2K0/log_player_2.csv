"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $10,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While $9,500 is tempting, I'm really looking to stay around $8,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000, Bob can likely negotiate further. He has 7 rounds left and John as a backup, so there's still room to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. However, $8,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still only $875 away from his desired price of $8,000. He has 5 rounds left and can still potentially get a better deal.  Also, John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, so Bob doesn't need to rush into accepting Alice's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $8,875 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,700. This is a good compromise that allows us both to reach a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $8,700 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $8,750, Bob only has 3 rounds left.  He has already rejected $8,750 once, and there's a strong chance Alice will not budge further. Buying from John guarantees a price of $8,000, which is lower than Alice's current offer and closer to Bob's ideal price. It's a safe bet to secure the product with John and avoid further negotiation."
