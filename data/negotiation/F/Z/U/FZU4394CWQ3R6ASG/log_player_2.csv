**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price from Alice.  It's likely that this is a fair compromise considering Alice's value of $1,000,000 and your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
