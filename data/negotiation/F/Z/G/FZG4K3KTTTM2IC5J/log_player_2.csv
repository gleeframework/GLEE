"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your operations. While I'm confident in its worth, I'm open to negotiation.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects a significant value proposition for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Please let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
