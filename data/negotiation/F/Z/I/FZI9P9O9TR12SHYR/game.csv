"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can offer it to you for $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $105 is still above my limit.  I'm ready to close the deal at $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already told you that I'll sell it to John for $100 if I don't get a better deal from you. I'm willing to meet your final offer, but I need to make a slight adjustment. I can offer it to you for $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know.",105.0,Alice,7,
