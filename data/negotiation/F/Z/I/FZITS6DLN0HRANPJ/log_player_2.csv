"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,800,000 is above your budget, and you can potentially get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about buying but also pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

While $1,600,000 is closer to your budget, there's still room to negotiate.  John's offer is a better option at this point, so we'll reject Alice's offer and see if we can push her lower or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

We're splitting the difference between Alice's offer and our target price.  This shows we're serious about a deal but still value a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than our target price.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiations.  We're only saving $50,000 by potentially continuing with Alice, and the risk of further rounds going higher is a concern."
