I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me the potential for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price and gives Bob some room to bargain while still being a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to take the risk of further negotiation. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm happy with the profit."
