"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,200 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,600?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,600 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,800? That's a good deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth. What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can do $8,500. That's the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,6,
