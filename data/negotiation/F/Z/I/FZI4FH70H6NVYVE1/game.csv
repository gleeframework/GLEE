"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $9,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is the same price I offered initially. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
