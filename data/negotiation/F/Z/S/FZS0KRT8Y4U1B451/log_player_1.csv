Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay a bit more. If he rejects, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer him. While I could sell to John for $12,000, there's still potential to get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $11,000. This is still a good amount for me, and it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to come up a little bit.  If Bob doesn't accept, I can still go back to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would prefer to sell it for closer to $12,000, it's getting clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that's closer to my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might lead to an even lower price."
