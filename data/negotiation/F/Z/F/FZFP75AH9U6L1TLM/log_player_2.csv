"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer."
