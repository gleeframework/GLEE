Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. While I see the value in the product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant compromise for me and reflects a reasonable value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear the negotiations are going to be slow. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a significant profit above Bob's current offer and worth taking to avoid further negotiation."
