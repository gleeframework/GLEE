"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the value it holds for you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a final counteroffer. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
