Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to go above $1,030,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $1,030,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller and he's reached his ""final offer"".  Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better result than his $1,030,000.  Accepting John's offer of $1,200,000 is a guaranteed, immediate profit and avoids further negotiation rounds."
