"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in this product.  I'm confident it can really benefit your business. To get started, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its true value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,075,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  $1,025,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need for this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,060,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really struggling to go above $1,030,000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $1,030,000? This is my final offer.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
