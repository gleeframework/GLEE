"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1100000. This price would still offer you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $1250000. This price offers a good profit for you, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's worth accepting to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
