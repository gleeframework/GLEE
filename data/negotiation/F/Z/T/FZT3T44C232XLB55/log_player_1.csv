Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Alternative Option:** I know John provides a safety net at $12,000, so I'm willing to take a risk with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If I knew Bob was very price-sensitive, I might start lower. However, with limited information, aiming high initially is strategically sound.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'm prepared to lower the price during the negotiation process, but I'm aiming for the best possible outcome."
