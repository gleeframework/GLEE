Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
