Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $120 is the optimal strategy. This ensures that Bob will accept the offer, allowing you to maximize your profit. While you could try to offer a higher price, there is no guarantee that Bob will accept, and you would then be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
