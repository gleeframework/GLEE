Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed backup offer from John at your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage with Bob.  You can aim high initially, knowing that if Bob rejects, you haven't lost anything.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** You establish the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** A 25% markup ($200,000 profit) is significant but justifiable if you can emphasize the product's unique benefits to Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a fantastic profit beyond your initial goal.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm to a price above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $800,000. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you can confidently convey the product's value to justify the higher asking price."
