""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant value this brings."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John, so you're not desperate. This strong position allows you to confidently aim high with Bob.

**The chosen price of $925,000:**

* Provides a substantial profit margin above your minimum ($800,000).
* Leaves Bob with a potential $75,000 gain, making it attractive for him."
