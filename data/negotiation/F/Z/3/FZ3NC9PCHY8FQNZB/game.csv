"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be budget-conscious, but $11,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not quite seeing eye-to-eye on this. While I appreciate your offer, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $12,000.  It's my absolute minimum for this product. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",11500.0,Bob,6,
