Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I believe it's worth $150 to you, and to make it a great deal, I'm willing to sell it for $135. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than your minimum ($120).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting with $135 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback option with John at $120, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
