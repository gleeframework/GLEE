"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is more than I'm comfortable spending. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer you $1000000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
