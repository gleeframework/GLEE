"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. I am willing to negotiate, but his offer is not even close to what I need to get.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $9,500 is my absolute minimum.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have a bottom line, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to what I need.  I don't want to risk him walking away entirely, so I'll accept."
