"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider adjusting the price to something more within my range? I am willing to pay up to $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1250000, which still reflects the substantial value you'll receive from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
