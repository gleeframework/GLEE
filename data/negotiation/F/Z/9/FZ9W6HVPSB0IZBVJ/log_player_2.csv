Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm close to your target, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125 and it's a reasonable compromise to save $5. Holding out for the full $120 might backfire."
