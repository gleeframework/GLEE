"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you agree.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. Let's try $13,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
