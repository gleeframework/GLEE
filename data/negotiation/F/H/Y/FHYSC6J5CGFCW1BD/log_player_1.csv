Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and decide whether to accept or counter with a new price.  I'll always have the option of selling to John for $100, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, but lower to show I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's still above my minimum, and hopefully, it will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum and closer to my desired price.  Since further negotiations might not lead to a better outcome, I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
