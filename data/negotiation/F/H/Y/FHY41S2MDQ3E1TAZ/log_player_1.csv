Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $12,000 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Offering it at $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's a significant saving for Bob compared to its value to him ($10,000), while still giving me a profit above my minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob now avoids potential delays of finding another buyer if I were to wait for John. 

This strategy aims to make a compelling offer to Bob while keeping my profit margin high."
