Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before deciding if I want to lower my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not as high as I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise.  It's above my minimum value and  it seems like we're at a point where  further negotiation might be unproductive."
