Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is still above Bob's perceived value, but also gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob gets a good deal, and I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $120, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is still a good outcome.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation."
