Explanation:

While Bob is still engaging, his counteroffers are incrementally getting smaller.  We're now at a point where his latest offer ($1,660,000) is less than our final offer in the previous round ($1,680,000). This indicates that we've likely reached the upper limit of what Bob is willing to pay.  

Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries a risk that he may lowball in a future offer, potentially dropping below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

Therefore, it's strategically the best choice to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
