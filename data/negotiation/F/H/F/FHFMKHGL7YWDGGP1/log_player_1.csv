{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers and presents a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's significance. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $1,350,000  is significantly above Bob's valuation but still leaves him with potential profit if he leverages the product effectively.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a strong fallback option with John, guaranteeing her the full $1,500,000 if Bob declines. This knowledge allows for a more confident negotiation approach.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice has the flexibility to negotiate but should be mindful of not going below her minimum acceptable price."
