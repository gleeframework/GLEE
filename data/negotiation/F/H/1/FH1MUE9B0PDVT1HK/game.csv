"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves room for profit for both of us and is closer to the product's true value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,112,500.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can feel we're nearing a deal. How about we bump my last offer up slightly to $1,090,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can close this out soon.",1090000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're so close!  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
