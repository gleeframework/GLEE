"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to incentivize him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, indicating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is $12,000:** My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, and $9,500 is significantly below that.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $12,000, giving me leverage to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point and hopefully push the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,800. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying relatively close to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""good compromise,"" subtly suggesting that further negotiation might be difficult.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm explicitly mentioning ""finalizing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  $9,600 is still significantly below my target of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have several rounds remaining and the option to sell to John for a much higher price, giving me strong leverage.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting, I can potentially push Bob to come closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I can offer you the product for $9,700. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount from the previous round, showing flexibility while still pushing towards my desired price. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and a ""good deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and value.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's close this deal!"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While closer to my target, the offer leaves room for a slight counteroffer from Bob, keeping the negotiation open."
