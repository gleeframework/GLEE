Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$17,000:** This is a starting point that is above my minimum value ($15,000) and likely within Bob's budget, given that he values the product at $15,000. 
* **Positive tone:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I start with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His reaction will provide insight into his willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I have a safety net by offering to sell to John if Bob rejects my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum value ($15,000), it's still lower than my starting offer.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me an opportunity to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop to $14,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  That gives you a good deal and allows me to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($14,000).
* **Reasoning:** I provide a justification for my counteroffer, highlighting the value it offers to Bob while still being profitable for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm willing to negotiate but not at any price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a strong position:** My counteroffer still puts me in a better position than selling to John at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line.  At this point, selling the product to John for $15,000 ensures I meet my minimum goal and saves me from further negotiation with Bob.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that he might keep lowering his offer, potentially leading to an outcome where I sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John now provides certainty and guarantees I receive my minimum value for the product."
