Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit for me.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is close enough to my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or losing the deal altogether. I'm willing to settle for $1,700,000 to avoid potential losses and secure the sale."
