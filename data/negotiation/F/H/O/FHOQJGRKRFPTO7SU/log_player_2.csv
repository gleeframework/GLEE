Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. It's worth another round of negotiation to try to bring the price down further. He can counteroffer again, potentially closer to $10,000."
