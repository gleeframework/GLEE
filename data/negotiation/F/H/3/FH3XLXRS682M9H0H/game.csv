"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1800000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I need to be within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for it.  This is my maximum, considering the value I place on this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value we both place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1100000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product given our ongoing discussions.  Let's aim for a final agreement and avoid the risk of losing this opportunity.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1150000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering our ongoing discussions. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've been very persistent in trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to push one last time with an offer of $1175000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair value for the product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement that makes us both happy. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider my other options.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
