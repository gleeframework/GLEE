Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and ""potential"", Alice subtly reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and invites Bob to share his thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a secure backup plan with John at $12,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
