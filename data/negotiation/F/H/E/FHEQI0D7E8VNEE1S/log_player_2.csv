"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is $12,000. I am confident we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
