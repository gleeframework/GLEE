"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Alice's asking price of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, Bob has the backup option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum budget of $10,000. This is the lowest price he's willing to pay. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum. He's willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if he can get a better price. If he can't, he can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate the price down, but he's also showing some flexibility. He's increasing his offer to $11,000, which is halfway between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still trying to get the best deal possible."
