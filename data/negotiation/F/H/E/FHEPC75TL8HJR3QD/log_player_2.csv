# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $850,000 is better than $900,000, he can likely get the price down further.  He has room to negotiate, and shouldn't settle yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away. At $825,000, he's getting the product for significantly less than his max price of $1,200,000, and it's only $25,000 more than Alice's minimum price.  This is a good deal for Bob, and the risk of losing the product by going back and forth isn't worth the potential small savings."
