"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's make a deal!",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to you and my budget.  Let's reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
