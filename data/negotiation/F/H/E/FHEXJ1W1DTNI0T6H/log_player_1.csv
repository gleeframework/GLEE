I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum of $10,000 and getting me closer to my initial target. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to do better in the remaining rounds, and I'd rather secure a sale now."
