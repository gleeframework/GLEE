"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $875,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",875000.0,Bob,4,
