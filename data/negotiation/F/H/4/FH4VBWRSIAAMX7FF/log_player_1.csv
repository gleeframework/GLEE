{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and open to counteroffers, which makes me seem more approachable and willing to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm splitting the difference between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting closer to my desired profit margin.  The message emphasizes that it's a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I really think it's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob, it's still below my desired profit margin.  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell to John for $100."
