"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I really think it's a fair price for this product.",97.5,Bob,4,
