"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13,000, which is my lowest price for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I'm trying to find a price point that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
