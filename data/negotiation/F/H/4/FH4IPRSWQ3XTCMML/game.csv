"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my limit. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $980000. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $980000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $970000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $970000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $965000, but that's my absolute limit. Can you consider this one more time?",965000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $970000, Bob. I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $965000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",965000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $965000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm not willing to pay more than $960000. This is my final offer.",960000.0,Bob,10,
