This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still allows for some room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price."

$8,750 is still too low for me. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob higher. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $9,000."
