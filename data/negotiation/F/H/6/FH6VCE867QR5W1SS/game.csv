"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $12,000. Would you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair compromise. This price is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to meet my needs. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
