Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair compromise. This price is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to meet my needs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price.  It's a fair deal for both sides, and there's no guarantee further negotiation will result in a better price for you."
