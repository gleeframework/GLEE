Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits. How about we bring the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget.  I can go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,400,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, we already have a guaranteed offer from John for our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
