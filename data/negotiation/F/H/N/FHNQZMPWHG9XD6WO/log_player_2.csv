"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation."
