"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm starting with my desired price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to see if Bob is willing to meet my expectations.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering a compromise at $1,100,000. This is still a good price for me, but shows I'm open to negotiation. I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop my price too much further.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still a fair price for me.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, and that he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close, but Bob is still not willing to pay a price that's worth it for me. I've already made significant concessions.  Rather than continue this negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and will ensure I get the price I want."
