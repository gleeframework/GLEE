,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go down to $90, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get great use out of the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
