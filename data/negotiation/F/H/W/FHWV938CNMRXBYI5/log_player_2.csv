Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You're aiming to save as much as possible. $90 is still a bit higher than your target.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $85 for it. "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go a bit lower than my initial offer. I can do $87.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're still aiming to save as much as possible, and $87.50 is still above your target.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you another chance to get closer to your target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $86?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can do $88, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is offering $88, which is within your budget of $100 and is only $8 higher than your target price of $80. It's likely that further counteroffers will lead to a longer negotiation process and potentially a higher price.  Accepting the offer saves you time and ensures you get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
