"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's budget.  He has a better option with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still over Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get the price down to Bob's desired range."
