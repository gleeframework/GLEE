I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,000?  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I have 6 rounds left and I think I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $8,750 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make a profit without sacrificing too much. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
