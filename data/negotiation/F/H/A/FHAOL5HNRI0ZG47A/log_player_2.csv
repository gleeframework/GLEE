You should reject Alice's offer. It's still too high for your budget.  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's price but still leaves room for negotiation. You can explain to Alice that you are willing to pay a fair price but that your budget is limited."

Alice's offer is still too high.  You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

You are increasing your offer slightly, showing you are serious about buying the product but still pushing for a price closer to your budget.  You can emphasize that this is a fair price considering the value of the product and your own financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000. You've tried to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but she's not budging.  It's better to get the product you need within your budget than to keep haggling and risk losing out completely."
