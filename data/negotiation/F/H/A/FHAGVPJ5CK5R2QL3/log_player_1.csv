"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price offered can act as an anchor, influencing Bob's perception of what's reasonable. A high starting point sets a high anchor.
* **Confidence:** Offering a confident price demonstrates your belief in the product's value.

It's crucial to remember that while I have a fallback option with John, getting a deal with Bob above my minimum is the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His offer jumped straight to what he perceives as my bottom line, suggesting he's willing to pay more. I'll aim to bring him up without risking the deal by getting too greedy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle: How about $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel like a fair compromise to both parties.
* **Strategic Concession:** By significantly lowering my price from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:**  This price still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price and allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to move on price, and we're now getting into a range that's quite favorable for me.  While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I think I can still push for a bit more before accepting.  I'll try to inch him up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle on $1,900,000? I think that's a fair and final offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit. 
* **""Fair and Final"":** Using this language creates a sense of urgency and implies this is my best offer.
* **Target Price:** $1,900,000 represents a strong profit and a successful negotiation. It's a good point to hold firm unless Bob makes a significant counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in finding a mutually beneficial solution, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I hope this aligns more closely with your expectations while still respecting my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and represents a good profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for smaller gains ($50,000 increments)  increases the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I receive the funds sooner.  Prolonging the negotiation delays my ability to use those funds for other opportunities.

While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more from Bob, it's not worth risking the deal at this point. Accepting his offer is a strategic win."
