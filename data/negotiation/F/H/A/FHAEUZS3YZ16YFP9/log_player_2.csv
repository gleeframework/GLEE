"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value it brings, while still allowing for a significant profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your desire to invest a bit less,  $950,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and potential for this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This allows for a good profit margin for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still quite high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He should reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to his initial offer of $950,000."
