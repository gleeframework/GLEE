"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value it brings, while still allowing for a significant profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair given its value to me and allows for a solid profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your desire to invest a bit less,  $950,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and potential for this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This allows for a good profit margin for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,075,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow for a successful deal.",1012500.0,Bob,4,
