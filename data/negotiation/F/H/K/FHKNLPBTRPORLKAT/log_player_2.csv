"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm completely happy with.  Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you can't go as low as $90, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but also sets a firm price point that's still a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference. How about $101? It's only $4 above your last offer and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to get a fair price. $101 is a good deal, saving $19 from John's price and only a bit over Alice's perceived value. It's time to accept and close the deal."
