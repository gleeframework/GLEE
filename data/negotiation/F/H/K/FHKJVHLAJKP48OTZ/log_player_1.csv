I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,025,000, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's down to the wire, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm concerned we won't be able to reach an agreement in the remaining two rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a safe and secure outcome."
