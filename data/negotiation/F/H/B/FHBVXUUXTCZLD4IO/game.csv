"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
