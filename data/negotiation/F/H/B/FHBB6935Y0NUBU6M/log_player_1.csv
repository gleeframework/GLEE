Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the minimum you'll accept, which is $1,500,000 (because John guarantees this).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  He values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** For a deal to happen, the price must fall between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, but without completely alienating Bob. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have more leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. This product is in high demand and I've already received significant interest. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price, especially considering its potential returns for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value and demand, creating a sense of scarcity. 
* **Strong Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for potential negotiation while staying close to your desired outcome.
* **Value Focus:** Instead of dwelling on discounts, the message emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob's business. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a good relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run."
