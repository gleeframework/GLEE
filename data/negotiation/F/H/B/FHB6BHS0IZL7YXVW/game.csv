"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand you may not know the full potential of this product, which is why I'm willing to let you evaluate it at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth. I'm confident that once you see its benefits, you'll agree it's a game-changer. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from what it's truly worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
