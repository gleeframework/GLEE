Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, and still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get a higher price, selling to John for $150 guarantees me a decent profit."
