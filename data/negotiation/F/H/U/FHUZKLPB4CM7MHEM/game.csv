"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
