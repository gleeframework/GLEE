"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to save some money if possible. Can you meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a good price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm willing to compromise and pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87 is still below my minimum. I can offer you the product for $89.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87 and $89. Would you consider selling the product to me for $88? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,6,
