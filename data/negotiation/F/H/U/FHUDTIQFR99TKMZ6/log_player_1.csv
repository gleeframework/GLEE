Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. My asking price is $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a good compromise, leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows that you're willing to be flexible and get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really need to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is my minimum, but it's still a good deal since I can get $8,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  It's likely that if I reject and counteroffer, we'll end up in a stalemate, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $8,000 anyway.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision."
