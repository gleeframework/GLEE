Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still leaving room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
