"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is too high.  You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no need to accept an offer above that. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for further negotiation or can proceed with John."
