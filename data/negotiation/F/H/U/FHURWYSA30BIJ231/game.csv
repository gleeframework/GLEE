"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're set on $85, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference at $87.50? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",87.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85, but I'm not going any higher. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,6,
