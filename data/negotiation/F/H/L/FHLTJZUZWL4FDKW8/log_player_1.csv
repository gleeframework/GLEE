"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $11,750?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob is now closer to my acceptable range, and while I could push for a bit more, accepting $10,500 ensures a profit above my minimum. There's a risk Bob won't go higher, and I'd lose the deal by holding out for a potentially small gain."
