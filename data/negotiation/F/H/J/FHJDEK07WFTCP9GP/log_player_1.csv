Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, exceeding your minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob counter-offers) while still securing a significant profit above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob (""someone with your expertise"") creates a stronger incentive for him to accept."
