"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business operations. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $15,000 to me. However, considering its potential impact on your company, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. This represents a significant saving for you while ensuring that I receive a fair return for my investment. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John to maximize your savings."
