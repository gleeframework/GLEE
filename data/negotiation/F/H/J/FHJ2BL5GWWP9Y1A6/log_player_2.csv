{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $100. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $160? It's a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price that's still a good profit for me, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  With only three rounds left, the chances of Alice accepting a lower price are low. It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring he gets the best possible deal within his budget."
