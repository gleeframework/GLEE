I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.  This strategy balances maximizing my potential profit with minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
