"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This price gives you a significant advantage, and it's still a good deal for me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is above her valuation, it falls below your maximum price of $12,000 and is cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between acquiring the product and saving some money."
