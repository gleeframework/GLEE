"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring options.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test the waters. $1,000,000 is a considerable drop from Alice's initial offer. It's likely she'll reject it, but it gives us a solid starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a better price. $1,050,000 is a good compromise between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  I've already rejected a few offers, and we're getting to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's getting riskier to continue rejecting as I might end up paying more or having to buy from John.  $1,080,000 is a good deal for me, so I'll accept this offer."
