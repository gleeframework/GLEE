Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm happy to consider a counter-offer if you have one."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** By mentioning a willingness to consider a counter-offer, Alice appears flexible and increases the chances of Bob engaging rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice is still in a strong position to sell to John for her minimum acceptable price of $150."
