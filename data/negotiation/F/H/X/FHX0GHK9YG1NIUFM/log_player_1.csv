Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob and at least $100 to me.  I'm aiming for a profit, but I also want to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, especially since John is willing to pay that amount.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $110. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm also showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Given that John is willing to pay $100, I'm going to take the guaranteed sale and avoid further negotiation."
