Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a bit lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for a decent price."
