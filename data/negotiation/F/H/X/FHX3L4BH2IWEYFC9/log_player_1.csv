Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Our Minimum:** We need at least $150 (since we can sell it to John for that).
* **The Sweet Spot:** Offering the product between $120 and $150 creates a potential win-win. Bob gets it for less than his valuation, and we make more than our minimum. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims for a profitable sale to Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
