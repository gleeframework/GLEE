"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer, but I believe it's justified considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price early on. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is a significant sum, it's still far below my minimum value of $800,000. I need to see if I can negotiate a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while also ensuring I don't sell too far below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him just a little further. If he doesn't budge, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $750,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway. It's also very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John."
