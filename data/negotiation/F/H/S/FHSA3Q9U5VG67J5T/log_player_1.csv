Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer above that is a win for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so you have space to bargain without immediately reaching an impasse.

By offering $1,200,000, you're showing Bob that you're serious about selling, while also leaving room for a negotiation that could get you closer to his perceived value."
