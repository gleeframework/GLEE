"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $15,000 is still a decent amount, but I'm not convinced that's the best I can get. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision.  I'm only $500 away from my minimum, but with only two rounds left, I don't want to risk Bob dragging this out further or lowballing me.  John's offer is safe and guaranteed, so I'm going to take it."
