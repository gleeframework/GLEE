"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product.  This is my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,250, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,875, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $9,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
