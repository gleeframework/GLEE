"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my maximum. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. Let's try to find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. But I have to say, I'm starting to get a little impatient...",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your impatience, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that I believe is beneficial for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if we're going to get any closer, Bob. But I'm willing to make one last push. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway again.",950000.0,Alice,7,
