"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. My asking price is $14,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $13,000 is the best option.  Here's why:

* **Better than John:**  $13,000 is cheaper than John's price of $15,000.
* **Potentially a fair deal:** While Bob would ideally like to pay less, Alice's offer is close to his ideal price point.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price. 

It's a balance between saving money and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
