"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think it's worth $90 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for that amount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum value of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $87.50. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is within my budget and is a good deal, considering it's still lower than my maximum value of $100.  It's also a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or Alice getting frustrated and walking away."
