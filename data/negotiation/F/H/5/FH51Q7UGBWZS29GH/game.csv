"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and welcome your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's value significantly exceeds $700,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still pushing my limit.  I could go up to $750,000.  Do you think that would be workable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
