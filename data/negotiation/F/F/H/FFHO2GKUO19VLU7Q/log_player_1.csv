Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,500. How about we try to find a price that's closer to $9,000, but not as low as my initial offer? What if we meet at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,150. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we're nearing the end of the negotiation, I'm confident I can still achieve a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $9,500.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $9,750. It's a small compromise, and I think it's the best we can do to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9,750 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll propose $9,625. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm still a little away from my target price. However, with only two rounds left, the risk of Bob backing out or me losing out to John is too high. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $9,625."
