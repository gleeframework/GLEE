"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or see if she'll come back with a better deal."
