{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($120), but I'm also aware that Bob's maximum value is $80. By offering $110, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum value of $120. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell below my floor price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to see if we can find common ground. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still not able to meet at $100, but I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, $95 is still below my minimum value of $120.  I don't want to continue negotiating further and risk getting a worse offer. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
