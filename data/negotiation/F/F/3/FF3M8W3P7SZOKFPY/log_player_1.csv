"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price but still leaving room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000,  this offer is attractive while leaving some room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000 yet, especially with John as a backup option. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it still gets me closer to my goal of earning as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm getting close to my minimum. While $925,000 is tempting, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially losing out.  I'm going to take the sure thing with John and sell the product for $1,000,000."
