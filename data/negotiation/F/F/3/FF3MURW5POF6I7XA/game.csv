"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price that works for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,000? It's a fair price, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,875? That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9875.0,Bob,8,
