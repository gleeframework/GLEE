"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This gives Bob space to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being completely shut down. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not going to undervalue myself drastically. 

**Strategy:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he's hesitant, I'll be prepared to lower my price gradually, but I'll never go below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll also keep an eye on the number of rounds remaining. If we're close to the end and a deal isn't happening, I'll likely go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further with Bob. 
* **John's offer is an anchor:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which keeps my expectations high and ensures I won't settle for anything significantly below my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still willing to negotiate. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and be prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, but I won't go below $15,000.  If things stall or we're close to the end, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $11,000 is still a good price.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $15,000, but leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price. If he rejects it, I'll be prepared to lower my price again in the next round. However, I'll keep a close eye on the number of rounds and be ready to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is a decent improvement from his previous offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Significant gap remains:** There's a sizable gap between his offer and my desired price. 
* **Rounds remaining:**  We have 6 rounds left, which gives me time to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $11,000, possibly even $10,500, demonstrating flexibility while still holding my ground. I'll keep an eye on the remaining rounds. If we're close to the end and a deal seems unlikely, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Still above minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum price of $15,000, but it's getting closer to Bob's price point.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will get Bob closer to my desired price.  If he rejects it, I'll be prepared to lower my price again in the next round, but I'll keep a close eye on the number of rounds remaining. If we're close to the end and a deal seems unlikely, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $9,750 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me ($15,000).
* **We're nearing the end:** We have only 4 rounds left, so time is becoming a factor.
* **John's offer is tempting:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and the price is much closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000, possibly even $9,900, to see if we can reach a compromise. However, I'll be very aware of the remaining rounds. If Bob rejects this offer or if we reach the final round, I'm likely to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,000? It's a fair price, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (again):** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach a compromise.
* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I'm acknowledging his persistence and recognizing that he's holding firm to his price.
* **Still close to my minimum:**  My offer is still slightly above my minimum price, but it's getting closer to a potentially acceptable range.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this offer will persuade Bob to accept.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I need to decide whether I'm willing to risk further rounds with Bob or take John's guaranteed offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $9,875? That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on John's offer:**  We're down to the final two rounds.  Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, which indicates we're not making significant progress.
* **Time is running out:**  I've already made multiple concessions, and I'm not confident that Bob will move much higher.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is closer to my desired value and more than I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.

**Strategy:**

While it's tempting to keep negotiating with Bob, the risk of not closing a deal with him and losing out on John's offer is too high. It's time to secure the guaranteed value and move on."
