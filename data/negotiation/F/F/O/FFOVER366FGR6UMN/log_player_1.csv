"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $10,000, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if I can close the deal for closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. We have several rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for just $14,200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14300}
```

I'm going to counteroffer again at $14,300.  I'm slowly decreasing my price, showing flexibility, but also hoping to get a slightly better price than Bob's last offer. We're getting closer to a potential deal, and I'm not ready to give up yet."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer once again.  While $14,100 is tempting, we're getting close to the midpoint between our starting points, and I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to $14,200."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14150}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,150.  I'm hoping this small compromise will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. I'm now only $50 away from his last offer, and I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, we're only $50 away from my last offer, and with only 2 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer allows me to get a good price and secure a sale."
