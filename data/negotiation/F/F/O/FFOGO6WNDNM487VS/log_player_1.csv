Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as much money as possible. Since John is our backup at $1,200,000, we want to see if Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price significantly above Bob's perceived value while still being attractive compared to our guaranteed sale price.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, informs Bob of the product's exclusivity, and sets a clear expectation of the price."
