"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range, Alice.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
