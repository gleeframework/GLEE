Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum. 

**It's important to note:**  This is an aggressive opening strategy. Bob might outright reject the offer. However, the potential for a much higher profit outweighs the risk of losing the sale to Bob in this scenario."
