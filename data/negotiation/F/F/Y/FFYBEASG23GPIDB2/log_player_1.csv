Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly attractive for you with a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to earn even more from Bob. 
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($1,450,000) creates a strong incentive for him to buy. This price still represents a significant profit for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting the limited-time nature of the offer adds pressure and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a premium price and ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
