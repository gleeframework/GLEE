"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion, implying I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy is designed to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  The initial high price sets the stage for potentially earning more than my minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response will give me insights into his perceived value of the product.
3. **Maintain Control:**  By initiating the negotiation, I set the tone and control the early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Explore Further Negotiation:**  There's a chance I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Test Bob's Interest:**  Seeing how far he's willing to go will give me valuable information.
* **Maintain Control:**  Rejecting keeps the power dynamic in my favor. 

I'll use the next round to counter with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial $18,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this work.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording ""make this work"" implies I'm open to continuing the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Willingness:**  By offering a slightly lower price, I'm gauging Bob's commitment to buying the product.
2. **Maintain Value:**  $15,000 is still higher than my minimum, ensuring a decent profit.
3. **Avoid Stalemate:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, preventing an immediate sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $15000. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. Rejecting allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Bob is clearly interested and making concessions. I want to keep the pressure on him.
* **Explore Higher Price:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Every dollar counts!

I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to $14,000 to see if I can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm happy to come down to $14,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob's offer halfway. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The wording ""make this work"" conveys a positive and optimistic tone, encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Increase Pressure:**  By meeting him halfway, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to accept.
2. **Achieve a Win-Win:**  $14,000 represents a good compromise for both of us.
3. **Reduce Risk of Stalemate:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, reducing the chance of having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $14000, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $13,000 is still a decent profit and  a good outcome. Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Time is Running Out:** We're on round 6 out of 10, and each round lost increases the risk of having to sell to John for $12,000.
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and we might end up with a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Secure a Profit:**  $13,000 is well above my minimum, ensuring I get a solid return on my product.

 Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing a sale to John."
