Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $11,000 leaves room for negotiation without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll assess Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer, if it's acceptable, or make a new counteroffer to close the deal closer to my ideal price.
* If the negotiations stall, I'll have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
