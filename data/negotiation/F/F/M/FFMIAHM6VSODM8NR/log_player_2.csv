"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
