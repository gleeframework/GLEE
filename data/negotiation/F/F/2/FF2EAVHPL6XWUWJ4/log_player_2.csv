You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $70, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm thinking of a price of $85, which is a fair compromise between our last offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd consider, it's still not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John.  It's better to take the sure thing and avoid potentially overpaying."
