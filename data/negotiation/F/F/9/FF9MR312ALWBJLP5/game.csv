"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,100,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still more than your minimum and significantly less than what I'd pay John.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,220,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
