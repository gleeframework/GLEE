"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. Considering my budget constraints and the fact that I am looking for the best deal possible, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the true value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price still offers you a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
