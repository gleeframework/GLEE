The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You're only willing to pay $120, and Alice is at $140. There's still room for a compromise."

While you can continue negotiating, Alice has come down to $130, which is only $10 more than your maximum. It's unlikely you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  It's worth accepting the offer to avoid the risk of ending up paying John $120."
