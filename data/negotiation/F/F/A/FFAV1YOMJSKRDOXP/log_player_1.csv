Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is too low for me. I could meet you halfway from our previous prices. How about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers very slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $150 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
