"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. It's a fair price that's closer to my ideal price point and still within your budget range.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so how about $996,250?",996250.0,Bob,6,
