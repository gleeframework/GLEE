"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's, but you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $10,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and leaves room for potential negotiation.  Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to her, this price is still profitable for her.  This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer and gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget."
