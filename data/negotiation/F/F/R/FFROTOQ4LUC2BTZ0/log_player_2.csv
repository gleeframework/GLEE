"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  $90 is still too high for what you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the fair deal you're trying to make, but I'm not sure $90 is quite right for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $87.50. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get it for less, $87.50 is a good compromise. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and it's closer to my target price.  It's also significantly cheaper than buying from John."
