Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a fair price for Bob (he gets a $10 discount from his valuation) and it gives you a decent profit ($20 above your minimum).  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a fair enough price for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $128 is a decent profit and still significantly better than selling to John. It's time to close the deal and move on."
