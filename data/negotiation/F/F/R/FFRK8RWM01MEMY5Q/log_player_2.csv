"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if Alice will lower the price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price from Alice. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's the best option for Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget."
