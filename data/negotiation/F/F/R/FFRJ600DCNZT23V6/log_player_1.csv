{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $10,500? This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
