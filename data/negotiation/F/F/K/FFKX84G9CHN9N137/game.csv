"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, but $14,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000.  That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",13500.0,Alice,5,
