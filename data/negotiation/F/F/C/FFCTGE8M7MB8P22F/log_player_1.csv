Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language (""great deal"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate,  making Bob more likely to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiations stall or Bob makes an unacceptable counteroffer, I will stop the negotiation and sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum selling price of $150. Accepting this offer would be a loss. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** While I don't want to sell for $120, Bob's interest suggests there's room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll likely offer a price somewhere between $120 and $150 to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. How does that sound? "", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, moving closer to his offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Maintain positivity:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Open for final agreement:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to reaching an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll finalize the sale.
* If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or make a final counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is significantly below my minimum selling price of $150. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiations are stalling:**  Bob has shown a pattern of offering prices that are too low for me. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to my target.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, ensuring that I don't lose money on this deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product to him for $150."
