"Alice,  your initial offer is a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,300,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
