Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still securing a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum price. 

This strategy aims to balance profitability with the chance of securing a sale with Bob."
