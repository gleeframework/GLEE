"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 100 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking 90 is a fair price. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
