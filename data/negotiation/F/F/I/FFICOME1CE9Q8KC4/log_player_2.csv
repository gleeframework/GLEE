Alice's offer is far too high. It's better to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."

$14,000 is still too high. I'm going to try to get closer to my limit with another counteroffer."

While $13,500 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  It's worth it to go with John's offer and save the extra $5,500."
