You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You are willing to pay up to $150, so Alice's offer is too high. You should reject and counteroffer."

You are still trying to save as much money as possible, and $140 is still higher than your desired price.  Reject and try to negotiate further."
