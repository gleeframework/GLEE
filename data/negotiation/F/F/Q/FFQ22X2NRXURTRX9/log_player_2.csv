"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than Alice's initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."
