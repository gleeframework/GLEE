Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you with room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It allows you to gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects, you can either make a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about $850,000? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your valuation, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I've carefully considered our previous discussions, and I'd like to propose $860,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of him walking away, and I'm confident I can make up the difference with another buyer.  $860,000 is a good deal for both of us."
