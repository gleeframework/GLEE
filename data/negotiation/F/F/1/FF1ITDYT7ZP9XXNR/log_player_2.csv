"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject the offer. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, so paying $750,000 to Alice would be a significant saving.
