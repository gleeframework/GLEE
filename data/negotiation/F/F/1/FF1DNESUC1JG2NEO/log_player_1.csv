"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob is interested enough to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he isn't willing to meet me at least halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm dropping the price from my initial offer, but I'm still firm on getting at least $12,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can squeeze a little more out of Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. This is my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations. John's offer is guaranteed, and it meets my minimum requirement."
