Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60.

You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $120.  You have a guaranteed offer from John, and it's better to take the sure thing than risk Bob walking away."
