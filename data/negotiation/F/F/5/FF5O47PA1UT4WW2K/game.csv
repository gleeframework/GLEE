"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point. However, $9800 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $10200. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to meet my minimum threshold. Let's settle this deal and move forward.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9500.0,Bob,6,
