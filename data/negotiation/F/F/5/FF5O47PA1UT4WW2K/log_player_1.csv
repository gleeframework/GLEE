Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with further negotiation, considering the value the product holds for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point. However, $9,800 is still a bit below what I can accept. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $10,200. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to meet my minimum threshold. Let's settle this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10200 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum threshold.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
