"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $90. It's a steal at this price, and I know you'll love it! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $65 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $80, especially since I have several rounds left and John is willing to pay $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  However, $65 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $75 is my absolute bottom line.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $70 is closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $80 with more rounds left and John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $72?  This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 72}
