"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $90. It's a steal at this price, and I know you'll love it! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  However, $65 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $75 is my absolute bottom line.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still not at my ideal price point. It's worth seeing if she'll budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a compromise that brings us closer to the middle ground between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $70 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about we settle on $72?  This gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I could potentially push for a dollar or two less, getting the product for $72 is a good deal and saves me $8 compared to John's price. It's not worth the risk of her increasing the price or the time investment of further negotiation."
