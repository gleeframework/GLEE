"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer while still being a profitable deal for Alice. This counteroffer tests the waters and gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000. Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price and avoids further rounds of negotiation. There is a chance Alice might lower the price further, but the risk of her rejecting future offers and reaching the 10th round (potentially forcing Bob to buy from John) outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
