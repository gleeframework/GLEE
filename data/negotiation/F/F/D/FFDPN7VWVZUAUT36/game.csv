"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to earn a decent profit. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
