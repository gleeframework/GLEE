"Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your product has value, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John.",10500.0,Bob,4,
