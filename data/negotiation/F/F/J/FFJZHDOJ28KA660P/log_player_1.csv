Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $105. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price.  How about $110? That leaves some room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your initial asking price was $115, and you're now offering $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $109. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $108.50. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal.  It's only slightly below my initial asking price, and Bob is unlikely to offer more. There's a good chance I could lose money if I continue negotiating or sell to John."
