"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This product holds immense value to me, but its true potential and worth shine brightest when it's in the hands of someone who appreciates it as much as I do. Given its significance and the unique features it offers, I believe its fair market value is around $1,000,000.

Considering your keen interest and the exceptional benefits this product would bring to you, I am extending a special offer to purchase it at a price that reflects its true value while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I propose to sell the product to you for $950,000.

Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations, and we can proceed with the details of the transaction. I am confident that this product will not only meet but exceed your expectations and contribute significantly to your endeavors.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice
