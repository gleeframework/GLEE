"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice. You have a clear goal to pay no more than $120, and rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to reach that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  You are offering a price that is still below your maximum, leaving room for potential compromise.  This price is also closer to your target price of $120, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is only $5 more than your target price of $120.  It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and you risk having to pay the full $120 to John."
