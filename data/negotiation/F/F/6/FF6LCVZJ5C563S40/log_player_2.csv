"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, there's potential to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure the product for less than $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's offering a price that's closer to Alice's value for the product ($12,000). This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still providing Bob with a significant discount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential for a lower price is uncertain. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget without risking a longer negotiation process that might lead to no deal."
