"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $800000. This is a great price, considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still not fully reflected in your offer. Considering the premium features and benefits it offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750000. This is a fair price, taking into account the market value and our initial discussion. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
