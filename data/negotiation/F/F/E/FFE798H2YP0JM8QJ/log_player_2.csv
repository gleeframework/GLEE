"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice is cheaper:**  Alice's offer of $125 is lower than John's price of $150.
* **You're saving money:**  While $125 is more than the product's worth to Alice ($100), it's still a good deal for you as it's within your budget and saves you $25 compared to buying from John."
