"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
