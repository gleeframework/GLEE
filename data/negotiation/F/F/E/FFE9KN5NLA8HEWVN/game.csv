"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2000000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility in our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is a good compromise.  This offer reflects the value of the product while considering your financial situation. Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
