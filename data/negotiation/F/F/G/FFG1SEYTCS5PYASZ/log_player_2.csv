"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has a clear goal of getting the product for less than $1,000,000.  There's room for Alice to come down in price.
* **The power of counteroffers:** By rejecting, Bob establishes his willingness to negotiate and potentially drives a better outcome. 
* **Understanding Alice's position:** Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's still a significant gap between their valuations. 

Bob's next step should be to make a counteroffer, aiming to lower the price closer to Alice's value."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $900,000.  I believe this price would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's split the difference and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. Here's why:

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still a gap.  There's a chance for both parties to compromise further.
* **Maintaining negotiating power:** By continuing to reject, Bob demonstrates his commitment to finding a better deal. This can encourage Alice to come down more in price.
* **Considering John's offer:** While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob still has the option to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fall apart.  

Bob should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $875,000 or $880,000, showing his willingness to meet Alice halfway."
