"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget concerns.  While $1800000 is closer, I need to remain above my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
