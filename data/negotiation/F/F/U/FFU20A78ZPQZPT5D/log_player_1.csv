"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** A $12,000 offer gives me room to negotiate down if necessary without going below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm starting the negotiation with a friendly and optimistic tone, hoping to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **There are 9 rounds remaining.**  This gives me ample time to explore further negotiations and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. 
* **I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.**  This means I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to reach a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go.  This still gives you a good deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Remaining Firm:**  The counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, making it clear I'm not willing to settle for a drastic drop in price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer more seriously.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly suggesting the need for compromise, setting the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer is closer to my desired value and represents a significant compromise from his initial offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  While I'd prefer to push for a slightly higher price, the remaining rounds are limited. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, reducing the risk of failing to close the deal with Bob or needing to sell to John. 

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and conclude the negotiation.  This outcome provides a reasonable profit and minimizes the potential for further negotiation."
