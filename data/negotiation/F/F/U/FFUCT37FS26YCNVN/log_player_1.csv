Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my initial offer, given that Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is now closer to my desired price point, and while I'd prefer a higher price, it's a significant improvement over his initial offer.  I'm going to accept this offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
