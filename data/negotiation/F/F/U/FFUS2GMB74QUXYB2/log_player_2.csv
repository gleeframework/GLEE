"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to a potential lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that both he and Alice can agree on.  A counteroffer of $130 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a price too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is now within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, leaving him with no product and potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
