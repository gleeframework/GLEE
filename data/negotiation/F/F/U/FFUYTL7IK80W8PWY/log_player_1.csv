"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also a good starting point to see how interested Bob is in the product and how much he values it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is better than $15,000, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $19,000.  This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above Bob's offer and closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $17,500 is tempting, we're getting closer to my floor price. I still have time to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}

I'm counteroffering with $18,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my last offer and Bob's.  I'm trying to show flexibility while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500.  We're getting very close to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. With only three rounds left, it's time to push for a deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I have two rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

With only one round left, I'm counteroffering at $17,000.  This is a compromise and likely my final offer before I consider selling to John."

Round 10

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. While $16,500 is better than $15,000, it's still below my desired price and I've reached the final round.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  It's a bit disappointing, but it's the best I can do with Bob at this point."
