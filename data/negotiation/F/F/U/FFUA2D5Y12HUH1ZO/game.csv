"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $760,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,
