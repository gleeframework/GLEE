"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15000 to both of us. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000, which is what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $15000 is simply too low for me to let this product go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This would still allow me to recoup a good portion of the product's value while ensuring we can both be happy with the deal.  What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $16000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
