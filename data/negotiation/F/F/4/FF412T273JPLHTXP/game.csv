"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is a price we can agree on.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and still allows for a good profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and still allows for a good profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",925000.0,Alice,5,
