"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",980000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $980,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $960,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price around there.",960000.0,Bob,4,
