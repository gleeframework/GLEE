While I would like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is relatively close to my floor price. Also, he expressed a strong interest and willingness to commit.  This suggests further negotiation might be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice in this situation."
