"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship but also clearly states my budget limitations.

This counter-offer tests the waters and gauges how flexible Alice might be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $17,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and your alternative option with John.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic, trying to pressure you into accepting. However, you still have leverage since you can buy from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice decreased her price, there's likely still room for negotiation. You'll counter-offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is just not feasible for me right now.  I can do $11,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Offer, But Setting a Limit:**  You're showing willingness to compromise by increasing your offer substantially, but you're also setting a firm limit close to your maximum.
* **Introducing Scarcity (John):** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly remind Alice that you have an alternative and aren't desperate to buy from her at any price.
* **""Final Offer"" Counter:** By mirroring Alice's ""final offer"" language, you're signaling that this is a serious offer and you're unlikely to move much further. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between showing flexibility and maintaining a strong negotiating position."
