"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is just not feasible for me right now.  I can do $11,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
