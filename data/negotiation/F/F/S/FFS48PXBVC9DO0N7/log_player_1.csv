Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure if $1,600,000 is a fair price considering the market value I've researched. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value while being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
