"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure if $1,600,000 is a fair price considering the market value I've researched. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value while being within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above the price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
