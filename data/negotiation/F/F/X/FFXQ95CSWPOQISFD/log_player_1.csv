Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he negotiates.
* **Justification:** The message lightly implies the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will indicate his interest level and potential for negotiation. If he outright rejects the offer, you can always lower the price or move on to John. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for a successful sale to Bob."
