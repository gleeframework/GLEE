Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially offering it to you for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how he might negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have a guaranteed offer from John, so I'm not pressured to accept any lowball offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** While his offer is low, the fact he countered means he's interested. 
* **Below Minimum:** $9,500 is under my $10,000 floor. Accepting would be a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a gap between our prices, suggesting space to find a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $9,500 is below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?"", 
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've come down from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price ensures I make a profit and stay significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **Middle Ground:** Aiming for roughly the midpoint between our previous offers encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,800 is now above my $10,000 minimum, securing a profit.
* **Strong Offer:** While I could push for a bit more, $800 above my minimum is a good deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or offering a lower price.  It's better to accept a good offer now."
