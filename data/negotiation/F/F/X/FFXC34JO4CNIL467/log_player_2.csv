You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice is offering $11,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as it's clear she won't go lower than $11,000."
