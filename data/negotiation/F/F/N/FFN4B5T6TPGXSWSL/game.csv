"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $11500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11500.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, my revised offer is $11000 for the product and the service. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
