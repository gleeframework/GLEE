"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this within your budget? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate reason to accept.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $1100000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is closer to my budget, but still above what I'm willing to pay right now. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $1,000,000? That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $1,000,000,  $1,050,000 is a good price that saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
