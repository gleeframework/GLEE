"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this within your budget?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $1100000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. How about $1000000? That would be a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
