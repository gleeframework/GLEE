Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500, which is close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum desired price of $8,000.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's counteroffer is too low. While it's above my minimum desired price of $8,000, it's still significantly below my starting offer of $9,500. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  This allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my initial target. 
* **Plan B:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This is still a good price for me, as it's significantly higher than John's offer and leaves a considerable margin.
* **Testing the Waters:** By lowering the price slightly, I'm seeing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I will reconsider selling to John as it seems Bob is not willing to pay my desired price. 
* **Finality:** If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll likely consider accepting John's offer to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** While Bob's offer is still slightly below my initial target, it's now within a reasonable range of my minimum price of $8,000. It's not worth risking a further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my expectations.
* **Time and Energy:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but it could also lead to a stalemate or a rejection, forcing me to accept John's offer.  The potential gain from a higher price doesn't outweigh the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Security:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit, securing a good financial outcome.

By accepting this offer, I am prioritizing a guaranteed sale over the possibility of a slightly higher price, recognizing that the cost of continued negotiations could ultimately outweigh the benefits."
