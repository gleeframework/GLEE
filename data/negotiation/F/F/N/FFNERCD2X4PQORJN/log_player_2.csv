# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While you could try to haggle with Alice, accepting her offer of $14,000 is the most logical choice here. Here's why:

* **Saving money:** You save $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to get Alice lower might backfire, leading you to lose the product or having to settle for John's higher price. 

Accepting the $14,000 offer guarantees you get the product at a price well below your maximum budget."
