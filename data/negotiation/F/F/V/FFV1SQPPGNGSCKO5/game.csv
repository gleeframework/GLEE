"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little high for me. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the product.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $108 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
