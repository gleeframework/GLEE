"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $850000 doesn't quite cover my investment in this product. To bridge the gap, I'd like to propose a price of $875000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still working within a strict budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $860000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",860000.0,Bob,4,
