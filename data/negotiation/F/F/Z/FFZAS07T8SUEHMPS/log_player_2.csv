"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and acknowledge Alice's offer.** 
* **Express continued interest in the product.**
* **Offer a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point.**  This leaves room for further negotiation, but also makes it clear I'm aiming for a price closer to my $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to my range, but I'm going to try one more time to see if she'll go even lower.  It's worth the risk of her refusing before I resort to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I can go a bit higher. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Compromise:**  I'm signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to her price. 
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This framing can be persuasive, even though it's not exactly the midpoint. 
* **My maximum:**  This counteroffer is my absolute limit, so Alice knows I'm serious."
