"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's value to Alice. This should make my offer attractive to Alice while giving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still higher than my desired price. I have 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still too high. I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith while still keeping me within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is higher than John's price of $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. It's likely that Alice won't come down to my desired price and I have only 5 rounds left."
