"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but below my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message creates a more agreeable atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting that the deal is good for both of us can encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time and Rounds:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, so I can afford to keep negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still showing flexibility to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,350,000? That's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives you some room to work with. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging continued negotiation.
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that my offer is fair.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer, I'm still aiming for $1300000.  This is a fair price that still leaves us both with a decent profit. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still slightly below what I'm aiming for.
* **Room for a counteroffer:** I can still counter with a higher price, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintaining my value proposition.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 6 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiations without a major risk of reaching the deadline. 

**Next Step:** I will counter with a price slightly lower than my desired price, aiming for a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're very close to a deal. Let's split the difference. How about $1,325,000? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this today. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows a genuine desire to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on closing:**  The message emphasizes that we're close to a deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Positive and confident tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and confident, hoping to build trust and encourage a quick agreement. 
* **Time factor:**  While I have 5 rounds remaining, I want to push for a deal sooner rather than later to avoid potential risks of further negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm very close to accepting your offer, but I'm still hoping to get the price down to $1300000.  This is a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal.  I believe we can come to an agreement at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Only a slight difference:** The difference between my last offer and Bob's is only $25,000, which is a small amount in this situation.
* **More negotiation time:** I have 4 rounds remaining, which means I have time to potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee me my desired price, I still want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob, considering his willingness to negotiate.

**Next Step:** I will counter with a price slightly above $1,300,000, aiming for a compromise and a final deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The message highlights the readiness to ""close this right now,"" adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really close to accepting, but I'm still hoping to get the price down to $1300000. I believe we can make this deal work at this price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds remaining:** There are only two rounds left, and Bob is still insistent on $1,300,000.  
* **Minimum acceptable price:** While $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  
* **Opportunity cost:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal with John. 

**Selling to John is the best option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. It's safer and faster than continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially with limited time left."
