"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* $100 is still too high for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's desired price ($80) but still within my budget ($120). 
* This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also not willing to overpay. 
* This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a price that's too low for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $95, which is within my budget of $120 and significantly lower than John's price of $120.
* While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting this offer allows me to save money and secure the product without risking a worse outcome."
