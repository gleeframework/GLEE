I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to drop that low.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
