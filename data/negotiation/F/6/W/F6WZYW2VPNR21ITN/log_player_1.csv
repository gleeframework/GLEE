Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly profitable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob justifies the high price and aims to make it more appealing.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message encourages a response from Bob, giving you the opportunity to negotiate or gauge his interest level.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's potential walk-away point."
