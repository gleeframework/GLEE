,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1750000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $1400000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final compromise. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still higher than I can go.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1400000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
