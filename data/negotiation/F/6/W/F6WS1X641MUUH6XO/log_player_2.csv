# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still too high for Bob. He can get the product from John for $800,000.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000.  This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than what Bob can get the product for from John ($800,000).  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as it's clear she won't go lower.  Bob should buy the product from John to get the best price."
