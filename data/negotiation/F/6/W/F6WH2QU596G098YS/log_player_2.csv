"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. Is this a price you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You've already saved $100,000 by rejecting her first offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Is this a price that works for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price, saving $150,000 from the initial offer and $50,000 from John's price.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this scenario."
