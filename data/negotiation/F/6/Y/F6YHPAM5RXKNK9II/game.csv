"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $95. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $85, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $90, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",90.0,Alice,5,
