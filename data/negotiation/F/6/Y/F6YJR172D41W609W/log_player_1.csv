Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You aim for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your initial offer is $115, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down, and you can still settle for a price above your minimum.
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $120) might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for John's $100 offer."
