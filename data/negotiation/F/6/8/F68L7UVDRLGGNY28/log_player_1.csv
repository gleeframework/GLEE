``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm trying to get as much as possible, but I also want to avoid losing the deal to John. I'm offering a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than what he initially offered, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe there is room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but still a significant distance from what I'm willing to accept.  I don't want to continue the negotiation any further, as the chances of getting a better deal with Bob are slim.  It's time to move on to the sure thing and sell to John."
