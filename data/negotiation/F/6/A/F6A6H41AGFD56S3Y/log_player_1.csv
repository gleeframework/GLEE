Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price ($145) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this initial offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
