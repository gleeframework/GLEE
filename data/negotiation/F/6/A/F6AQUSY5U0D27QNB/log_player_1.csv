{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000) but still below the perceived value for Bob ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000, which would be $13,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair compromise. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you can accept this offer, I'll take the product. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal than to continue negotiating and potentially end up selling to John for my minimum price."
