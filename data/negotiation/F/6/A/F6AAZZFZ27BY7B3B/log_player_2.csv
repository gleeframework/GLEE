"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for a special price of $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than its value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John is willing to sell it for. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
