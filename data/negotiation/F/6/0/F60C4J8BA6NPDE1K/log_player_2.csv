"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and Alice is likely motivated to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A counteroffer of $750,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:** While this is a big drop, it's still above Alice's value for the product, allowing for potential compromise in future rounds. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility and how serious she is about selling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
