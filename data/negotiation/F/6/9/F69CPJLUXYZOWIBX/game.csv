"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget considerations, the value this product offers is substantial. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work, I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
