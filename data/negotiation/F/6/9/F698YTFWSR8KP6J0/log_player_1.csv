Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it feel more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I want to maximize profit, I'm not starting at $150. This leaves me space to negotiate down without going below my ""John"" price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer wasn't a lowball, suggesting he's genuinely interested and willing to pay a decent price. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price. 
* **New Anchor:**  Offering $120 establishes a new reference point for the negotiation, potentially encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $120 still ensures a healthy profit margin above my ""John"" price."
