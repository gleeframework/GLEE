Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for a price higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering it at $12,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
