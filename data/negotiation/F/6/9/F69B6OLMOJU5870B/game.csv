"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,550,000. This is a slight premium, but I believe the value it brings to your business will justify it. Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
