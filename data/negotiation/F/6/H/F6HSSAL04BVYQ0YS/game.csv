"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the unique benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too far below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects some flexibility on my end while acknowledging the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet halfway and offer $1,550,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
