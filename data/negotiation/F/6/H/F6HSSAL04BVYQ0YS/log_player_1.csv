Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
