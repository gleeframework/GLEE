"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a round number that might be more appealing to Bob. I'm hoping this price will gauge his interest and potentially lead to a quick negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to sell for that low in the second round. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering $1,350,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I'm still holding out for more. I'm not ready to accept just yet and I have several more rounds to try and secure a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This further demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but it's still a decent profit for me.  I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a higher price. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a profitable deal."
