"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it's priced fairly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I maximize my potential profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price point before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Would $1,050,000 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm only $50,000 away from my minimum goal, and John is a guaranteed $1,000,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $1,060,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best I can do with Bob. It's a bit below my minimum, but I'm only $10,000 short.  It's a better outcome than selling to John."
