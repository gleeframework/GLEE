"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Being Friendly:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for counteroffers and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Potential to close the deal:** There are still rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still have a firm price in mind.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value of the product and suggesting it's worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $85.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential to close the deal:**  I can still make a counteroffer. Even though it's getting late in the negotiations, I might be able to nudge him up a bit.
* **John is an option:**  It's good to know that I have a guaranteed sale with John, but I'm not giving up on Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I'm really at my limit with that price. I'm willing to go down to $90, but I can't go any lower.  This is a great deal for you, so let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final offer. I'm taking a small step towards Bob's price, but I'm emphasizing that it's my best offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal. This could make Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a great deal at $90.

**Why not go with John?**

While John is a guaranteed $100, I'm still trying to maximize my profit with Bob.  $90 is closer to my ideal outcome, and there are still rounds left to try and push Bob higher."
