"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $85.  Let's make a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I'm really at my limit with that price. I'm willing to go down to $90, but I can't go any lower.  This is a great deal for you, so let's close this out.",90.0,Alice,5,
