"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $12500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13250. That's the lowest I can go.",13250.0,Bob,4,
