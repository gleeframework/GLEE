"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point while also acknowledging that he might be interested in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13250. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $13,250 is within a reasonable range and gets me closer to my minimum.  It's also a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value.  There's a risk of losing a sale by pushing further, so I'm going to accept his offer."
