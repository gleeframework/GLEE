"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the quality and benefits of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm thinking of $10,000. However, I can go a bit lower and offer $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
