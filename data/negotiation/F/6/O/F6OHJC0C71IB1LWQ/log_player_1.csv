"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a high starting price to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, allowing for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still a decent price:** It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but I believe there's room for improvement.
* **Opportunity to secure a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested, and rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** It's still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Encouraging a deal:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the deal:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $900,000, and only $50,000 less than my counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower offer from Bob, or he could walk away altogether.  
* **Time is running out:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to balance getting a good price with the risk of losing the sale.  

I'm confident that accepting Bob's offer will give me a good profit while securing the sale."
