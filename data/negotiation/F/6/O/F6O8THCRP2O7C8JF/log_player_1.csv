"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this initial offer allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good return for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price from the initial offer but still aiming for a profit that's significantly above my minimum. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter again in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate, but lowering my price again.  I'm aiming for a compromise and hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum requirement. It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While I might be able to push for a higher price, the potential for a failed negotiation and being forced to sell to John for the same amount makes accepting this offer the best choice."
