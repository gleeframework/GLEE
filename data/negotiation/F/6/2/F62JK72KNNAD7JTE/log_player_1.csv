"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Framing the Message:**  I'm focusing on the product's value and emphasizing a ""fair"" price, hoping to create a sense of potential value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and I believe I can get closer to that.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a strong fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product, and gives you a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, again appealing to Bob's sense of value.
* **Open Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Goal:**

I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward. This counteroffer is a calculated risk â€“ if Bob rejects it, I still have time to make further adjustments or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product given my budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer than his previous offer, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I believe I can still reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  John's offer provides me with a secure fallback option, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices.  I will focus on finding a price point that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  To show you I'm willing to meet you halfway, I'm offering the product for $10,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and gives us both a good deal. I believe this is a win-win situation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($9,000) and my last offer ($10,750). This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, reinforcing the idea that $10,000 is a fair price.
* **Win-Win Framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us, creating a sense of shared gain.

**Goal:**

With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's acceptable to Bob while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious about accepting an offer that doesn't meet my minimum needs.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, providing me with a strong safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I need to be strategic, as time is becoming a factor. I will consider John's offer seriously if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This price reflects a genuine compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Appeal to Time:**  I mention the time spent negotiating to emphasize that we're getting closer to a final decision.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** I stress that the price reflects a ""genuine compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Goal:**

I'm aiming to close the deal within the remaining rounds. This counteroffer is a calculated risk, as it's likely my last attempt to convince Bob. If he rejects it, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. Based on our previous discussions and the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this offer is acceptable and brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offers. While it's still below my ideal outcome, it's a significant improvement.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We only have two rounds left. If I reject this offer, there's a risk that I won't be able to negotiate a higher price in the remaining time.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $10,000 is less than John's offer of $15,000, accepting it still ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out on a sale entirely if I continue to negotiate and then lose Bob as a buyer.

**Next Steps:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and a reasonable profit. This decision balances the potential for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
