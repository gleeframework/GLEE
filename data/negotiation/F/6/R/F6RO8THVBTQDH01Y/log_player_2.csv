"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. After careful consideration and evaluation of its worth, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,200,000. This price reflects not only the intrinsic value of the item but also the potential it holds for you. I am confident that you will find its worth exceeds this investment many times over. I look forward to discussing this further with you and exploring how we can finalize this transaction. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money ($400,000) by going with John."
