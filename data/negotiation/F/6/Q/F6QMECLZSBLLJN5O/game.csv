"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet the price of $11500. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're willing to accept.",11000.0,Bob,4,
