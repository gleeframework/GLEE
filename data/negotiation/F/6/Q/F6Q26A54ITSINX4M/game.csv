"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. How about we meet at $9200?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $8900? This is my absolute maximum, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8900. I've already made concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Good luck with your search for the product!",0.0,Alice,7,
