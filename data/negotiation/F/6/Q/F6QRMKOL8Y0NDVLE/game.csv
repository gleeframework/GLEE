"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $15,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my work. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 just isn't enough for me to sell this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $14,500. I think we're getting close, but I still need to save as much as possible. How about $14,000? That's the absolute highest I'm willing to pay.",14000.0,Bob,6,
