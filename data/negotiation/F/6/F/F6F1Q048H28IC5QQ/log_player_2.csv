"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, I'm only willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, as it's below my maximum value and above your minimum. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's close to his target while still being above Alice's minimum value. Offering $10,500 shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm price point. This leaves room for some potential counteroffers while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum value.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm still confident this product will provide value, but I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm on his offer of $10,500. He's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but also showed that he's not willing to budge much further.  This keeps the pressure on Alice and shows that Bob is serious about getting a fair price."
