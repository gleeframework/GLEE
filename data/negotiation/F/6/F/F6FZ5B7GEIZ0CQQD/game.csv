"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you is around $100. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, ensuring a fair deal for both parties.",110.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can meet at this price.",105.0,Bob,2,
