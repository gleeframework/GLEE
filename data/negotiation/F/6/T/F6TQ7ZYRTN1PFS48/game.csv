"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential value in your product,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $750000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we split the difference at $875000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach a deal.  ",800000.0,Bob,4,
