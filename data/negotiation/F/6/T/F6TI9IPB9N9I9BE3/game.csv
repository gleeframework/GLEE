"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally get this deal done.",95.0,Alice,5,
