"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more and still have 8 rounds to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,700,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my lower limit,  I'm not yet at the point where it makes sense to sell to Bob, and still have more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  I am confident that Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm willing to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I've reached the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation with him. We're only four rounds away from the deadline, and it's unlikely he'll come up to my price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and saves time."
