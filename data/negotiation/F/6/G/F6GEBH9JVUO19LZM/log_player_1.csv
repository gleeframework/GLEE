"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
 
**Reasoning:**

Starting high allows room for negotiation.  We're aiming for a price that benefits both of us, and this offer is significantly less than Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good offer, we started high for a reason. There's still room for negotiation, and we're aiming to get closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

We're showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. $125 is still a good profit margin for us and a price Bob is likely to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than $125, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $122.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While we're aiming high, $122.50 is a solid profit and close to our desired price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations stalling or Bob walking away."
