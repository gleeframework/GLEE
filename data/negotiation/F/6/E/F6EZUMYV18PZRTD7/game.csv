"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product and the benefits it will bring to my business, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
