Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However,  $1,250,000 is still quite a way off from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a substantial compromise on my part. This offer is final. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated her current offer ($1,000,000) is final.  She's unlikely to move much closer to your $800,000 limit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price."
