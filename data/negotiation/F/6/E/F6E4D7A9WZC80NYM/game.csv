"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However,  $1,250,000 is still quite a way off from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a substantial compromise on my part. This offer is final. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
