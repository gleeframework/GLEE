{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $1,750,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I don't want to lose him completely, I'm going to try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However,  $1,250,000 is still quite a way off from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This reflects the maximum value I can justify for this purchase. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a substantial compromise on my part. This offer is final. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
