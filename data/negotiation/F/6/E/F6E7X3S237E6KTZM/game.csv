"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I believe $11,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to come down a bit more. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $500, which will give you extra assistance and priority service. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $10,500, including the support package.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200, which is still a great value considering the premium support package I'm including. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,7,
