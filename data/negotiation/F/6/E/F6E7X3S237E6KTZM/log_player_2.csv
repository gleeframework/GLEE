Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $500, which will give you extra assistance and priority service. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $10,500, including the support package. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $10,500, even with the added support package (which may or may not hold much value to you).  It's clear she's unlikely to budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are getting smaller. It's time to apply more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This offer is still above Alice's value, giving her room to profit.
* **Introducing scarcity:** By mentioning ""other options"" and a ""budget,"" you create a sense that the deal might fall through if Alice doesn't agree. This could push her to accept.
* **Close to your limit:** You're getting closer to your walk-away point ($12,000 from John). This keeps the pressure on Alice while minimizing your risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,200, which is still a great value considering the premium support package I'm including. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:**  You've managed to get the price down to $10,200, saving $1,800 from your initial limit and $1,000 from Alice's starting point.
* **Final offer:** Alice has indicated this is her best price.  Continuing to push might make her back out of the deal entirely.
* **Time constraint:**  You're running out of rounds, and there's a risk that continuing negotiations won't lead to a significantly better outcome.

It's best to accept the deal now and secure a good price rather than risking losing the deal altogether."
