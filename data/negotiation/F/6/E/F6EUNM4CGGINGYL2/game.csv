"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you consider a lower price closer to that?",4500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $4,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its original price to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $6,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
