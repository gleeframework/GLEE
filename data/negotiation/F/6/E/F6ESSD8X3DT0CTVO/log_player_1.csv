"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking for $145 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room to potentially adjust the price if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can get a higher price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still leaving some room to potentially come down further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. I'll stick with my original offer of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob hasn't budged much. I'm still hopeful that I can convince him to pay more. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for the quality of the product, and I think it's worth it for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'll still only consider $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where it seems Bob is not willing to budge further.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get the price I want. To avoid losing time and potentially get a better price, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
