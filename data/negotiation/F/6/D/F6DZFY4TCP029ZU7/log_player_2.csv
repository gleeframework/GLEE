"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. By rejecting, you open the door to potential negotiation and could potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for another round of bargaining, potentially bringing the price closer to your desired $120."
