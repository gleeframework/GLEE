Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I'm not going to sell it for less.
* **Potential gain:**  By asking for $1,500,000, I have the potential to earn an extra $300,000. 
* **Risk assessment:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. This means I'm taking a calculated risk in hopes of a larger profit.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
