"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI for someone like you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far beyond your budget of $800,000. It's essential to negotiate and try to get a more favorable price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, as I have another option available for that amount. Let me know if you're open to discussing this."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,550,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still well above my budget of $800,000.  While negotiating further is an option,  it's not guaranteed that Alice will come down further, and the risk of going over my budget is too high.  At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially responsible choice."
