Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, as I have another option available for that amount. Let me know if you're open to discussing this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,550,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}"
