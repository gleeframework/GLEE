"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating and seeing if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I do see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate further. There's still time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This would represent a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is stuck at $1,050,000. While this is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point.  You've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Given that you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the most sensible choice to take advantage of that offer.  This saves you $250,000 compared to buying from Alice."
