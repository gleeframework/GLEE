"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I do see the potential in this product, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's discuss this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $950000. This would represent a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can close the deal on this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
