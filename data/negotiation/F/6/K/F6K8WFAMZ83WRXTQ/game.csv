"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to accommodate your budget. However, given the cost and value of the product, I cannot lower the price below $110. This price reflects the quality and benefits the product offers. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",110.0,Alice,3,
