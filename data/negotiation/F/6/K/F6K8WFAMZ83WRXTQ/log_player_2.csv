"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for the item. This price reflects not only the cost but also the perceived value it holds for you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above your maximum budget of $100. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to accommodate your budget. However, given the cost and value of the product, I cannot lower the price below $110. This price reflects the quality and benefits the product offers. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll accept a lower price. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring I stay within my budget."
