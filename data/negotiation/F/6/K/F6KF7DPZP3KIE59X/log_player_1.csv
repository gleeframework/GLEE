"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer allows us to see how eager Bob is to buy. His response will give us valuable information for our next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  We are aware of John's standing offer ($800,000), providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than our starting offer and Bob's perceived value. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. We're confident we can bridge the gap without losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Justification:**  We re-emphasize the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying the price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We want to keep the negotiation moving and encourage Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow but Steady:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's still interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Maneuvering:** While $975,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we are still in early rounds and believe we can secure a better deal.
* **John as Backup:** We haven't forgotten John's offer, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall significantly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Psychological Threshold:** $1,000,000 represents a significant psychological price point. It's a round number that can feel more palatable to Bob while still being well above our minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting this is our final offer, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlighting Value:** We once again emphasize the product's value to justify the price and potentially sway Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $985,000. This price aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's offer increments are getting smaller.  Holding out for a significantly higher price is becoming less likely.
* **Strong Profit:**  $985,000 is a substantial profit, well above our minimum and John's offer.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
