Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum desired price ($150).  This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I hope to:

* **Gauge his interest:** If Bob accepts, I get a good price.
* **Initiate negotiation:** If Bob rejects, it gives him a reason to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** The threat of selling to John for $150 gives me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $100. Would you be able to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired price range, but still within his stated budget. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a $100 budget.  While I can't go as low as that, I'm willing to come down to $125. This would still give you a great deal on a product worth much more, and it's a fair price considering my cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $125, which is halfway between Bob's offer ($100) and my minimum price ($150). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraint but reiterate the value proposition of the product and highlight the fairness of my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our price expectations.
* **Showing Flexibility:** By meeting him halfway, I show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $125 is still significantly above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.

I'm optimistic that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
