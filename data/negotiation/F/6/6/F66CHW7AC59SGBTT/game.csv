"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think this is a fair deal and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to $7,000 as possible, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
