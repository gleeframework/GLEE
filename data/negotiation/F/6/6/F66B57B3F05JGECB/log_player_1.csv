Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{

}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer, which he has stated is his ""final offer.""  While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting too risky to lose the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
