"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly and open tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm showing flexibility to signal I'm willing to compromise. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a loss.  

I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round. This keeps the negotiation alive while still protecting my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,000? This is still a great deal for such a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a firm price:** I'm starting with a price that matches my minimum value, leaving little room for further concessions.
* **Reasoning and benefits:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Positive and open tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open communication style to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

This approach is designed to push Bob closer to my desired price point while remaining fair and potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept. There are a couple of reasons for this:

* **Time is of the essence:** I'm only four rounds in, and I have six more to go. There's a good chance I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 if I continue negotiating.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Even if I don't get to $12,000, there's still a chance I can get a better deal than $10,000 with further negotiation.

By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation going, leaving open the possibility of a more favorable outcome for myself."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to be sure I get a fair price for this unique product. How about $11,000? This is a significant concession on my end, and I'm confident it will be a great value for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise with a slight concession:**  I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a price that's within my desired range.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:** I'm reiterating the product's value and stressing the fairness of my offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive and solution-oriented language:** I'm using language that focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution, creating a more collaborative tone.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and potentially secure a deal that's favorable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now at round 6, and Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I've only got four rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal within that time frame. 

I've also been making concessions, and there's a risk that further negotiation will just result in a lower price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum value and provides a secure and predictable outcome."
