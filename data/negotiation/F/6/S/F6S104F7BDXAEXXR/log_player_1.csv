Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a strategic balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's why:

* **$1,150,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).** This means I'm still making a substantial profit.
* **$1,150,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).** This provides Bob with a clear incentive to accept, as he's getting the product for a price he considers fair.

By offering a price that leaves room for negotiation but also incentivizes Bob to accept, I increase my chances of getting the higher price while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
