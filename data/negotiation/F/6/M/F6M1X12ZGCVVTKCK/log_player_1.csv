"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My initial price is $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's potential. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm also aware of its immense worth, so I won't be accepting anything too far below that figure. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1500000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in acquiring this product, but I can't justify that price. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There are still rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still represent a significant benefit for you and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $975000. This represents a significant investment for me and would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000, it's still not quite there. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. It's just a small step up from your offer, but it would make a big difference for me.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a higher price, but $1025000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000, we are nearing the end of our rounds. I'm worried that I won't be able to reach a deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk selling the product for a lower price than what John is offering. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John."
