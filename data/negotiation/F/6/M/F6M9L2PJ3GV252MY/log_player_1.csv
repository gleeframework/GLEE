"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $115 leaves room for negotiation, but is still a good price for me. 
* **Positive tone:** A positive tone might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 I'd get from John.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 8 rounds left, I have time to see if I can improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a little low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer.
* **Still above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is a fair price for both of us, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That's a good price for both of us and would help us finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is offering a slightly higher price, $107.5 is still below my minimum of $120.
* **I'm close to John's offer:**  I'm only $2.5 away from getting $120 from John, and there's still a chance Bob will come up in price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John, but the potential reward of getting a higher price from Bob outweighs that risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $112.50. That's a significant concession, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** $112.5 is still above my minimum of $120, so it's a profitable deal for me.
* **Urgency and positivity:** The ""Let's make this deal happen!"" message adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it'll help us close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Close to John's offer:**  I'm only $0.50 away from getting $120 from John.
* **Risk of stalemate:** There's a chance Bob will continue to decline offers, and I might end up with a lower price than John's offer.

It's a tough decision, but selling to John guarantees a $120 profit, which is safer and more profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
