"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a little low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. That's a good price for both of us and would help us finalize the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $112.50. That's a significant concession, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it'll help us close this deal quickly.",109.5,Bob,6,
