Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** The price is lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while leaving room for a potential counteroffer. I want to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. By starting with a price higher than his perceived value, I'm hoping to get him to offer a price closer to my desired range."

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm raising the price by a very small amount ($50) to demonstrate my flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.

* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm keeping the negotiations moving while inching closer to my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a small increase, so Bob is likely to find it reasonable. This could push him towards accepting, but if he rejects, I still have time to negotiate further. This approach aims to close the gap while ensuring I don't give away too much."
