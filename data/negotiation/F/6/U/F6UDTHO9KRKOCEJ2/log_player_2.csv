"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much too high. You know you have a better alternative with John for a significantly lower price.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often involve starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significant Difference:** By offering $8,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but need a substantial price reduction. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $9,500?  That would really help me seal the deal."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Alice's move towards a compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Specific Number:**  Offering a specific number like $9,500 can feel more concrete and persuasive than just asking for a lower price again.
* **Urgency:**  By suggesting this price would ""help me seal the deal,"" I'm subtly implying I might consider John's offer if we can't agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $11,000 is her absolute lowest price. While it's a tempting offer, it's still $1,000 over your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000. At this point, it makes more financial sense to go with John's offer."
