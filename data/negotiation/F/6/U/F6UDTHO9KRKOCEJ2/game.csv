,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $9,500?  That would really help me seal the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
