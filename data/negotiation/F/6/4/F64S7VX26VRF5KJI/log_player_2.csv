Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $90. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's better to secure the product from John at $80 than to risk the negotiations failing."
