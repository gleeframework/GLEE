"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $100. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $100 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $90. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,5,
