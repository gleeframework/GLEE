{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and gives you a good margin for profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit potential.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to continue negotiating, I think $975,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant amount, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000.  Let's seal the deal!"
