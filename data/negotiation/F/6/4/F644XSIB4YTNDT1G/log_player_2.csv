"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and gives you a good margin for profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget of $1,500,000, and I can buy the product from John for that price.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This reflects my desire to save as much money as possible. I'm also trying to emphasize that I still see value in the product and am willing to pay a fair price.  I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit potential.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price, but it's getting closer. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better deal. I can still buy from John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. By offering $975,000, I'm showing that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to save as much as possible. I believe this price is a good compromise that benefits both of us."
