"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and gives you a good margin for profit.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit potential.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows for a good profit for both of us. Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Bob,4,
