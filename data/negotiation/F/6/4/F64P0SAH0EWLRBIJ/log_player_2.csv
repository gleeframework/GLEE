"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  There are 9 rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down to a point where it's a good deal for me, but still potentially acceptable to Alice.  I'm leaving room for negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,200 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally lowering my offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price.  At $6800, I'm still within a reasonable range, but I'm pushing the boundaries of what Alice might accept.  We'll see if she bites!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, I believe that continuing to negotiate may not yield a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal with enough time to potentially find a better option if something comes up."
