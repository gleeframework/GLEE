Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential upside:**  I'm aiming for a significant profit.  Offering $1,500,000 gives me a $500,000 profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward is high.  I'm willing to take that risk, as I can still sell to John for my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create a sense of urgency and make Bob think about the opportunity cost of missing out.  If he rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John."
