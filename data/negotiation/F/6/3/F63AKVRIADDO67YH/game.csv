"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this quality, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I can accept for a product of this quality.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
