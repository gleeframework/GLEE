"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and should try to get closer to his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. While $9,500 is a better offer than the previous round, it's still above Bob's target. He has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise. Considering your latest offer, I propose we set the product price at $9,200. This gives you a good deal while ensuring a satisfactory profit for me. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.
