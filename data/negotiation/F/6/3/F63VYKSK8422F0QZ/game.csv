"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,500,000. Given its value, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
