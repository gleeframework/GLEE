Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that my offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer. This ensures I'm maximizing my potential profit.

By starting at $11,500, I'm aiming for a win-win: Bob gets a product he values for a price slightly below that, and I make a significant profit above my minimum."
