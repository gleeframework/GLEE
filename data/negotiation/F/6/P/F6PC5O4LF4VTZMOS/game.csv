"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product looks promising, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my best and final counteroffer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good,  $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
