Bob's offer:

That's a significant discount from my original asking price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll do $10,500. That's as low as I can go.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and at this point, accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
