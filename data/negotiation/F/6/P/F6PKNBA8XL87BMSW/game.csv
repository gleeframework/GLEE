"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is too far below my minimum. I can go as low as $9,100.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9100.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,900. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Would you consider this?",8900.0,Bob,6,
