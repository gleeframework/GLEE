"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,000,000). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to recoup most of the product's value, while giving you a significant discount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your target price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
