Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, but still below my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'll take the safe option and sell to John."
