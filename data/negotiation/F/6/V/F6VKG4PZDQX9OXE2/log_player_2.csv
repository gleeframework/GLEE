Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000.

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to accept a price close to your $1,000,000 limit. She's already gone back on her ""lowest price"" statement. At this point, continuing the negotiation is risky, as she might not budge much further and you'll end up having to buy from John anyway at the highest price."
