"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it to the right buyer. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
