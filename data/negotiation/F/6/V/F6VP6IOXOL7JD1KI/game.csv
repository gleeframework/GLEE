"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  While $1,200,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This reflects the true value of what the product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,900,000 remains outside of my financial capacity.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
