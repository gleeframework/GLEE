"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $150, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm holding out for at least $120, and I'm not afraid to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $95 is not enough, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not afraid to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm coming down to $125, which is still a profit for me and likely within Bob's range.  I'm feeling confident that this is close enough to my target price to get him to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $120. I've made a few counteroffers, but Bob isn't budging on his price. It's becoming clear that we're too far apart to make a deal in the remaining time. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with."
