"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $950,000. I'm still not comfortable going that low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
