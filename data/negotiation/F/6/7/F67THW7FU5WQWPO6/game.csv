"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that the product should align more closely with my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $1,700,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on the budget. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly.  Let's settle at $1,850,000. This is my best and final offer.  It represents a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
