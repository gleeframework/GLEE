"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $1,150,000 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  We're aiming to get the price significantly lower, knowing Alice's value is $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

We're moving closer to Alice's valuation but still leaving some room for negotiation. This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while aiming for a price that benefits us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here. Let's close the gap â€“ I can do $1,050,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close!  Alice is still above her valuation, and we have time to push a little further.  Let's see if we can get her closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
```

This counter-offer puts us very close to Alice's valuation while still saving us a significant amount compared to John's price or Alice's earlier offers. By proposing a compromise, we increase the likelihood of a deal while maximizing our potential savings."
