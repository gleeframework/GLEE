"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still allowing you a decent return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $9,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your product, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $8,750? This is a fair price that allows for a good return for you and stays within my budget. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
