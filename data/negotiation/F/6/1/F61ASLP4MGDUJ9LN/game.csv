"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you as well. To start, I'm offering it for $150. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to propose a compromise at $125 for the product. This still reflects its value to me while being more accessible for your budget. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $112.50? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your suggestion, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we settle at $115? This offers a slight compromise that respects both our positions.",115.0,Alice,5,
