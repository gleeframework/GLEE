"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
