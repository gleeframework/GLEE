Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While $150 is your minimum, and $80 is Bob's value, aiming for a price around $115-$125 might be a win-win.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
