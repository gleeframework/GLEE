"Alice, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $800000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800000. It's my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
