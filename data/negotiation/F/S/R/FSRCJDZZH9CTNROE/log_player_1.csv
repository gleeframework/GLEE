I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I can sell to John for $8,000, I want to try to get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves room for you to make a profit given the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,000 is a good price and I'm happy to close the deal. It's better than selling to John for $8,000 and we're still within a few rounds of our negotiation goal."
