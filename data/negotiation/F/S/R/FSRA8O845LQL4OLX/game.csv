"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,650,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,620,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1620000.0,Bob,4,
