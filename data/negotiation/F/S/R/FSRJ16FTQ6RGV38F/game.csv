"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still pushing my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.",8000.0,Bob,6,
