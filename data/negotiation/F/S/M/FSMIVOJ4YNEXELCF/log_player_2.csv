"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is a good deal for Bob. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good time to accept the offer and close the deal."
