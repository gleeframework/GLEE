"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than what Bob initially valued the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering a price of $100. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept at this point. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95. This is a further compromise, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been pushing for a higher price, but it's getting late in the negotiation and Bob seems reluctant to go any higher. I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120. It's not the ideal price, but it's still a good profit and prevents me from risking going too low."
