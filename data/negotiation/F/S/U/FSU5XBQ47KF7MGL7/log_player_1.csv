Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice while still offering Bob a discount compared to its worth to him ($1,000,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential for increased profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
