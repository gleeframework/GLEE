"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal.  It's also possible Alice might counter with a lower price to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point that is still well above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still not ideal for Bob.  Rejecting the offer again gives Bob another chance to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Since buying from John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, continuing the negotiation with Alice is the best option at this point.  It might lead to a better price or, if not, John remains a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price.  $875,000 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying, but also that he's willing to walk away if necessary. This offer gives Alice a chance to accept and secure a profit, while still offering Bob a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently increasing her price, which means the negotiation is not moving in Bob's favor.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees the product acquisition within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of further price increases from Alice. It's time to secure the deal and avoid potentially losing out on a good opportunity."
