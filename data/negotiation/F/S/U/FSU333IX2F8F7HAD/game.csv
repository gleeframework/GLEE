"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your operations. I've assessed its worth to you at $1,500,000, and I'm confident it will be a significant asset. To make this a mutually beneficial transaction, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  This price allows me to meet my minimum requirements while offering you a substantial discount. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
