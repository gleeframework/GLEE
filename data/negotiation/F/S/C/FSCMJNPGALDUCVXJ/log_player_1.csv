"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. It's a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not willing to sell for my absolute minimum right away.  There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping to close the deal close to my initial asking price, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's interest with a lower counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than what I could get from John. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations. There's a chance Bob could lower his offer again in the next round, but I don't want to risk it."
