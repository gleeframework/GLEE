Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the deal's value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to discussion.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, potentially leaving space for a higher final price.
* **Avoid unnecessary delays:** By starting high, I'm trying to reach an agreement quickly before resorting to further negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a major loss for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's a chance I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **John is a reliable backup:** Even if the negotiations fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $10,500 is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, aiming to justify the price.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and mutual benefit. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase the price:** $11,500 is closer to my desired price point than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Maintain bargaining power:** By offering a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not ready to settle for Bob's first price, keeping the negotiation active.
* **Keep John as a fallback:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still rely on John to sell the product for $15,000."
