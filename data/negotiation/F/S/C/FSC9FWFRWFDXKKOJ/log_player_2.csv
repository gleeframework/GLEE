{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Explanation: 

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much below $104. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in significant savings. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John at $120 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further in the last round."
