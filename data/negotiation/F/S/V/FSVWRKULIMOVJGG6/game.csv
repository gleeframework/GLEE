"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While I understand $110 is your limit, I can't go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer you the product for $115. This price still leaves me room for profit while being fair to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer the product for $112, which is a fair compromise. It's only $4 more than your last offer, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to make this work.",112.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,6,
