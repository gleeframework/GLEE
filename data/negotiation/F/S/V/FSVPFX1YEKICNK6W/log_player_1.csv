Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for potential counteroffers:** It sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you can always go back to John and sell it for $15,000. But, by starting with a slightly lower price, you may be able to strike a deal with Bob that is still profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I can't go as low as $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
