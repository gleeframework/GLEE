"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $90 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $75 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price, as he still has rounds left and could potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $80 for this product.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $85. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. It's a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82.50 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He has already made his final offer of $80, and Alice has rejected it.  At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  Bob can get the product for his desired price from John, so it's best to move forward with that option."
