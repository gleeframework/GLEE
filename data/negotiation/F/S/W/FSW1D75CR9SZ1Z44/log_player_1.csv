Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Sale:** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. Offering $140 makes it very likely he'll accept, as it's still significantly below his perceived value.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I need to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to choose me instead."
