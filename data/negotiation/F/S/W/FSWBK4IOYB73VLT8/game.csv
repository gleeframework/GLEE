"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset that you know is worth $1,200,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity for you to get it at a slightly higher price.  Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual worth.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. It's a valuable product worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $1,150,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,075,000? It's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
