"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this compromise?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,400. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,400. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this compromise?",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye to eye on this price.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but this is it: $10,350. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  If you're serious about buying the product, I need you to meet me at this price.",10350.0,Alice,7,
