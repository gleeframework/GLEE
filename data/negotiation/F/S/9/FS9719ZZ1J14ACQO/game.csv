"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it!  I'm asking $200 for it.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to do $150?  I'm sure we can reach a deal.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is a little too low for me. How about $175? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $162.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",162.5,Bob,4,
