{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $200 is more than my limit, so I'll reject and see if I can get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to do $150?  I'm sure we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is a little too low for me. How about $175? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $162.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now."", ""product_price"": 162.5}
