"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. I'm confident you'll find this to be an attractive proposition. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
