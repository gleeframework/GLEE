"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You have a clear ceiling of $150, so you can potentially save more money by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend around $100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your desired price point of $100. There is still room for negotiation, and you have 7 rounds left. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $100. How about we settle on $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I can offer it to you for $108. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice has come down from $110 to $108, which is closer to your desired price of $100. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  You've already had 4 rounds of negotiation, and with 6 rounds left, it's getting closer to your fallback option of buying from John. 
* **Small Difference:** While $108 is still $8 above your ideal price, it's a relatively small difference, and it's likely Alice won't go lower. 

It's a good deal, and accepting it allows you to secure the product without risking the chance of having to pay John's higher price."
