"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still competitive. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows you're serious about getting a good deal.

* **Justification:** Explain your offer by highlighting the value you see in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still struggling to reach that price point. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. I'm still not quite there.  $1,300,000 is my limit.
