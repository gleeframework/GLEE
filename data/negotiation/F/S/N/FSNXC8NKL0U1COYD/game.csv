"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for negotiations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm open to finding a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
