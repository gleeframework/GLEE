Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (because John acts as a guaranteed backup).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $800,000 and $1,000,000.  Any price within this range could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other buyers, you create a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **High Anchor:** $950,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still staying above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, highlight the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high number.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You might need to negotiate a bit to reach a final agreement."
