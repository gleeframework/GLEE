"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I have a strict budget, and $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to look elsewhere.  Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,
