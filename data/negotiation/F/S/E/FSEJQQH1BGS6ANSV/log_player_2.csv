Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $8,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reviewing your latest offer, I am proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. This price aims to balance the value offered by the product with your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still $1,000 above his target price.  While he could continue to negotiate, he's already gone through several rounds and there's a good chance that Alice won't come down to his price.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
