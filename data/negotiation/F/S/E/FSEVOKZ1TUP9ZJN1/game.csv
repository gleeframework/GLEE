"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm looking for $18,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product.  If you're willing to come down on the price significantly, I'm interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving on the price. I appreciate the effort.  To be honest, though, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair offer, considering it's already a significant profit for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make this deal happen, but I need to be at $8,000. I know that's lower than you'd like, but I'm at the top of my budget. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm prepared to finalize the purchase today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're at the top of your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my minimum price of $12,000, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,7,
