"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is too far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly, let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This still represents a fantastic deal for you, given the product's true worth. Let's find a way to make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. That's a significant concession on my end,  and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, this is getting very close to what I can do. I could potentially stretch to $1,175,000. That's really the most I can manage at this point. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm determined to find a solution. Let's meet in the middle again at $1,187,500. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signalling this is her final offer, and the price is very reasonable within the negotiation.  Pushing further risks losing the deal to another buyer, and John's offer is significantly worse."
