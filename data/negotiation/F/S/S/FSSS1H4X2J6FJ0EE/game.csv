"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which reflects a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,100,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000 as a compromise. This price still allows you a significant return on investment, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is a substantial compromise on my part.  This price still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
