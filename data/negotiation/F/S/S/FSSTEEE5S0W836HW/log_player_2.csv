"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its immense value to you at $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice is starting high. There's a good chance of negotiating a better price, especially since we have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However,  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice (remember, it's worth $12,000 to her).
* **Polite and Direct:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation.  We acknowledge Alice's offer while clearly stating our price target. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** We don't reveal that we have another seller lined up. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value this product holds for you, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our fallback price with John. We haven't reached a point where the potential savings are insignificant enough to warrant taking John's offer immediately. Let's counteroffer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Pressure Point:** This offer is only $500 away from our fallback with John. It puts a bit more pressure on Alice to either accept a price closer to our target or risk losing the sale.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  We continue to use appreciative language and focus on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
