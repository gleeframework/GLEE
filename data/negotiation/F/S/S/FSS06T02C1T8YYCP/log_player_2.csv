{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $115. This is a good deal, but I can potentially do better.
* It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is $5 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* This is a reasonable starting point, as it shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a good deal.
* I have 9 rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still below the price I'm willing to pay from John.
* I have 8 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate a better price. 
* I'm confident I can get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my previous counteroffer but still lower than what I'm willing to pay from John.
* This time, I'm increasing my counteroffer by only $2 to show I'm willing to compromise. 
* My goal is to find a price that works for both of us. 
* It's likely Alice will counter back, so I need to be ready to negotiate further in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now above the price I'm willing to pay from John.
* I've already negotiated with Alice for a few rounds and haven't been able to secure a price lower than what John is offering.
* It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice as there's a high chance I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* I'm better off buying the product from John at $120."
