# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than what Bob would pay John ($12,000). Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer."
