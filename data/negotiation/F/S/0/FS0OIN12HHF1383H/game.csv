"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is a very fair price for this product.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
