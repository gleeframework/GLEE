Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit, and $12,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  Bob will see this as a good deal for him, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with. Good luck with your negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob and your initial offer.  You want to maximize your profit, so you should try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's a significant increase from Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but not willing to drastically lower your price.
* **It's still lower than your initial offer:** This shows you're open to finding a middle ground.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer further.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I still think $9,000 is a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's the closest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you would ideally get more,  $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000 and represents a good profit for you.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point, considering the possibility of a lengthy negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
