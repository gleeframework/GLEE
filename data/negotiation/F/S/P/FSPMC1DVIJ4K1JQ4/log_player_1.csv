Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved in waiting for John's purchase.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's perceived value. If you *did* know Bob valued it at $8,000, a price closer to that amount would be more strategic."
