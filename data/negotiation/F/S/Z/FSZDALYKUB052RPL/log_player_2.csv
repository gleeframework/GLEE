Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $125, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  It's better to secure the product from John at $120 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
