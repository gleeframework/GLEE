"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but the product is worth more than that to me. Could you meet me halfway at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $150 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go a little higher, but $130 is still pushing it.  How about $115, and we have a deal?",115.0,Bob,6,
