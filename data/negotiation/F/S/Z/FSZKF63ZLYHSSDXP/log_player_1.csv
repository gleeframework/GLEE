Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I am willing to reduce my price a bit to secure a sale, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to Bob for $90 still allows me to make a profit above my minimum threshold of $120.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and John if I keep negotiating."
