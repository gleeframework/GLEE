"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000.

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it more appealing to you. I'm willing to throw in some additional services and support that will enhance the product's value to you. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I'd like to add a 2% premium to the price, making it $943500. What do you think?",943500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the additional services and support, Alice. I appreciate the effort you're putting into making this deal more appealing. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I'd like to propose a 1.5% premium instead of the 2% you mentioned. This would put the price at $938750. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to my business. What do you think?",938750.0,Bob,6,
