"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for his maximum price, $1,000,000. This counteroffer is bold, but it establishes his firm price point and puts the pressure on Alice to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, but it's still too high for Bob.  He should reject the offer and try to continue negotiating. While he could buy from John, he's still within his budget and has time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise, but he's staying within his budget. This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Alice and reach a deal before he has to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's desired price point, even if she's lowered the price slightly. There are still rounds available, so Bob can continue to negotiate and try to reach a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  He wants to see if he can get Alice to come down closer to $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's increasing his offer to show he's serious about negotiating, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This move is a calculated risk, as it could push Alice to reject his counteroffer again. However, if Alice is willing to compromise, they could reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation has reached a point where Alice isn't budging much further.  The rounds are getting limited, and Bob is running out of time to secure a better price. Although buying from John would mean he gets the product at his maximum price, it's the most sensible decision at this point. He doesn't want to risk losing the deal completely with Alice, and it's better to accept a known price than to continue negotiating with the possibility of no agreement at all."
