"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $9,500.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's minimum value ($8,000) as possible.  $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Not too low:** Offering $8,000 outright might risk Alice walking away entirely, as it would leave her with no profit.
* **Setting a new boundary:**  This counteroffer establishes a new negotiation range for the product.  Alice now has to decide if she's willing to come down to meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get it for less than $9,000.
* **Avoiding immediate purchase:**  Accepting Alice's offer now would mean Bob misses out on potentially getting the product for an even lower price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** A counteroffer at this point could potentially get Alice closer to Bob's desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less, though.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and reach an agreement. 
* **Remaining within budget:** $8,750 is still within Bob's $10,000 limit, making it a reasonable offer.
* **Pressing for a deal:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a final counteroffer."
