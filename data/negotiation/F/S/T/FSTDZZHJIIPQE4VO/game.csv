"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value this brings.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'll offer $12,750.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
