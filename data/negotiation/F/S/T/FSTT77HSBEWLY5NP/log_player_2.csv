"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000 for the product."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your price point, $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price reflects the product's value and still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That would be a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer,  $9,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This would be a fair compromise that meets both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly below $10,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
