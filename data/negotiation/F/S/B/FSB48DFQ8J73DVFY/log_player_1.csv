"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation if necessary.  I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable, and I believe this price is within his range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $10,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering $11,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise.  I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm not willing to sell below $10,000.  I'll try to reach a compromise with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's the best offer I've received from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with him by continuing to negotiate."
