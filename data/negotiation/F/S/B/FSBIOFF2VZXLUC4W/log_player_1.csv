Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000.  I think this is a fair price considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price while still framing it as a fair deal.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning listing it publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still leaving me with the guaranteed option of selling to John for $8,000 if needed."
