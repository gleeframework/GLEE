Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and aware of the product's value. While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product offers."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $10,500 is a reasonable profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
