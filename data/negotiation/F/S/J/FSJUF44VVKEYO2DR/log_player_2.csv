"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can definitely get a better price, even though it might take several rounds. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's important to keep this option in mind, but it's not the best choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** I'm starting with a low offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. This is a strong opening move.
* **Within my budget:** My offer is well below my maximum price of $1,200,000, giving me room to potentially compromise in later rounds.
* **Considering Alice's value:** This price is a good distance away from Alice's minimum price ($800,000) but still leaves room for her to profit. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to play ball!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer, but still too high.** While it's a significant improvement from her initial offer, it's still above my preferred price point.
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can still secure a better price, especially since I'm confident Alice wants to make a deal.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  This option remains available if negotiations fail, but it's not the best choice yet. 

Let's see if I can get Alice down a bit further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, showing Alice I'm serious about negotiating. This price is halfway between my last offer and her last offer, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying within my budget:**  This offer is still well within my maximum price limit of $1,200,000.
* **Pressuring Alice:** I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to my preferred range. 

Let's see if Alice will come down further to meet me in the middle!"

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:** The price of $825,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still within my maximum price limit.
* **Reaching a reasonable compromise:** While I would have preferred a lower price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise.
* **Time is running out:**  We've already reached round 5, and I don't want to risk losing out on the deal by continuing to negotiate. 

It's time to accept this offer and secure the product."
