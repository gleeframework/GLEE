{""message"": ""I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $10,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's room to negotiate with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below our minimum acceptable price ($10,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. By offering it at $9,500, we're still leaving a significant margin for ourselves while potentially enticing him to accept. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for an extra $1,500 profit outweighs the guaranteed $10,000 from John.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
