"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The offer is far higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  There's no reason to even consider a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob is offering Alice his maximum price, which is the same price John is willing to sell the product for.  This is a strong opening counteroffer, and  it puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to sell for a lower price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from her initial price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He's already established that he's willing to pay $1,000,000, and there's no reason to go higher than that. He should continue negotiating and see if he can bring Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but also that he's not desperate. This gives him some room to maneuver if Alice wants to counter again, but also shows he's serious about getting a deal closer to his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's only $150,000 above his target price, which is a reasonable compromise considering he's already secured a lower price from Alice.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at his full budget."
