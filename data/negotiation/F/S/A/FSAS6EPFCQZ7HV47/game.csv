"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $900,000. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant step from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not ready to give up. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
