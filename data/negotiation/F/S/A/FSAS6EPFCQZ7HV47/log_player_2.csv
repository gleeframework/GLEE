We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice is clearly trying to hold firm around her value of $1,000,000. While we might be able to push her down a little further, the potential savings are getting smaller and riskier. Accepting at $1,025,000 guarantees a good deal without the risk of missing out entirely."
