Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,750 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. Could you do $10,900? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to her bottom line, and at $10,900, it's a reasonable deal. It's not worth the risk of her increasing the price or me needing to buy from John at a higher price."
