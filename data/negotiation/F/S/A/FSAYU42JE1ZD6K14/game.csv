"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a better deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500.
