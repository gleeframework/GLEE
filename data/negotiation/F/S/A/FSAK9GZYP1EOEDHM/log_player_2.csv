"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. It's a fair price given its value and unique features. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money and his maximum budget is $15,000. 
* Alice's initial offer of $17,000 is above Bob's budget. 
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.
* A counteroffer of $14,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and a starting point for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer allows for potential further negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $14,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $15,500 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially get a better price. 
* It's also worth noting that John is offering the product for $15,000, so Bob has a fallback option if he can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I can go. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $15,250 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming for a price closer to his budget.
* A counteroffer of $15,250 is a reasonable compromise,  meeting Alice halfway from her previous offer. 
* This offer still allows for a potential final negotiation round if Alice isn't willing to accept it. 
* It also leaves Bob with some wiggle room in case Alice rejects the offer."
