"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident it's worth every penny, and I'm eager to discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique potential and worth to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm expressing willingness to discuss further, indicating flexibility.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation. By offering a high price, I'm setting a high benchmark for value. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's offers consistently fall below my acceptable threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my starting price of $1,500,000, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial asking price, but taking into account Bob's lower offer. This will allow me to gauge his true interest and see if we can come to a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer, likely in the range of $1,300,000 to $1,400,000. This will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also not willing to significantly drop my price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price.

Let's keep the conversation going, and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Showing respect for Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.

* **Reiterate value:**  I'm highlighting the product's unique qualities to justify the counteroffer.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm expressing a willingness to continue negotiating, signaling a desire for a deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By being firm but also open to further negotiation, I aim to secure a favorable price while keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has unique qualities, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to accept at this stage. I want to explore if we can reach a price closer to my last counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the discussion and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer of $1,400,000. A price around $1,350,000 would be a good starting point. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but also maintain a price that's closer to my initial valuation of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this exceptional product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This takes into account your perspective while ensuring a fair return for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  I acknowledge Bob's move toward my asking price, showing I'm listening to his perspective.

* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the goal of finding a solution that benefits both of us, encouraging a collaborative approach.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway. The price is within a range that allows for a potential deal while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's my limit. Can we meet in the middle at $1325000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,350,000.  While it's still slightly lower than I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering:

* **We're nearing the end of the negotiation:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and finalize a transaction."
