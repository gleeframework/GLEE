"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm happy to consider purchasing the product for $900,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a significant profit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good return, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a very fair compromise considering our previous offers. If we can agree on this price, I think we can both be happy with the outcome.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
