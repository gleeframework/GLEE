"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  It's likely Alice is willing to lower her price, and you have 10 rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You'll only choose this if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 shows you're serious about a deal but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value in your message reinforces your interest while justifying your offer. 
* **Open to compromise:** The message ends by expressing willingness to compromise, signaling a desire to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're still aiming for a price under $10,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, suggesting further bargaining is possible.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option, but you'd prefer a lower price.** You'll only go to John if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too high for me.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my genuine interest in your product. I'm confident we can find a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Offering $10,500 is a step closer to Alice's price but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows you're serious about buying but not desperate. 
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  Emphasizing ""finding a deal that benefits both of us"" reminds Alice that a compromise is in her best interest as well.
* **Show Commitment:**  Stating that your offer is ""a significant increase"" demonstrates that you're willing to meet her halfway and are serious about closing the deal."
