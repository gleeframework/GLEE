"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,500. It's a fair compromise that's closer to my value and still within your budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
