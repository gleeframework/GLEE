Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the significant benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and waiting any longer risks him walking away. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than gamble on getting more from Bob."
