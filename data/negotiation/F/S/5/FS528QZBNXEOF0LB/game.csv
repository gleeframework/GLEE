"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the significant benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
