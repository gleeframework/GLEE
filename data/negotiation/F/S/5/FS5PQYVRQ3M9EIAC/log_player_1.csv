Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where both you and Bob have room to maneuver. You're leaving some profit for Bob while still securing a significant gain for yourself.  It also sets the tone that you're open to negotiation, but are confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You've already secured a price significantly above your minimum, and Bob has shown a willingness to pay close to your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation,  $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
