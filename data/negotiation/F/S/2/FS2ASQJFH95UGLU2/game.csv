"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product's value is substantial, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to go to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
