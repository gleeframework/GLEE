"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $13,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $13,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it would be a great deal for you.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That would work for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
