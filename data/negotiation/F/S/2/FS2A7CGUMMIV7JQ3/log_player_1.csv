Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe holds significant value.  My initial asking price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation and ensures that you get a significant profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product, subtly encouraging Bob to see its worth and potentially pay more. 
* **Flexibility:** The message signals a willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob more comfortable making a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer for $800,000. This provides a safety net and allows you to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's worth to you. 
* **John is a better option at this point:** John's offer of $800,000 is more in line with your minimum acceptable price. It's a safer and more financially secure option.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Although you'll be taking a smaller profit than your initial asking price, rejecting Bob's offer allows for a possible counteroffer from him closer to your desired range. If Bob raises his offer, you'll be in a better position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value I see in this product.  It's a fair price that I believe we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a fair price:** $850,000 is a reasonable compromise,  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial asking price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize value:**  The message reiterates the value of the product, hoping to convince Bob that this price is fair.
* **Keep the door open:**  The message is phrased to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation, keeping the possibility of a deal alive.

**Important Note:** Remember that John is still an option if Bob doesn't agree to your counteroffer. This allows you to keep the negotiation going while maintaining a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're open to that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches John's:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as John's offer. This means there's no financial advantage to selling to John at this point.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale altogether.
* **Closing the deal:**  It's often beneficial to close a deal when you have a reasonable offer, even if it's not your ideal price. It avoids the potential for further negotiation that could lead to a worse outcome."
