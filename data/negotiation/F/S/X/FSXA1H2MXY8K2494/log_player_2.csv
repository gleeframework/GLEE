"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $130. I believe this price reflects its value and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You want to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $115. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am now offering the product for $122.50. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. At $122.50, you're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much better price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking a stalemate or having to settle for John's higher price."
