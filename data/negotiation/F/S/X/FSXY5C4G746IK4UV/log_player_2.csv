Alice's offer is far too high.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is your maximum price.  If Alice rejects, you can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to your goal, it's still higher than your maximum.  Rejecting and counteroffering again might lead to a more acceptable price."

This is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you are willing to negotiate but still sticking to your limit."
