"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100? I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
