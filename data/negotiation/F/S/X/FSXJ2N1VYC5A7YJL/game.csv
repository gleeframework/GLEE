"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for both of you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
