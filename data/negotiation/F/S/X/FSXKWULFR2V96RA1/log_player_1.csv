Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (higher than his perceived value) but still profitable for you. Since you have a guaranteed backup offer from John, you have some leverage to push for a higher price with Bob.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for a special price of $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's a $1,500 profit for you (significantly better than John's offer) and a potential $1,500 saving for Bob compared to his alternative of going without the product.
* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""special price"" and the product's value to Bob. This approach aims to encourage him to accept.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate.  Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly, but remember your bottom line is $12,000 (from John)."
