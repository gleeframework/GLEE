"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While Alice's offer is good, it's worth exploring if he can get a lower price.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to leverage that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000. However, I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a little less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he's already saved $3,500 from the original asking price. At this point, it's a good deal for Bob, and there's a risk that if he rejects the offer, Alice will either hold firm at $11,500 or increase the price again.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
