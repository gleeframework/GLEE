"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have budget constraints. I could consider a price closer to  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding you have budget considerations.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than what I can justify. This product would be a worthwhile investment for me at a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to be flexible, but that price point is a firm requirement for me to move forward.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is undeniable. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the significant value it holds.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm sticking to my budget.  If you can't do  $950,000 for this product, I have to explore other options. I need to know by the next round if this works for you, as my other option is time-sensitive.",950000.0,Bob,6,
