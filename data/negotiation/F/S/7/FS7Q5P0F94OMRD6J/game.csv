"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good deal, but $10000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11000.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about $10500?  It's a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10750.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
