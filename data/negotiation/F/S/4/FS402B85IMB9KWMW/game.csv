,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $105? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $105, which would be $92.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",92.5,Bob,6,
