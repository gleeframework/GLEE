{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $15000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below what it's worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to make a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get more, $10,000 is a fair price and aligns with my minimum value for the product.  It also saves me time and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
