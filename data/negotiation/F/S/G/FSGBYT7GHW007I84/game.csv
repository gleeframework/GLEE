"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get it into your hands. I'm offering the product to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm confident that the product's value to you will far exceed $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, as I mentioned before. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
