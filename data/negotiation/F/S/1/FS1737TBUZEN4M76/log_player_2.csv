# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I believe you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting this product, but I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $175,000 off John's price."
