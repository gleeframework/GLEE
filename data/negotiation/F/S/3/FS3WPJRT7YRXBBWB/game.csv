"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This gives you a chance to acquire it at a slightly advantageous price, and allows me to secure a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
