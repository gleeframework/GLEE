"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To start, I propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's maximum value for the product is $15,000, and he knows Alice's minimum value is $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting allows Bob to send a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer and Alice doesn't counter with a lower price, he can still purchase from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $13,500 for the product. This allows us to maintain a fair deal while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has countered with $13,500, which is still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal. It's better than buying from John at $15,000 and it also shows that Alice is willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer is a smart move for Bob, as it minimizes his risk and allows him to secure the product at a reasonable price."
