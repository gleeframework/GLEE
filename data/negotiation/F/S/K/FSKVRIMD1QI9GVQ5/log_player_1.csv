Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  I'm still a little hesitant at $10,750. How about we meet at $10,600? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,600 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to close the deal now.  I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
