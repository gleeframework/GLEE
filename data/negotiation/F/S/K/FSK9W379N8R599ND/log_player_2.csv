"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what you'd get from anyone else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
