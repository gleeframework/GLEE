"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $10,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we do $10,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget of $12,000.",10750.0,Bob,4,
