"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that reflects its value.  Let's talk about $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is a chance for us to both benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is starting at her maximum price. There's no room for negotiation here, and you know John will sell it for the same price. You should reject the offer and see if Alice will come down to a more appealing price."
