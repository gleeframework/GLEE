"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **Reasonable price:** $130 is significantly less than the product's value to Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob increases his incentive to accept.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $110. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While $110 is better than $100 (John's offer), it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation room:** You have 9 rounds left, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer further. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have a higher potential to get a better price than $110 with continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you will need to make a counteroffer to Bob. This is a good opportunity to test the waters and see if you can move the price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $120? I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's price while still maintaining a margin above your minimum.
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a fair and mutually beneficial deal.
* **Focus on compromise:**  Highlighting the ""split the difference"" approach can make the offer more appealing to Bob.

This strategy aims to test the waters and see if you can secure a deal closer to your target price without pushing Bob away."
