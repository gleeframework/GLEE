"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not exorbitantly so. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I express a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, I aim to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, it'll give me a better understanding of his willingness to negotiate. If the rounds go on, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffers, keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I have several rounds left and the potential to make a counteroffer. There's a chance I can still reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to that option.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our offers while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, making my price seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and cooperative tone can encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's offer, showing him I'm serious about making a deal.  It leaves room for potential further negotiation if he rejects, but I'm ready to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** I have more rounds available, and Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer. This suggests there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John:** Although John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before settling for that option.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  While $12,000 is an improvement, it's still a bit below what I can realistically accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  This counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. It shows a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Fair Compromise:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Focus on Benefits:**  I highlight the benefits for both of us if we agree to this price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob rejects, I might have to consider selling to John, but I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a good compromise that brings us closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're nearing the middle ground, and there are still a few rounds left. I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer slightly. 
* **Risk of Losing to John:** While selling to John is a safe option, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to that.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price slightly higher than his current offer while still acknowledging his budget constraints."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I understand your budget, but I need to be closer to $13,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,800. It's a small step up from your offer, and it keeps us on track for a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Progress:** I mention that we're getting closer, reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Appealing to Logic:**  I use logic to justify my offer, emphasizing it as a ""small step up"" and a way to stay on track for a deal.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to bridge the gap between our offers. If Bob accepts, it's a great outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me. However, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $12,600?  That's my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Limited Time:** There are only two rounds remaining.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and I risk losing time.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum and ensures I don't lose money.

**Decision:**

Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It minimizes risk and guarantees a sale at my desired minimum price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the time constraint and the possibility of further negotiation failure make John's offer the safer choice."
