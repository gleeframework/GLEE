Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still a significant profit for me, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a better deal.
* **Keeping John in mind:** $130 is a good starting point, but if Bob doesn't accept, I can always go back to John for my guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
* **Protecting my minimum value:**  I want to avoid selling the product for less than $150, which is my baseline.

**Next move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  That would give us both a good deal, and I'm still making a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my last offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $110 is still well above my minimum value of $150, so I'm not sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is stubborn:** Bob's counteroffer is only $5 higher than his previous offer. This indicates that he's unwilling to budge much further.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is taking time, and I risk getting stuck in a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is my minimum value and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

**Conclusion:** While I could try one more counteroffer, it's more likely that I'll end up with a price closer to Bob's preferred $95 than my desired $110. Selling to John is the best option to secure my minimum value and avoid further negotiation with a potentially stubborn buyer."
