"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is willing to sell the same product for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or explore other options."
