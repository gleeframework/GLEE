"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to be flexible but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to take the $10,500 now than potentially get nothing from Bob and then have to sell to John for $10,000."
