"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
