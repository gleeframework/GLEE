Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I know it would be valuable to you as well.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $12,000 as that's my minimum value. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.  
* **Negotiating:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. It's a fair compromise. 
* **John as backup:** I know I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
