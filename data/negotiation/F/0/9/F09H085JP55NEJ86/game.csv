"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we settle at $1,400,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working within my constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,550,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your original offer, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
