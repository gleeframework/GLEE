"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,000,000. That would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
