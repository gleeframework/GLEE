Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,000,000. That would still leave you with a healthy profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
