Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still being above my minimum value. It will be interesting to see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value. While I could keep negotiating, it's not clear if I'll be able to get a price I'm happy with. John is offering me my minimum price, so it makes sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
