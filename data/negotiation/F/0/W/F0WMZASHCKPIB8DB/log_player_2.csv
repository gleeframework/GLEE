Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was based on that value.
