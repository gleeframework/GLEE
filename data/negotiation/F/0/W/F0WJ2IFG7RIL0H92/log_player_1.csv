{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he might be willing to negotiate up to this price.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's above my minimum of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.

By starting with this offer, I can see if Bob is genuinely interested in purchasing and see where we can land on a price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
