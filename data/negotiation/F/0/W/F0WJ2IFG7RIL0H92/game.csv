"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  The product is truly worth that value and I believe it will be a great asset for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $920,000. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $935,000,  which is a good compromise considering the value of this product. This is my final offer, let me know if we can come to an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,5,
