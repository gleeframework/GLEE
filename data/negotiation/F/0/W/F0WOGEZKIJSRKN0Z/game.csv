"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it for a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",8000.0,Alice,3,
