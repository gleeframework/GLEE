"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price.  We should counteroffer significantly lower to test her willingness to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it for a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Alice has met our alternative price.  There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
