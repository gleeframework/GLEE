"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
