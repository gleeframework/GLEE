Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is clearly very far off from my valuation. It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that works for me.
