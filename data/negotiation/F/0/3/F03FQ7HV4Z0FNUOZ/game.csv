"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a lower price. I'm asking $12000 for it. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss it further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
