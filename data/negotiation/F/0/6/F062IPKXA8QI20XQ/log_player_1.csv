{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to make a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is within Bob's potential budget, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This ensures you are still making a profit above your minimum price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've already stated that it's a fair price, implying there might be some wiggle room.

Remember, this is just the first offer.  You'll need to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for you. While it's tempting to consider his offer due to his interest in the product, it's crucial to stick to your financial goals.

By rejecting his offer, you can continue negotiating and try to reach a more favorable price. You can use the knowledge that Bob is interested and willing to negotiate to your advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $1,350,000? This price is closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:** This counter-offer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your financial interests.
* **Emphasize compromise:** The message focuses on finding a ""compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain your position:**  While you've lowered your price, you've also reiterated that $1,200,000 is not acceptable, making it clear you won't go any lower.

This counter-offer positions you well to either close the deal or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is still below your ideal price, it's getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point:

* **Limited negotiation space:**  Bob has clearly stated his maximum price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting his offer might push him to walk away from the deal, leaving you with John as the only buyer, but at a price you'd prefer to avoid.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this deal is slightly less favorable than your ideal, securing a sale with Bob could open doors to future deals with him, potentially at higher prices.

By accepting Bob's offer, you ensure a sale with a relatively good profit margin and maintain a good relationship with a potential future customer."
