"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? This would still give you a substantial savings compared to your initial valuation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to compromise further though.  How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also giving you a significant discount.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
