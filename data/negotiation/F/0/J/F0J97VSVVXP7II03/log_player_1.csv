"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is exactly what John is offering, and I've already established that my minimum is $10,000. I'm going to accept and move on."
