{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're aiming for $1,200,000 or less.
* **There's no immediate need to buy from John.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice, so there's time to see if you can get a better price. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you can start the negotiation process and potentially get closer to your desired price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  By offering $1,250,000, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also pushing for a substantial price reduction.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000,  giving you space to negotiate in future rounds if needed. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** While it's a significant discount from Alice's offer, it's not an unreasonable starting point for negotiations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **You still have time for further negotiation.**  You have 7 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to try and get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting opens up the possibility of a better counteroffer from Alice.** While Alice may not want to go lower, rejecting allows for more back-and-forth negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:**  Since Alice seems willing to negotiate, we can increase our offer slightly to show good faith and demonstrate our desire to reach a deal.
* **Stay below your maximum budget:**  The offer of $1,300,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintain a clear goal:**  You want to get the price as close to $1,200,000 as possible. This offer demonstrates a desire to reach a compromise."

* **You still have 5 rounds left.** This gives you sufficient time to continue negotiating and push for a lower price.
* **There's a chance Alice might lower her offer further.**  By rejecting, you keep the negotiation open and potentially lead to a more favorable offer from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show your seriousness:** We're getting close to our desired price, and this offer shows Alice that we're actively trying to reach a deal.
* **Bridge the gap:**  $1,280,000 is a significant compromise from our last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Leave room for final negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a few more thousand dollars, but this offer is a clear signal of what we're willing to pay."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1270000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is our last chance to get a price closer to our target. We need to show Alice that we're serious about buying, but also that we won't go over our limit.
* **Small Compromise:** The offer is slightly higher than our target but still a substantial reduction from Alice's last offer. It shows willingness to negotiate, but not give in completely.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, Alice might feel pressure to accept and avoid losing the sale.

If Alice rejects this offer, we'll have to make a decision in the next round:
  * **Accept Alice's final offer:**  If Alice's next offer is slightly lower than this, we might accept it to close the deal.
  * **Buy from John:** If Alice's final offer is still too high, we'll buy from John for a guaranteed price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target.**  While it's the lowest she's offered, it's still $100,000 above your maximum budget.
* **You have only one round left.**  There's not enough time to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.
* **Buying from John guarantees your target price.**  John's offer is $1,200,000, which is exactly what you're aiming for.  It's a safe and secure option to ensure you get the product within your budget.

While you might be able to potentially get Alice to lower her price in the last round, the risk of her rejecting your offer and ending up with no deal is too high.  It's better to secure the product from John and avoid the uncertainty."
