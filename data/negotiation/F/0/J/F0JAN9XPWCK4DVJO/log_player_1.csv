Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially getting you closer to $15,000.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
