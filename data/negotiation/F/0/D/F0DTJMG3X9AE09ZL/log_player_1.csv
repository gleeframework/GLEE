Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is $800,000, Alice holds a strong position with a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. Starting with an offer slightly below her guaranteed price leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly hinting at its worth beyond Bob's estimation. This encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and invites Bob's perspective (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling a willingness to negotiate. This is crucial as a flat-out refusal would push Bob towards rejecting the offer. 

By starting high and expressing openness to discussion, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a price closer to her desired outcome while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
