"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows for some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product if he believes it's valuable. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $15,000, I'm still hoping to earn more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll see what counteroffer he makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower.  While I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see what he counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to stick with a price that's closer to my minimum value. $16,000 feels like a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, but Bob is still pushing to pay less.  The risk of going lower is that I might not get a good deal, and I'm already running out of rounds. I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $15,000."
