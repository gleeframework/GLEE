"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $90. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is my absolute minimum.  What do you think?",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $75 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $67? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",67.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $67 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $70.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",70.0,Alice,5,
