# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
