Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if needed.  I'm confident that I can get at least $150 from John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160, which is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price. It's also a good chance to close the deal and move on."
