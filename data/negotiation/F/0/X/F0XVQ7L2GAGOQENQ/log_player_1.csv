Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving myself open to counteroffers, but I have a safety net with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still potential to reach a better price by counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, so I can afford to be firm with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** Highlighting that the price is a good deal for both of us might make Bob more receptive.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying polite and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer $7,750. That's a significant increase from my last offer, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $7,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob driving the price down even further.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John secures my minimum value and eliminates any further negotiation risks."
