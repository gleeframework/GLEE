"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is my best price, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $11,500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and buy the product for $10,000, as further negotiation with Alice may not result in a better price."
