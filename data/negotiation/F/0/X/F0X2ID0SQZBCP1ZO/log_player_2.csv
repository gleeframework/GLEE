"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than you're paying. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Targeting Below Value:** My goal is to pay significantly less than my maximum budget ($12,000) and ideally closer to Alice's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $7,000 leaves space for Alice to counter and potentially still reach a price that's good for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $9,000 is closer to a reasonable price, there's still a significant gap between her offer and my initial counteroffer. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I want to see if I can push for a better deal. 
* **Avoiding a Rushed Decision:**  We're only on Round 3 of 10. There's no need to jump at this offer yet. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $8,000? That seems like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Her Value:** I'm now offering Alice her estimated product value of $8,000. This is a strong negotiating tactic, as it positions the offer as very fair to her. 
* **Signaling Willingness to Deal:**  By going directly to $8,000, I'm indicating I'm serious about buying and ready to close the deal if she's willing.
* **Leaving Backup Options:** If she rejects this offer, I still have the option to negotiate further or take John's offer of $12,000."
