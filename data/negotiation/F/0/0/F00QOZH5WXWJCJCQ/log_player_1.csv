Bob is unlikely to budge further, and at this point, accepting his offer would net me only $2,500 more than John's guaranteed offer. The risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob isn't worth the small potential gain. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
