Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're determined to get this product, and I appreciate your persistence.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $880,000, which is still $80,000 above Bob's target price.  While it's tempting to try one more round, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  With only one round left, the risk of a stalemate is high. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $800,000, it's the most sensible choice at this point.  He can save $80,000 by going with John, ensuring a successful transaction and staying within his budget."
