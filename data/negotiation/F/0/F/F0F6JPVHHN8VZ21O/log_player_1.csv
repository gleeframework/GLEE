Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $20,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to see some more flexibility from you.

While further negotiation with Bob is possible, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price without further risk of losing the sale."
