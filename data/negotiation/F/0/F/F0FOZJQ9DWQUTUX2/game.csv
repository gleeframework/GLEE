"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll gain from it.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $800,000 is below its true value, I'm open to finding a compromise.  To move things along, I propose $1,900,000. This reflects the significant worth this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest in acquiring this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to strike a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This is a substantial increase from my last offer and a fair reflection of the value we both recognize in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
