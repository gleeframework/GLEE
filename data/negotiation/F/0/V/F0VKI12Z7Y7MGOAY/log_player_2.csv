"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $12,000. Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product and save $2,000. 

While you could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer.  Buying from John at $12,000 is a worse outcome than accepting Alice's offer."
