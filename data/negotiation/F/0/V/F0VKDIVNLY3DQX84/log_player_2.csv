"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as there's potential to save money. You can also use the threat of buying from John as leverage during the negotiations."

You've already made significant progress in the negotiation, and it's wiser to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with rather than risking a further stalemate or a higher price."
