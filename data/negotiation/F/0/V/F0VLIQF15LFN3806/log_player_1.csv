"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a profit, while being a more reasonable price for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to come to an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950,000. I believe there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards an agreement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get what I need, while also being within your budget.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
