"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a profit, while being a more reasonable price for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to come to an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards an agreement.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get what I need, while also being within your budget.  Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and Alice is now offering it at that price.  This is a win-win situation, as Bob gets the product at his target price, and Alice gets to sell it at her minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
