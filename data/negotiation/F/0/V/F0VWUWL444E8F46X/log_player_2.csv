# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it at $95. This is a good starting point for negotiation. You should try to get a better price."

You are still within your price range, and Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's still room for improvement.  You should counteroffer again."
