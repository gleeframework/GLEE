"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both parties.",9800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above the price you're looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be within a budget of $9500. Would you be willing to go down to $9200?",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9350. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both parties.",9350.0,Alice,5,
