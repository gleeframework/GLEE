"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price ($120), it's still cheaper than buying from John ($120).
* **You still get the product:** Your goal is to get the product, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
