"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that immediately. Bob is clearly trying to get a good deal, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is a good price, considering my minimum is $80. It's a fair compromise and we're close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's best to avoid risking losing the deal by going back and forth further."
