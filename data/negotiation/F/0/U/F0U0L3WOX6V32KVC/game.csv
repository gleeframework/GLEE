"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. This product represents a unique opportunity and I'm offering it to you first.  To kick things off, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant value that I'm confident will deliver for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal here. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this reflects the value you're getting and allows me to feel good about the deal as well. What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,090,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,060,000? This would be a fair deal for both parties and avoids having to go to John.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I value finding a fair deal with you, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1,080,000?  This feels like a good compromise where we both feel good about the agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,070,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal before I need to consider John's offer.",1070000.0,Bob,8,
