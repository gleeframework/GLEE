{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for potential bargaining. This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the value I placed on the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$120 is a good price, and it's likely that we won't be able to negotiate a higher price. It's also a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
