"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is less than his maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $10,500? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and his own desired price. This is a reasonable starting point that shows he's willing to negotiate but also values the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he wants to pay. He's willing to continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price.  Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference, offering a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest one.  This shows he's serious about finding a compromise while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $11,000. Bob knows that he can buy the product from John for $12,000, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option for him. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that he'll run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
