"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above my minimum of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest as it's below the value he places on the product. I'm also being friendly and confident to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of trying to get a price closer to my ideal price while still being reasonable.  $125 is still a good deal for Bob and leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing that this is a good deal for him and trying to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$120 is a good price, considering my minimum is $100.  I've made a good profit and the negotiation process is taking longer than I'd like.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
