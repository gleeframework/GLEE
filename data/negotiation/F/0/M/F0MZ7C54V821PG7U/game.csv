"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
