Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Considering its worth to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to secure the highest possible price, exceeding your minimum ($1,200,000) and getting as close to Bob's valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency encourages Bob to decide quickly and not risk losing the opportunity.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome for you as the seller."
