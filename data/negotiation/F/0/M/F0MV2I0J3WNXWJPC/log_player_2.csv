Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to make an offer to buy it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about negotiating.  $8,000 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $9200?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to my target price, it's still a bit high.  I want to see if I can push Alice down further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer again and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  $8,500 is a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's last offer, and it signals that you're serious about making a deal."
