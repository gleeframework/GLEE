"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$140 is getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is a final attempt to get a price closer to my desired $150.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John."

Bob isn't willing to go any higher, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
