"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He wants to save as much money as possible, and $12,000 is still above his budget.  He should counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my initial expectation, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $11,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can try to get a better deal by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $11,000? This price is fair considering the value we both place on the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  He has limited rounds left and it's unlikely he will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget, so he should take that deal."
