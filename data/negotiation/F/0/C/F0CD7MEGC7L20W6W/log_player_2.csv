"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I believe this price reflects its worth and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have the advantage of knowing you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is still a substantial profit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further, potentially meeting her halfway again at $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is closer to my target, but still above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk Alice walking away and leaving me with no options.  I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best deal for me at this point."
