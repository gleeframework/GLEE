"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage.  If he rejects this offer, it will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  It's likely that Bob's initial offer was just a starting point and that he is willing to pay more.  I need to see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it is closer to my target than his previous offer, I believe there is still potential to get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows that I am willing to be flexible and negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if this slight concession will entice Bob to come closer to my price. If he rejects this offer again, I'm prepared to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it is still below my desired price. I will reject his offer and try to push him a bit further.  At this point, I am still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob than what John is offering. However, if Bob doesn't come up with a better offer in the next round, I will likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $10,500.  This is a small concession, but it signals to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It's getting close to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell. If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while it's tempting to try and get a little more from Bob,  it's not worth risking missing out on the guaranteed $12,000 from John. I'm going to sell to John."
