Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's less than what the product is worth to me, but significantly more than what it's worth to Bob. It maximizes the chance of him accepting the offer while still getting me closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000, so this offer is a win-win situation for me."
