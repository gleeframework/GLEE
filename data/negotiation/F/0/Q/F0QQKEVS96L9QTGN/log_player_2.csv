Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $110 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the price increasing or losing the deal altogether."
