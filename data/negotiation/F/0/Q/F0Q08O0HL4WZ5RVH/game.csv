"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. This is my top offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15000 is significantly lower than the value of the product to me. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking to my original offer of $15000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",15000.0,Bob,4,
