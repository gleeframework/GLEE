Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. He's already shown interest, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of him. I'm confident I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. How about we split the difference and settle at $135? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can do $130, but that's pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $150, but it's still a significant amount less than what John is willing to pay. However, with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a decent profit and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds."
