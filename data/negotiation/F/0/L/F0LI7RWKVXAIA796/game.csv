"Alice, $20,000 is much higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be able to get good use out of the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if $10,000 is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
