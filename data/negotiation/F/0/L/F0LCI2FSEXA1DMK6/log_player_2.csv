Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, so I expect you to consider it seriously.

Alice is unwilling to budge from her minimum price. Since you can buy the product for the same price from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
