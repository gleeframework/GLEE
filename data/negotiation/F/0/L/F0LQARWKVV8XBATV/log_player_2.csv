You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

$13,000 is a good price, better than buying from John for $15,000. It's worth accepting the offer rather than risking a further negotiation."
