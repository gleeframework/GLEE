"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  Starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob gives us room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** We emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Open Invitation:** We leave the door open for discussion and allow Bob to express his thoughts. 
* **No immediate threat:**  We don't mention John yet to avoid scaring Bob away and risking a quick rejection. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly lower than the product's worth to us, and we can likely get closer to our desired price.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  We have 8 rounds left, and there's room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal our willingness to hold out for a more favorable price.
* **John is a safety net:**  While we're willing to negotiate with Bob, knowing that John is willing to pay $800,000 gives us a solid backup plan. 

**Next Round:** We will counteroffer with a price closer to our initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. We'll also reiterate the value of the product and our willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? This price acknowledges your budget while also reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above his initial suggestion. 
* **Value Proposition:** We reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  We emphasize a ""win-win"" scenario by highlighting that both parties would benefit from this compromise. 

**Important Note:** We're still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, but we're remaining optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's value, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $775,000? This price shows I'm serious about the deal, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above our minimum:** Bob's offer of $775,000 is still above our minimum of $800,000.  We're not desperate to sell, and we're confident we can squeeze out a better deal.
* **John is our safety net:** We have John's offer of $800,000 as a backup, so we can afford to be a bit more assertive in our negotiations.
* **Momentum towards a higher price:** Bob has already raised his offer from $750,000 to $775,000.  We can likely get him to move even closer to our desired price. 

**Next Round:** We'll counter with a price closer to $800,000, emphasizing that this deal represents a significant gain for both parties and that time is running out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still not quite there.  We're both nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we settle on $800,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this transaction quickly. Time is of the essence, and I want to ensure we both get the best possible outcome."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** We're proposing our minimum price, signaling a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Time Pressure:** We subtly introduce the element of time, highlighting the urgency of reaching a deal and implying that we may not be willing to continue negotiating indefinitely. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** We reiterate the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and mutual benefit. 
* **Positive Outlook:** We maintain a positive and optimistic tone, aiming to create a sense of urgency without seeming desperate. 

**Important Note:** This is a critical round. If Bob rejects this offer, we'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $780,000 is still above our minimum of $800,000. We're not desperate to sell and can likely get closer to our desired price.
* **John's Offer is Our Backup:** We have John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net, so we can afford to be a bit more assertive in our negotiations.
* **Opportunity to Push For More:**  We have 4 rounds left and there's still room to negotiate. Bob has demonstrated a willingness to compromise. 

**Next Round:** We'll counter with a price slightly higher than $780,000 but still lower than $800,000, emphasizing the value of the product and the time pressure. We'll also re-emphasize that John is a serious buyer who's waiting in the wings."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. You've already acknowledged its worth at $800,000, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  To be fair to both of us, and to ensure we reach an agreement, let's compromise at $790,000.  Remember, John is also interested in this product, and I'm only a few rounds away from accepting his offer. This is your last chance to secure this valuable asset at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** We're moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above our minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value to Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits and the price he's already acknowledged.
* **Time Pressure & John's Offer:** We subtly introduce a sense of urgency by mentioning the remaining rounds and John's waiting offer. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act. 
* **Fairness:** We highlight the ""fairness"" of our offer, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and mutual benefit.

**Important Note:** With only three rounds left, we're getting closer to John's offer.  We'll need to carefully assess Bob's response and decide whether to accept or reject his counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but $790,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $785,000? This price shows I'm serious about the deal, and I'm willing to make a final concession to get it done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Remain:**  We're getting close to the end, and Bob's offer is still below our minimum.
* **Limited Upside:**  While Bob is willing to compromise, there's limited room for further price increases in just two rounds.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  We have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point.

**Conclusion:**  It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob, where we might end up with a lower price or no deal at all."
