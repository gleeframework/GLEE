Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  It allows for negotiation without scaring Bob away immediately. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You have some flexibility to adjust the price if needed. 

Remember, the key is to be persuasive and keep the negotiation open. You can use Bob's response to guide your next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $150 is your minimum acceptable price, you've already established a higher price point. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price. You can potentially get closer to your initial $200 asking price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget concerns.  How about $175?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $175 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $160 is just $10 below your minimum price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If you reject, you might get a better price, but there's also a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort.  

It's a good strategic decision to accept Bob's offer. You're getting a good price and securing a sale."
