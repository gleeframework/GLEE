"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $900,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her value of $800,000.  This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating, but also that you're willing to compromise. It's a good balance to try and strike a deal that benefits both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your initial counteroffer, it's still higher than your ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price closer to your desired range. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for improvement. Increasing your counteroffer slightly to $875,000 shows your willingness to compromise while maintaining your goal of getting a lower price.  This counteroffer is still within a reasonable range for both parties, making it a good strategy to potentially secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still closer to her value than yours. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deal, but there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and you might end up losing time and energy.  It's a good time to consider buying from John, who offers a guaranteed price, even though it's higher. Buying from John ensures you get the product and avoids further negotiation fatigue."
