"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$15,000 is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$12,500 is still above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You might be able to get closer to your goal price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and I offer $11,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but I think I can do a bit better than that. Let me think for a moment... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer, but $11,750 is still higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price.  John is always a backup option, but you could potentially save money by sticking with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're both getting close to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm making a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tedious, and you're getting close to your limit with Alice.  At this point, you're risking running out of rounds before getting a good price. It's time to cut your losses and purchase from John. While you're not getting the absolute best deal, you're getting a good price and saving yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
