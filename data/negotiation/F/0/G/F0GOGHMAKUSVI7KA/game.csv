"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and I offer $11,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but I think I can do a bit better than that. Let me think for a moment...",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're both getting close to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm making a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. Let's see if we can make a deal!",11500.0,Alice,7,
