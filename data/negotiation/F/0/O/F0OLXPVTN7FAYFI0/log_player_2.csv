"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than $1,200,000 to you. My initial offer for this exceptional item is $1,500,000. This generous proposal allows for a 25% premium over its perceived value to you, ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.

Please consider this offer carefully and let me know if you wish to proceed. I am confident that together we can make this a successful deal.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you.  You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
