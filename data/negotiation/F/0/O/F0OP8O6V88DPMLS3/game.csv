"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure the price is right. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.
