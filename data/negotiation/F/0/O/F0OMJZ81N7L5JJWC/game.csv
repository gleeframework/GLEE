"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $800000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $800000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000, which reflects the product's value to me. This price also gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure I make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $900000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $925000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
