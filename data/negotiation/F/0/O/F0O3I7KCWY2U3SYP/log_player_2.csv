Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $98, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $98 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference?  $101.50 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my $80 limit, and we've been going back and forth for several rounds.  While a compromise might be possible, it's not guaranteed.  It's time to move on and avoid risking further negotiation. John's offer is the safest and most efficient option at this point."
