{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's lower than my minimum target of $800,000. I have 9 more rounds to work with, so there's still time to negotiate a better deal with Bob or to sell to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000.
