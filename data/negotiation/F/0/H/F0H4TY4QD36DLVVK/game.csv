"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see $850,000 to make this work. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000.
