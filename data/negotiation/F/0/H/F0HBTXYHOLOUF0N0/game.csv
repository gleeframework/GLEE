"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product.  I think it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you in your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but my budget is capped at $1,300,000.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a compromise. How about $1,600,000?  This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the returns will be worth it.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
