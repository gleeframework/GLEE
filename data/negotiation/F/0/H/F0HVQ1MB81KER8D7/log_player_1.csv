Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Value gap:**  I'm aiming for a price that is closer to Bob's perceived value, but still significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me a better chance of a deal, while still securing a good profit.
* **John as a safety net:**  The presence of John, willing to pay $800,000, provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.  

I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving us the chance to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $750,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Negotiation power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate and have some leverage. This may incentivize him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer.

I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still significantly above his initial counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm not willing to give away too much.
* **Midpoint approach:**  $875,000 represents a midpoint between my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000).  
* **Value for both parties:**  This price allows for a good profit for me while remaining attractive to Bob, who can still gain a significant value from the product.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair compromise that has a high chance of being accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $725,000 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $800,000. This doesn't make a significant difference in my profit.
* **Limited room for improvement:** Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price significantly higher than $800,000.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob will consume more time and energy without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome.

Selling to John is the most sensible option, as it offers a quick and straightforward transaction with a price that meets my minimum requirement."
