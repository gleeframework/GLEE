"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering its worth to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,000? This would ensure a win-win situation for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9800.0,Bob,6,
