"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. However, it's not too far off, leaving room for negotiation and a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I've lowered it a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit beyond my minimum and prevents risking further negotiation rounds.  I'd rather secure this deal than potentially lose more time and end up selling to John for my minimum."
