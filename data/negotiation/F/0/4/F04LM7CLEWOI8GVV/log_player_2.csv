"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking for a product worth no more than $1,500,000.  Alice's offer is exactly at your limit. There's no incentive to negotiate with her, as you're not likely to get a better price.  John is offering the same price, so you're better off buying from John and avoiding the potential for a lengthy negotiation."
