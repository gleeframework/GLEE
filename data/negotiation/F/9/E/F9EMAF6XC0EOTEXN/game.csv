"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $95. It's a fair compromise, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $95, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $102. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
