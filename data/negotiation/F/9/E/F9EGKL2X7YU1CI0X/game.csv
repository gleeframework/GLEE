"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value this product brings to you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
