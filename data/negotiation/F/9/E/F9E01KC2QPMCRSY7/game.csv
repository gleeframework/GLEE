"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to make sure the price is fair for me as well. I'm happy to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
