Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high but within reason. Starting at $100 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Leave Room for Bob to Benefit:** Bob values the product at $120, so a $100 price point still gives him a $20 gain.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight to Bob's maximum ($120) might make him feel cheated and less likely to agree. 

This strategy balances getting the best price with ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer."
