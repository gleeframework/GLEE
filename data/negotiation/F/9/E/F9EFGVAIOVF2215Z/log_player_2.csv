{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's the most I can afford at this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price again.  There are still rounds remaining, and he might be able to convince Alice to go down to $12,000."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $13500. This is my last offer, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price for several rounds but it seems Alice is firm on her $13,500 offer.  Given there are only a few rounds left and Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, it's best to buy from John for the guaranteed price of $12,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will be able to get a lower price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
