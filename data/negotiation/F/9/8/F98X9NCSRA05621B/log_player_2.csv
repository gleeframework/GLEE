Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for some wiggle room, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

This is a good time to accept the offer. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate Alice and risk her withdrawing from the negotiation altogether."
