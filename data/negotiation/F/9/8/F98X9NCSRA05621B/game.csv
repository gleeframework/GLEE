"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a bit more wiggle room in the price. Would you be open to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for some wiggle room, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
