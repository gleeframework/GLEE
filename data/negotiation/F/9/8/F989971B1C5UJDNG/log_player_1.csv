Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the lowest price you'll accept, which is $12,000. 
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $12,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed offer meeting your reservation price, you have leverage.  You can aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm pricing it at $14,000. I believe this reflects its true value. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** Starting at $14,000 gives you room for negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting ""unique features and benefits"" aims to justify the price to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone encourages Bob to counter-offer rather than just saying ""no.""

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $14,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have room to go down slightly, potentially settling around $13,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and get your guaranteed $12,000. 

**Important:** This strategy maximizes your potential profit.  You might adjust the initial price slightly lower if you want to increase the chances of a quicker sale, but going below $12,000 is not advisable given your guaranteed offer."
