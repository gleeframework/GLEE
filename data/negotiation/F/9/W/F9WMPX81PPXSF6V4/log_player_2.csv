{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Alice for several rounds and we're still quite far apart. It's getting late in the game, and I'm concerned that if I reject her offer again, she might walk away.  I'm running out of time, and I'm worried that I won't be able to close a deal at all.  To avoid that risk, I'm going to take John's offer and buy the product from him for $800,000. While it's not the best possible price, it's a safe bet and ensures I get the product."
