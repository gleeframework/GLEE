"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value for both parties. Given its significance and the unique benefits it offers, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This figure encapsulates the product's true worth while allowing for a fair negotiation. I believe this proposal strikes a balance between maximizing the return on my investment and providing you with an attractive offer. I look forward to discussing this further and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still quite high. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to come back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000. Even if she doesn't budge, you have John as a backup option at $1,000,000."
