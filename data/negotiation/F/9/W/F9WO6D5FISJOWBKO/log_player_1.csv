I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will find this offer attractive, as it's still above the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $14,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $10,000. I'm hoping he'll find this price more reasonable, as it's still above the value he places on the product."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that we're far apart on the value of this product.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
