Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part and a very attractive offer for you. I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing a good return on your investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your preferred price, $975,000 is still over your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get the price down even further. You still have a few rounds left and there's a chance you can reach a deal that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $975,000 is a much better offer. However, I'm still working with a tight budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's settle this right now at $962,500.  This is my final offer, as it splits the difference between our previous positions.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $962,500 is still above your budget of $800,000.  You've negotiated for several rounds and have made significant progress, but it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down any further. It's now more beneficial to secure the product from John at a price that fits within your budget, rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether by continuing negotiations with Alice."
