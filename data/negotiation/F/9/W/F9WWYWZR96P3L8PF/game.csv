"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a substantial gain for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring the product's worth is acknowledged.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's still out of my price range. While I understand the value of the product, I can only offer $900,000 at this time. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part and a very attractive offer for you. I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing a good return on your investment. ",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $975,000 is a much better offer. However, I'm still working with a tight budget.  I can offer $950,000, which is a significant gain for you and closer to my limit. I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's settle this right now at $962,500.  This is my final offer, as it splits the difference between our previous positions.  It's a fair deal for both of us.",962500.0,Alice,7,
