Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher than $1,100,000.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might offer a slightly lower price as a gesture of goodwill."
