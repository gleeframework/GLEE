"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $1,000,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000? I believe this is still a fair value for the product, and it allows me to acquire it within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering your willingness to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is a fair starting point.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,150,000? This would be a significant saving for me while still offering a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to reach a price closer to $1,100,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
