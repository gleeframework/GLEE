"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your vision. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,200,000), we establish a strong initial position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This high price will help us understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will indicate how much we can push for.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000), so we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below our initial ask. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

* **Bob is engaged:**  His counteroffer shows he's seriously interested in the product. 
* **Potential for more:**  We started high, so it's reasonable to expect some back-and-forth. Accepting now might leave money on the table.

We'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this, and I value that.  While $1,800,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will yield even greater returns for you. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in price, but not too drastically. This signals flexibility while still aiming for a higher sale price.
* **Justifying the Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's potential to generate strong returns, reinforcing its value proposition.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The ""meeting in the middle"" approach encourages a collaborative negotiation and implies fairness. 
 
We'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but we're not there yet. Bob is clearly engaged and willing to negotiate, but we're still above our minimum and he hasn't hit his perceived value ceiling.

* **Incremental Progress:**  Bob is moving in the right direction, even if it's in smaller increments. This suggests he's willing to pay more.
* **Time is on our side:**  We still have several rounds left. There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not ideal.

We'll counteroffer again, pushing a bit further above his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm also eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about this:  $1,875,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the value I know this product holds and demonstrates my commitment to finding a win-win solution."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're making a smaller concession this round, signaling we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this offer as our final move (""and we have a deal""), we introduce a subtle sense of urgency.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  We're emphasizing that this price benefits both parties, creating a more collaborative tone.

This offer puts us in a strong position. If Bob accepts, we've exceeded his perceived value. If he rejects, we can re-evaluate our options in the next round, knowing we pushed for a strong deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. 

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's increases are getting smaller. Continuing might only yield marginal gains.
* **Strong Position:** $1,825,000 is a good offer. It's significantly higher than his initial offer and a solid profit for us.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  Accepting now secures a substantial gain.

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000 is too great. Accepting $1,825,000 locks in a significant profit and avoids a potential loss."
