"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, $16,000 is still outside of his ideal range. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. He can still potentially get a better deal with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to go slightly above my initial offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. He has two rounds left, and Alice's offer of $14,250 is still above his ideal price range.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed $12,000 price with John than risk not reaching an agreement with Alice and being forced to buy at a higher price."
