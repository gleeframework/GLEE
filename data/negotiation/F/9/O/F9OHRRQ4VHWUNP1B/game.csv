"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but I'm only able to spend $12,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is considerably lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? Would $15,000 work for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. How about $13,000? That would be a good middle ground for us both.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can spend.  If we can agree on $13,500, I'm ready to make a deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,6,
