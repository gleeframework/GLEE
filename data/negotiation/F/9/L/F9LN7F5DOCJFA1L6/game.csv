"I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $2,200,000 represents a significant discount on the true value and potential this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
