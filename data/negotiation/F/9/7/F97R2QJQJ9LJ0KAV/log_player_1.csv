"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value of the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my goal through counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum price of $800,000 and is a good deal considering we're already in round 4. It's also close to my counter-offer of $900,000, suggesting he's willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
