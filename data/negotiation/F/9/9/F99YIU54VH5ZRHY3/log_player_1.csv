"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer. I'm also trying to create a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering its value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm countering with a price of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm highlighting the value of the product and making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.  This should encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Although it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $92 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $96.  This is the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $96, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm emphasizing flexibility and making it clear that this is my final offer. This should encourage Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $96 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $94? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiations with Bob.  There's a good chance that we won't be able to agree on a price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John."
