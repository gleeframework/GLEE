"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,087,500. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
