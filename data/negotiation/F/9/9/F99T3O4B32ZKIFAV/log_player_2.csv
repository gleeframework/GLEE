Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
