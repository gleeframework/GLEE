Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, as it's still a great value to me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and it's still worth more to me to keep negotiating with him. I will make a counter offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $12,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'll accept his offer."
