"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $11,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for compromise.  Let's see what Alice's response is!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still not a good deal. You have more leverage to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This is a reasonable counter-offer, as it's closer to Alice's most recent price but still lower than her last offer. It's a good strategy to show that you are serious about buying the product but are still willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Alice is not budging much, accepting her offer at $11,600 is still a good deal. It's lower than the price from John and you've saved $400 compared to Alice's initial offer."
