"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can potentially save money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to what I know the product is worth to me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still more than what you initially offered.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still within your budget and represents a compromise.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John for $800,000 outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation.  Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of additional rounds."
