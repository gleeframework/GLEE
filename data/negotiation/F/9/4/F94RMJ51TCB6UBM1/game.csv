"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That way, we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there. How about $10,750? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",10875.0,Alice,5,
