{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle to secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to explore lower prices. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $9,250. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Alice, and we can finally reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're only halfway through the negotiation rounds. While I could continue to negotiate, I risk not closing a deal before the 10 rounds are up. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
