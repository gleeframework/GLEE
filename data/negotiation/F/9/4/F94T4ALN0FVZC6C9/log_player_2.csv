"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, you can likely do better. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $9,500 but still above her value of $8,000. This should open the door for further negotiation without immediately alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal, considering:

* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay $10,000.
* **Alice's minimum:** She's willing to sell for $8,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has already lowered her price from $9,500.

Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John and is a fair compromise. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions from Alice, but it's also risky.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you could end up paying more or losing the deal entirely."
