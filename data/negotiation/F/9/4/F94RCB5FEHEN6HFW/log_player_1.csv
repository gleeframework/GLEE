Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $80.  I'm hoping to get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I've already come down from my initial price.  $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $81? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 81} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm worried that we're going to run out of rounds before we can reach an agreement.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all."
