Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I frame the offer as a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting the value he'll get.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with a ""take it or leave it"" offer, allowing for a back-and-forth. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your price and the market price I know from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my minimum ($8,000), it's still below the value I place on the product. 
* **Opportunity for a higher price:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the price's fairness.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum of $8,000, so it's a good compromise while remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your new offer and my original offer, which would be $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $9,000 is very close to my initial offer of $10,000 and well above my minimum of $8,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with John's offer of $8,000. 
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting now allows me to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds."
