Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the product's value to him. If he rejects, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is getting drawn out. I'm confident John will buy it for $80, so I'm going to cut my losses and sell to him."
