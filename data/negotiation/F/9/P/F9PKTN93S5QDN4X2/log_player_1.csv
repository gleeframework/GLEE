"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation at a favorable point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit margin for me and hopefully will be more attractive to Bob. I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to a price that reflects the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable range.  I'll counteroffer in the next round.  Selling to John right now would be a safe option, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm making a small concession, lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
