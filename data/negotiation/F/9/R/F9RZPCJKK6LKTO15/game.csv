"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000? This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $12,500. I really like the product, but I need to stick to my budget. If we can't meet at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000.",12500.0,Bob,6,
