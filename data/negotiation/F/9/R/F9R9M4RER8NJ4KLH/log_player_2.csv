Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $5,000 is quite low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're ready to make a decision!

Explanation:  While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $9,000 is still more than John's $8,000 price. It makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
