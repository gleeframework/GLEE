"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. $16,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $6,000 is quite low. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still way above my budget. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's my maximum budget for this product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm going straight to my ideal price point.  This lets Alice know exactly where I stand and leaves no room for interpretation.  She may accept, counter, or reject. However, I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if necessary."
