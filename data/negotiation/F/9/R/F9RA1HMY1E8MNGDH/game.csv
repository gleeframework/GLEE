"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you consider something around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
