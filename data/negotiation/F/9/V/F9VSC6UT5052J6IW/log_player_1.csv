Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. While $130 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about $135?  Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is my final offer before I move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $122 is only slightly better, but with limited rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale."
