"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still too close to your maximum price.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to profit, and it's a price I believe is fair considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is aggressive but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, focusing on the value to Bob and leaving room for a win-win scenario.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, showing a willingness to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is closer to your desired price point.
* **Potential for Savings:** While you could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,200,000 is too high.  
* **Profitable Deal:** Even at $850,000, you are still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
