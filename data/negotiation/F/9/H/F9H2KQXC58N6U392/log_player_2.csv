Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's well above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll reject and attempt to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
