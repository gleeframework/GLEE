"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and still allows me to make a good profit.  I believe this price is attractive enough to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial valuation of $800,000, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is another compromise, coming closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, but this offer shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm starting to worry about running out of time. We're down to only 4 rounds, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price with him.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him now and avoid the risk of losing out on a good deal."
