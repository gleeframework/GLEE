"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $500000 is significantly below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile. I propose a counteroffer of $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is still far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1200000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for some negotiation room. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to come up on your offer.  While $1050000 is closer to where we need to be, it's still not quite enough to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $1125000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1125000.0,Alice,7,
