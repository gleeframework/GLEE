{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $112 is still above my minimum of $120.  It's a good deal for me, and it seems like we're close to a final agreement."
