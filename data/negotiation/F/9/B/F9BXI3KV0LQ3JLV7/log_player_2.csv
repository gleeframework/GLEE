"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still too high, and he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above his budget.  He can counter-offer again, or, if he feels he's not going to get a better deal from Alice, move on to John."
