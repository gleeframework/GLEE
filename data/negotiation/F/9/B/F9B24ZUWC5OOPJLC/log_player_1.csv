"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation while still leaving me a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think $90 would be a fair price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's closer to my initial offer. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
