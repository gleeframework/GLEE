"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
