"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This price is fair considering the product's worth and potential benefits for your business. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is significantly below my minimum asking price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $12,000. This price still allows you to benefit from the product's value while being fair for me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
