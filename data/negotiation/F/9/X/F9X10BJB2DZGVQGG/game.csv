"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This price is fair considering your value for it is $800,000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering $800,000, which is exactly your value for the product.  This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
