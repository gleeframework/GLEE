Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, but I still need to make a bit more than that.

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $80.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
