{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price, allowing for potential negotiation. It also highlights the value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer, but I'm still not able to go above $95 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to negotiate any further. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $150."
