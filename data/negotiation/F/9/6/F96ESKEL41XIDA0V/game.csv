"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $7500.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my limit of $12000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your serious offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm thinking of $7800. I've done some research and I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. I'm getting close to the limit of what I'm willing to spend, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",7800.0,Bob,6,
