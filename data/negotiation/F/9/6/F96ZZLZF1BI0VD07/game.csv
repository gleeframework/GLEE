"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm on a tight budget, and that's the most I can afford.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my expenses.  Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",95.0,Bob,4,
