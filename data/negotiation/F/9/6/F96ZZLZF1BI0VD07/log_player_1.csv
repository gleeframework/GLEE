{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm on a tight budget, and that's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle for it right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $115.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my expenses.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's final offer of $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to take a loss on this product, so selling it to John for $100 is the best option."
