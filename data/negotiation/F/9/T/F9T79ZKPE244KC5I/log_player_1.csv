Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Bob that you are serious about selling and willing to be flexible.  

Here's why this strategy is good:

* **Starts high:**  It leaves room for negotiation without giving away too much value.
* **Shows willingness to deal:** It establishes a starting point for the negotiation.
* **Keeps the option open for John:** You can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through.

Let me know how the negotiation progresses, and I can help you make the best decisions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it leaves you with a healthy profit and provides me with a significant savings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered and what you believe the product is worth. You should reject this offer and see if you can negotiate a higher price.  You have a good chance of getting a better deal than $850,000, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  

Let's continue negotiating with Bob. What counteroffer would you like to make?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still maintaining a substantial profit. Here's why it's a good choice:

* **Meets in the middle:** It offers a price that's closer to Bob's offer, making it more appealing.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** It shows that you're interested in reaching an agreement.
* **Maintains profit:** $900,000 is still a strong price for you, as it's well above your minimum.

Let me know Bob's response, and we'll work together to make the best possible deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a fair compromise. While it's still lower than your initial target, it's closer to your minimum price of $800,000.  It's a good idea to accept this offer as it allows you to make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away completely. 

While you could continue to negotiate and try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee of success. You have a potential buyer who is willing to pay a reasonable amount, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing that sale."
