Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leave Bob Room to Negotiate:** By offering it at $120, we give Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest. If he flat-out rejects it, we know he might be very price-sensitive. 

**Important Note:** We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $80.  We should keep this in mind as Bob and I negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $70 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below our minimum acceptable price of $80. While his message suggests some flexibility, we have a better alternative with John. We'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're on a budget, Bob.  However, $70 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** We significantly reduce our asking price to show flexibility, but we don't go all the way to the middle point between our original offer and his ($90). This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Strong but Flexible Language:** We acknowledge his budget concerns but reiterate that his offer was too low. By suggesting a specific price (""meet me halfway""), we provide a clear target for Bob to consider.
* **Maintain John as a Backup:**  We're still aiming higher than $80, knowing John provides a guaranteed sale at that price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $80. While we could potentially push for a bit more in another round, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting the $85 offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
