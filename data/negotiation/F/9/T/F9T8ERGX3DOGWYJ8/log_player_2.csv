{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can do better by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially attractive to her, as it's above her floor price. This will give us room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still willing to push for a lower price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my ideal price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying within my budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to overpay. This counteroffer should push Alice closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $10,000 is closer to my target price than previous offers, it's still above my maximum budget. I've made a couple of counteroffers and haven't been able to reach a deal with Alice. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000, which guarantees I get the product within my budget."
