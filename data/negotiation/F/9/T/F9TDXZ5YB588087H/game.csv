"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to offer $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, and I have other interested buyers to consider. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and would allow you to make a decent profit.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1100000, which would be $1175000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it has to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,7,
