"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal soon.",10125.0,Alice,5,
