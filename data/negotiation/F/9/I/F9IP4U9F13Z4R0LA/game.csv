"Hi Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
