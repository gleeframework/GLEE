"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. How about we meet at $112? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise.",112.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product.",108.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. I'm already sacrificing my profit margin, and I need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
