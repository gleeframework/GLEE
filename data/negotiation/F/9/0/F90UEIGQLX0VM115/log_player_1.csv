Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This makes you appear reasonable and open to discussion.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, there's still room for improvement. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more by rejecting Bob's counteroffer and making my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get the product, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'd like to see $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly.
* **Strong justification:** I'm giving a clear reason for my counteroffer, focusing on the value to Bob.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing my desire to reach a deal, which makes me seem more agreeable.

Let's see if this gets us closer to a deal!"

# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price that balances both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200.
