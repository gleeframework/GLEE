"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring his perception of the product's value. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value without revealing specific details.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting significantly above both our valuations, I aim to create a negotiation space where we can hopefully meet closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I started high to gauge his flexibility, and his counteroffer shows he's serious but also leaves room for me to negotiate upwards. I'm confident I can still get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize you see the value in this product, my initial assessment of its worth remains firm. Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate while reiterating the product's value. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down in price, but not drastically. This signals flexibility on my end while still aiming for a high price. 
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise that is significantly above my minimum and still below Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. Can we find a mutually agreeable price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,500,000 represents a $500,000 profit, which is significant. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle signals that this is likely close to his maximum price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging negotiations further risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
