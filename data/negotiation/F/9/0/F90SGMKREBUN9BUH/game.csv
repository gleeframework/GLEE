"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
