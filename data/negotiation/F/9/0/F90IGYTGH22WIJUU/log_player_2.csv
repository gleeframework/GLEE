"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and its benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the chance to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is $25,000 above your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge below $1,050,000. This is within Bob's budget, but John offers a better deal at $1,000,000.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and save $50,000."
