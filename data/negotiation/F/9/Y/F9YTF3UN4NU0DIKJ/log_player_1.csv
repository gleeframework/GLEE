"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but I'm also mindful of the limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like a little more, we're nearing the middle ground and accepting now avoids risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal altogether.  $13,000 is a good profit considering my minimum."
