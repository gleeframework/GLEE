I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $10,250."
