"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product without stating my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and try to determine his maximum price. 
* I'll be prepared to make counteroffers if needed, but will be cautious not to go too low too quickly.
* If the negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to $10,000 by making a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but I'm confident that with smart negotiation, I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $9,000 and $10,000. 
* I will emphasize the value of the product and try to understand Bob's budget constraints better. 
* I'll be prepared to make further counteroffers if needed."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above his initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.

Round 4
