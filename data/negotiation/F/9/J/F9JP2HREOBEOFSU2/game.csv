"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest and willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This is a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
