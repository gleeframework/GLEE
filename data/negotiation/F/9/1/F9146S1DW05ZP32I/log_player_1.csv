{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my valuation of $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so $12,000 is a good starting point for a compromise. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $10,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still far below my minimum valuation of $15,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11250}
