Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000. I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be honest,  $11,000 is the highest I can go. If that's not workable for you, I understand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $11,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a significant compromise on my end, but I value finding common ground."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a compromise.  While $15,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John for that amount, so it's no longer strategically wise to continue negotiating with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
