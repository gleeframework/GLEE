Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I believe I can do better.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $105 is still a decent profit for me.  It's getting close to the price John is willing to pay, so I don't want to risk losing the deal."
