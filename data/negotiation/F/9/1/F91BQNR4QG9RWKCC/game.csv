"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm more comfortable in the range of $6,000. Would you be open to that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a lower price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer with a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
