"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if $2,000,000 is a good value for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,750,000 reflects that more accurately. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and shows my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, so I'd like to see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
