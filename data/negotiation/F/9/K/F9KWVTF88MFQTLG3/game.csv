"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $9,750?  This price reflects the value of the product, and it's the most I can reasonably offer.  Let's find a way to make this work.",9750.0,Bob,6,
