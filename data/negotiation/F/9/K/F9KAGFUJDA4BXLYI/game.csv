"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $85 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $75 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $80 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $75. Let's split the difference at $77.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",77.5,Bob,4,
