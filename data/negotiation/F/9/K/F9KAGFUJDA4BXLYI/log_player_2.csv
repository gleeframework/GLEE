"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth a lot to us, but we're willing to let it go for $85. We believe this is a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $100.  You're in a strong position because you have John as a backup option. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $85 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $75 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $80 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still above your desired $100.  You have John as a backup, so there's no need to rush.  You can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $80 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $75. Let's split the difference at $77.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your proposal. Considering your interest, I am willing to offer the product for $79. Can we agree on this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $79 is now within your target price range. While you might be able to squeeze out a few dollars more, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. It's time to close the deal and avoid any further risk of Alice walking away or you needing to buy from John at a higher price."
