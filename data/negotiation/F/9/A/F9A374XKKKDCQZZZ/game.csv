"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we both have a bottom line here. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? It's a fair offer that saves us both time and gets the deal done.",825000.0,Bob,4,
