"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $9,500.  If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
