"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and it allows us to both make a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $850000 is still a bit below my target price. Considering the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.
