Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still higher than my minimum price of $150. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $155. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to buy the product without having to resort to selling it to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum price of $150, and I'm not sure how much higher I can get him to go.  It's also likely that further negotiation will just prolong the process and potentially lead to a lower offer. I'll take the $152 to avoid further risk and ensure a sale."
