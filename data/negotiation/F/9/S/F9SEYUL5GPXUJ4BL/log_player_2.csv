"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer from John. While it's not ideal to pay the full $1,500,000, it's a better deal than accepting Alice's $1,200,000 offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for further negotiation, potentially bringing the price down closer to Alice's $1,000,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about purchasing the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is now lower than the price John is selling the product for. It's still above Alice's minimum value, so she is likely motivated to make a deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget while still saving money compared to buying from John."
