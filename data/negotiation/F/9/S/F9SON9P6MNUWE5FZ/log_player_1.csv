{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a significant return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a significant discount:** $1,000,000 is still a substantial profit for you and a good deal for Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's enough room for Bob to make a counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept immediately.
* **It's not too low:**  You don't want to risk underselling yourself too early on.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  Keep in mind that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so you don't want to settle for significantly less.  You can adjust your offers and counteroffers as the negotiation progresses, based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, which is a significant discount from your original offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You can likely get closer to your desired price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to send a counteroffer and see if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to come down from your original offer, indicating you're serious about making a deal.
* **Is still above your minimum:**  $900,000 is closer to your desired price than Bob's offer. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's still room to negotiate without significantly reducing your profit margin. 

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so you're not under pressure to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $850,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum.  There's no need to settle for less.

You can reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and push him closer to your desired price.  You could also counter with a slightly lower price to keep the negotiation moving.  However, always remember that you can walk away at any time and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement so we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued negotiation:** You are willing to compromise further, but still maintaining a profitable price for yourself.
* **Is close to your minimum:**  $875,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, but still a decent deal for Bob.
* **Leaves room for final compromise:** It allows for a potential final compromise if Bob is truly unwilling to go higher.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so you're in a strong position to secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, you've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and his offers are still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your desired price.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob, especially since his latest offer is still too low.  

Selling to John ensures you get the best possible price for your product, securing a significant profit."
