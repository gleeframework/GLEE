Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price higher than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you aim to create a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 

**It's important to note:** This is just an opening offer.  You are prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob and sell to John if necessary."
