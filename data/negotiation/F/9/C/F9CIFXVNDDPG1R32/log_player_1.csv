Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure the Deal:** We don't want to price it too high and risk Bob rejecting the offer, forcing us to settle for John's lower price.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of having a backup buyer."
