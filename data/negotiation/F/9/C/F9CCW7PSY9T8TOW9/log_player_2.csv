Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8500? This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it still represents excellent value for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still above your ideal price point.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to push the price down further."
