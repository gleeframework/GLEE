Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $3,500. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that still provides significant value to Bob (a $3,500 gain for him). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly."
