"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $140, which is a compromise. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $140. I can do $130, which is a good compromise. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
