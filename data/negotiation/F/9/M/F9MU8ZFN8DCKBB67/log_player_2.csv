Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still a bit away from what I'd like to get for the product. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and it's not worth risking her rejecting the offer and potentially losing the product entirely. You can get it for a guaranteed $120 from John."
