Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a price significantly above your baseline.
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price without context is less effective. By mentioning the product's value and what Bob stands to gain, you're providing justification for the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is important. By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to engage in a discussion and potentially negotiate, making a ""yes"" more likely.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing. If you absolutely cannot go below $15,000, you might adjust the message to be firmer.
* Observe Bob's reaction. If he seems completely turned off by the price, be prepared to adjust your approach in further communication."
