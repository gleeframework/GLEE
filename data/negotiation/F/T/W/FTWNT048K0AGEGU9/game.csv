"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While $100 is my minimum, I can't accept that just yet.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can still reach a compromise. Would it be possible to lower the price to $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $112.50? That way we're both closer to what we want.",112.5,Alice,5,
