"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I believe I can only agree to a price that reflects its true worth to me. Given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $9,500 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's try to find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round, as time is moving forward.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in negotiating. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am prepared to offer $11,000 for it. This price is higher than my initial offer and closer to your last proposal. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",11000.0,Bob,6,
