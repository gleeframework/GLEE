"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm offering $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects both the product's value to you and my need to make a profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still not a feasible price for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. This is my final offer. If you're not able to accept, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
