Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to consider it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, however, and I believe $1500000 is a fair price that accounts for both our needs. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,500,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point and appreciate your continued interest. While I believe the product's worth is higher, I'm ready to make a final concession.  $1450000 reflects a fair value for both of us. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
