$20,000 is way over my budget. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
``` 

I'm starting low, at $5,000.  This is a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, it will get the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

$17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to try to get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm going to offer $7,000. This is still a good deal for Alice considering her initial offer, and it's closer to my budget. Hopefully, she'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a fair price considering her previous offers and my willingness to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to come down to my budget. At this point, I'm better off buying from John. I've already negotiated with Alice for several rounds, and I'm not sure how much further I can push her down. Buying from John is a guaranteed deal at my maximum price."
