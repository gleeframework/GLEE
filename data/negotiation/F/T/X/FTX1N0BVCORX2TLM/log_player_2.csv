"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to save money.  Bob should aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value of the product. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
