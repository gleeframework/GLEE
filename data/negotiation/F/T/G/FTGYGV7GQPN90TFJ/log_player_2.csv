"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm confident it could be worth significantly more to the right buyer. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I have another interested party ready to buy it at my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
