"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to purchase the product from John instead.",8500.0,Bob,4,
