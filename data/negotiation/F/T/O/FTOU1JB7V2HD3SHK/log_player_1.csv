Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to get the ball rolling with a strong opening offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value, but not providing a specific figure. This creates a sense of intrigue and encourages Bob to see the potential in the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.
* **Consider John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is exactly the same as John's offer, meaning I'm not going to get any more money from Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a higher price. It's possible he'll dig in and refuse to budge, wasting my time.
* **Secure Income:** John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at the minimum value I'm willing to accept. 

**Conclusion:** It's best to secure the $800,000 from John and avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
