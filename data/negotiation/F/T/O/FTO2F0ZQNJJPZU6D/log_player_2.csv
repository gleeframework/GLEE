"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $13,000 from John. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you. You're getting the product for $3,000 less than John's price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you a lower price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
