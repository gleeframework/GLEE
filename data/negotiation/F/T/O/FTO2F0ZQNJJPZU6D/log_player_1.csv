Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's offers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
