,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm excited to see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
