"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,750,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are 10 rounds, so there is plenty of time to try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,650,000 is still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there is time for further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,600,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,625,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,625,000 is closer to his target, it's still above his maximum value. With several rounds remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,625,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with my original offer of $1,600,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
