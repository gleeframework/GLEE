"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80 to anyone. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's only fair that you should pay a bit more than its intrinsic value. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This way, you're getting a great deal compared to its market value, and I'm ensuring a fair return for my effort in sourcing and providing this product to you. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $150. While her sales pitch emphasizes value, you have a viable alternative in John, who is offering the product at your maximum price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John at your set limit."
