"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $80 to anyone. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's only fair that you should pay a bit more than its intrinsic value. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This way, you're getting a great deal compared to its market value, and I'm ensuring a fair return for my effort in sourcing and providing this product to you. I look forward to your positive response.",120.0,Alice,1,
