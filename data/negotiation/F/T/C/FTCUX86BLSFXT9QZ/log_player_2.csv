"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  I think it would be incredibly useful for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I believe this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer again and he'd be left paying John's higher price.
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continued negotiation.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this scenario."
