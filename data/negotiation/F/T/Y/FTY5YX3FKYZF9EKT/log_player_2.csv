"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than Alice's original asking price, you can still get the product for cheaper.  You're willing to pay up to $80, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $80 for this product, so offering $80 is the best possible counteroffer. This gives you the best chance of closing the deal without exceeding your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $90, which is still higher than your maximum budget of $80.  Since you can purchase the product from John for $80, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  You'll save $10 by buying from John."
