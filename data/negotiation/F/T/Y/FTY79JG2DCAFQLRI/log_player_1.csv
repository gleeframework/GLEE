Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. However, I'm not giving away too much, as I know John is willing to pay the full value."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm going to try to get closer to my target of $1,750,000. I'll counter his offer and see if he's willing to budge."
