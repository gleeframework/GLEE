"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to maximize my profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum value, it's still too high. You have 10 rounds and the opportunity to counteroffer, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to both of us, and allows for a decent profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a significant profit for you, while allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still above your desired price. You still have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's reach an agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,340,000, which is only $40,000 above your most recent counteroffer and well below your maximum value.  While you could continue to negotiate, there is a risk of Alice walking away and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice at this point, securing the product at a decent price."
