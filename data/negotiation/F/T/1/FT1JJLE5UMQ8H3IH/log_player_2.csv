"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $750,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save more.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a quick deal at a lower price. I'm hoping Alice is motivated to sell and will consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, and I'm now $75,000 below my maximum. While I could try to push for a lower price, the risk of her rejecting further offers and me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
