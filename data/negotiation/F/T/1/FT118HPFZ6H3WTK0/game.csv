"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to find a workable agreement, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is substantial, and I need to ensure a fair deal.  Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are continuing to make progress. $875,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. To be upfront, I have an alternative option at $800,000.  If you could meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
