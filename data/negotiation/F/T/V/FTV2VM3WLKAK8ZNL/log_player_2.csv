"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my value and your need to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,300,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding firm at a price higher than Bob's maximum. While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's risky to continue negotiating.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially failing."
