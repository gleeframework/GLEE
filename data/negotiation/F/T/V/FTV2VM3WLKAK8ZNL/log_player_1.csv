"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness Argument:**  Mentioning ""fairness"" can help build trust and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussion and not just making a hard sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my value and your need to sell. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Value for Time:** Even though John is willing to pay my full price, I have 10 rounds to potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price but not by much. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value Bob will get. 
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Time to Counter:**  I have time left in the negotiation. I can try to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Value for Time:**  Even though John offers my full price, there's still a chance to get closer to it with Bob. I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than what John offers yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,300,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This approach is often seen as fair by both parties, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increment:** I'm only asking for a small increase to test if Bob is willing to go a bit higher. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""good outcome"" for both parties, encouraging Bob to see the value in agreeing."
