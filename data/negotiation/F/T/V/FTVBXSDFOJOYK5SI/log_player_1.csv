Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with an offer closer to my minimum ($1,500,000) gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and suggesting further discussion, I signal openness to negotiation without directly underselling the product.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price Bob deems acceptable while staying above his perceived value. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate down slightly, knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
