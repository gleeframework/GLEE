Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even though John's offer is lower) could encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
