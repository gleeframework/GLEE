Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll see if I can get him closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $950,000. This product is truly valuable and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's keep the negotiation going! "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is tempting, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. It's still a bit too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can push Bob a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still looking for $940,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $915,000 is almost there, I'm going to reject this offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $940,000 before considering selling to John. There are still a few rounds left, and I think I can push Bob a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We've reached a point where Bob and I are not close enough on price.  It's clear we're unlikely to come to an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal. John's offer is much closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that this is the best decision for me."
