"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This price allows us both to make a deal and I can move forward with the purchase.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. As the original seller, I'm looking to make a profit, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
