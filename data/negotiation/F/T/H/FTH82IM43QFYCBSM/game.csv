"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I can do $110, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $95? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from $95. I can do $105, which is the next best I can offer. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I can meet you halfway between $105 and $98, so I'll offer you $101.50. Let me know if that's a sweet spot for you.",101.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I think I can do better than $101.50. Can you meet me at $99? I'm willing to make a final push to get the price I want.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final push, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $102. I think that's the minimum I can do to make this deal work for me. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",102.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $97. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to pass and look elsewhere.",97.0,Bob,10,
