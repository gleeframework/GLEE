"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a special price of $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to me, and you value it at $8,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $9,500."
