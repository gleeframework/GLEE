```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,500.
*  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, achieving his goal of saving money."
