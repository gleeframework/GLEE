"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $98 is more than John's offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, there's a high chance Bob will reject my counteroffer and we'll be back at square one. Accepting $95 ensures a decent profit, and we're already at round 6 with only 4 rounds left.  It's a good compromise."
