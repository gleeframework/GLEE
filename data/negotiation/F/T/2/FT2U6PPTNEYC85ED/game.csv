"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $16,000 is still above my limit.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm thinking $17,000 is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
