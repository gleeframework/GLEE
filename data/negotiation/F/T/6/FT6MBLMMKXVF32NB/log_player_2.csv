"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for a price of $1500000. It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it holds immense value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, you have no room to negotiate.  It's better to buy from John, who you know is willing to sell at that price, rather than risk Alice rejecting a counteroffer."
