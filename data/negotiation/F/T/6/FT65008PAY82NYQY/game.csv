"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a little too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That's a fair offer reflecting the product's worth.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
