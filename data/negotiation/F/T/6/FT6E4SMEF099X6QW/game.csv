"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I need to get a fair price for it. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
