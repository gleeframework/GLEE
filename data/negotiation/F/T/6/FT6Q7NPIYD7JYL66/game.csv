"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
