Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit."
