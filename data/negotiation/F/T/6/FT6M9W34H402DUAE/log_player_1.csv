"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to my ideal price point. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob to make the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to foster a cooperative negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly.
* **Consider John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become too unfavorable, I can always pivot to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to its true value. How about $900000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob's counteroffer is significantly higher than John's offer. While it's below my ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. It also gives me the opportunity to counter with a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with an offer closer to $1,000,000, aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Negotiation:** I will remain flexible and be willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds.
* **Monitoring John's Offer:** While I'm confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal with Bob, I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Value:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring I gain more than the minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone emphasizes my desire to reach an agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:**  If Bob accepts, excellent! If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest in further negotiation based on his counteroffer.
* **Adapt Approach:** If necessary, I'll adjust my strategy to either push for a higher price or consider lowering the price to secure a deal quickly.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a safety net, ready to switch if needed."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still aiming for a price that's fair for both of us.  How about $925000? That's a significant reduction from your last offer, and it allows you to make a good profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding the Line:**  While Bob's offer is enticing, it's still below my target price. There's a chance I can secure a better deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to ensure I get the best possible price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob I'm not desperate for a quick sale. It gives me leverage for the next counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with an offer slightly higher than $925,000, aiming for a midpoint between our current positions.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'll keep in mind the remaining rounds and be more willing to compromise if necessary, but I won't settle for a price I'm uncomfortable with.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a fallback option. If the negotiations with Bob stall or reach an impasse, I may switch to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $937,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Offer:** I'm offering a price exactly in between our current offers. This shows flexibility and demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly emphasizes the need for a quick decision, adding a bit of pressure without being aggressive.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Response:** If Bob accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll need to decide if further negotiation is worthwhile or if I should move towards John's offer. 
* **Assess Time:** With 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is increasing.  I'll need to be more flexible and consider John's offer more seriously if negotiations with Bob stall.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a fallback option, ready to pivot if necessary to secure a sale."
