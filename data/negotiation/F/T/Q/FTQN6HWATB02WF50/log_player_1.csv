Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than my budget allows.  Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $900000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
