"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than my budget allows.  Given the potential of this product, I'm willing to pay $900000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me to accept at this time. Given the product's unique qualities and the value it represents, I believe $1000000 would be a fair compromise. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
