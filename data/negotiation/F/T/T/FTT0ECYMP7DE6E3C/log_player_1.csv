Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my goal price.  While I'd love to get more, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. It's a good deal for me."
