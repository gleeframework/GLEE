"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $1,125,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,187,500. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
