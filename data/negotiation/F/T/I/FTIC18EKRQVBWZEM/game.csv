"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $18000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $18000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer at $22000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'd like to counteroffer at $21000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",21000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'd like to counteroffer at $20500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",20500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to try to get a deal done. I'd like to counteroffer at $20000. This is my final concession, and I really think this is the lowest price I can accept for the product.",20000.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go above $19500. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but if not, I'll have to explore other options. Is $19500 acceptable to you?",19500.0,Bob,10,
