"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her initial valuation. It's best to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we bring the price down significantly?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but she's still very far from your ideal price. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer you $7,000. That's a fair offer, considering the market value and my own limitations."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $10,000. You've made a reasonable offer at $7,000, and there's a good chance she'll come down further if you hold firm. You're still better off negotiating than accepting her current offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have a strict budget. I can increase my offer slightly to $7,500, but that's the absolute maximum I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  You've made a good effort to negotiate and increased your offer, but it's time to cut your losses. John's offer of $8,000 is a much better deal at this point."
