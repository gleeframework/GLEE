Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I want to try to get a higher price than $11,000.  Since Bob is willing to negotiate, it seems like he is interested in the product, and I may be able to reach a price that is more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $12,000. How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $11,500 is a good deal.  I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, and there's a risk he might lose interest or I could end up having to sell to John for a lower price."
