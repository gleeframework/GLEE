Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for my product just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $108. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to haggle further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting at $108 gets me the product at a significant discount from John's $150 price.  It's not worth risking losing the deal at this point."
