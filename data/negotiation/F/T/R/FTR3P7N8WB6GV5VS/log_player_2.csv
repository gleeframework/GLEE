"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know you're interested in this kind of thing, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I'm only offering it at this price because I believe in your potential. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than you need to pay. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price. If her next offer is still above $15,000, you can always buy from John as a backup."
