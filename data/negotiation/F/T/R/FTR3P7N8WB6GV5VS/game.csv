"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know you're interested in this kind of thing, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I'm only offering it at this price because I believe in your potential.
