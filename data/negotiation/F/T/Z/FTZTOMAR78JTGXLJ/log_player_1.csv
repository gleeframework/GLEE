# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. While I'd love to close the deal with Bob, we've reached a stalemate, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he'll walk away completely. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing out altogether."
