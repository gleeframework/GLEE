"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's price of $125 is lower than John's price of $150.
* **You're getting a good deal:**  Even though the product is worth $150 to you, you're getting it for $125, which is a significant saving."
