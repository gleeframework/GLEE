"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature and your potential gain from it, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $1,300,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the significant value you'll gain. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
