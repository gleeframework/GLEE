"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, is priced at $950,000. Given its worth to you, I believe this offer strikes a balance between fairness and profitability. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000). Bob can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, even though it's the most expensive option."
