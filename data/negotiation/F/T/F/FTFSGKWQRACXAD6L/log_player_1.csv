{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob might encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends with an open invitation to discuss the price, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to initiate a dialogue and gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better price:**  I'm willing to negotiate further. Bob's interest suggests he values the product and might be willing to pay more.
* **Avoiding a ""quick sell"":** Selling to John for $10,000 would be quick and guaranteed, but I believe I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're interested.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,500 to make this work for me.  This would still represent a good value for you, and I'm confident the product will deliver significant benefit.  What are your thoughts on this?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential benefit to him. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting his offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Open to discussion:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer and significantly closer to my ideal price than John's offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  The negotiation has been lengthy, and there's a risk that more rounds could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that's acceptable and minimizes the risk of a loss. 

This decision balances the potential for a slightly higher price with the certainty of a sale at a price that is significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
