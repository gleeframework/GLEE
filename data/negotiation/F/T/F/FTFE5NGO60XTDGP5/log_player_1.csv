Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is greater than your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $11,500 is less than the $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to buy. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, I'm increasing the likelihood of him accepting the offer while still securing a profit for myself.  If Bob rejects, I can then sell to John for $10,000."
