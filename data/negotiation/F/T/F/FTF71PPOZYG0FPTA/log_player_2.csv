"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product's value to both of you is $1,200,000. This leaves no room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for the same price from John. By rejecting her offer, you might incentivize Alice to offer a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
