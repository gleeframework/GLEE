"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a price that is within his budget."
