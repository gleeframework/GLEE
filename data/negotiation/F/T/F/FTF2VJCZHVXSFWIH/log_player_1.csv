Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000 backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very eager.  
* **Highlight Value and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and the limited-time nature of the offer, creating a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring you don't lose the opportunity to sell to John at your desired minimum."
