"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still below my minimum. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to accepting your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $97.50 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $102.50 for this final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's make this happen.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not sure if it's worth going any further. However, I'm still interested in the product. I'll make one last offer of $98. Can you meet me at this price?",98.0,Bob,8,
