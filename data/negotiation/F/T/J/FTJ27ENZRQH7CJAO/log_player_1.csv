Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but finds the initial price too high.  I'm also hoping to capitalize on his potential eagerness to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a lower price than his offer but higher than what I'm willing to sell to John for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd ideally like, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, and the negotiations seem to be getting closer to a stalemate.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn."
