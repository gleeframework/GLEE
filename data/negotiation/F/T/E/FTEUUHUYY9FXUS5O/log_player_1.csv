I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but not outrageous. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'm going to try and see if I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's higher than my minimum, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to consider. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
