"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $8,500. That would make it a real win-win for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I have to make a living, too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $9,800?",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would allow both of us to get a fair deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I can see you're willing to negotiate, so I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
