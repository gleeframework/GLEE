Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000, which reflects the true worth of this unique item."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  it's always best to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for anything above that gives us room to negotiate while still potentially securing a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with $1,400,000  leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a high chance we can still land a deal significantly above his perceived value and closer to our desired price. 
* **Confident Communication:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the price confidently, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value and willingness to pay.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  We might need to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
