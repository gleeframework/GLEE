"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to both of us. I'd like to propose a price of $140 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $130 to make this deal work for me. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product at $135? It's a bit higher than your proposal but still lower than my initial offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  $135 is a good compromise and saves you $15 compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer secures the product at a decent price without risking further negotiation."
