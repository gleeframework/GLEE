Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and optimistic. It emphasizes the value Bob would receive, increasing the chance of a successful negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a high starting price to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll continue negotiating, potentially making a lower counteroffer.  However, I always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to close the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price without jeopardizing a deal with John.  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a better price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This still represents a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still remaining above Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reaffirming the value of the product. I'm hoping to find a compromise without sacrificing too much.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to maintain the momentum of the negotiation while also keeping the door open to a deal with John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below the $1,000,000 mark. Considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. There's still room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm willing to make a counteroffer closer to his offer to see if we can find common ground. However, I'll keep John's offer as a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,000,000. This is a substantial concession from my previous offer and is a compromise that brings me closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence and emphasizing the value he'll receive.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for him to accept.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic move to push the negotiations forward. By coming down to a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful deal. At the same time, I'm still maintaining a price point that aligns with my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John, but I'm hoping to close this deal with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob might drag on and result in a lower final price. 

**Strategy:**

By selling to John for $1,500,000, I guarantee myself a much higher profit than I would get from accepting Bob's offer.  While I prefer to sell at the highest possible price, it's more important to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements. This ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money, and it's a better long-term strategy than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
