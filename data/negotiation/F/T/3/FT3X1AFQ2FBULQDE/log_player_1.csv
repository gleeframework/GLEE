Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to secure a good price.  I'll be willing to negotiate if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made a concession.  Rather than continue negotiating, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
