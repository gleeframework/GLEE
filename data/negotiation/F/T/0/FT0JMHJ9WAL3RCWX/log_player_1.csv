"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still a good profit for me, but closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more likely he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still too low for me. While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125.  This is my final offer before considering selling to John. I'm hoping to make a compromise and reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price below my minimum acceptable price. While I could counter again, there are only a few rounds left. Given the risk that Bob might continue to reject my offers, it's best to secure the sale to John for $120."
