"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own costs. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1200000. That's my maximum budget for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
