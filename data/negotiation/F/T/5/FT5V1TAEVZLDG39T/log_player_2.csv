"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe its value will bring you great benefit. What do you think about an offer of $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* You can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is your maximum budget.
* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than your budget and what John is offering. 

It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save $200,000."
