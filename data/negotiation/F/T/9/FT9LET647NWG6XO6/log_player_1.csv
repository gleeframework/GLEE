"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation, and also ensures I'm still getting a profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal. I have several more rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,000,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's valuation, making it more likely he'll accept. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so this is my fallback option if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my target of $1,000,000 and a significant profit compared to my minimum of $1,000,000. There is no guarantee that I can get a better offer from Bob or that John will be available in the future. It's better to take a good offer now than to risk losing a sale and potentially ending up with a lower price."
