"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $101.25? Let's work towards a deal that's fair for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $101.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $99, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",99.0,Bob,6,
