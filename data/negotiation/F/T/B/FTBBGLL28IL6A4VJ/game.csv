"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet at $102.50. This would give us both a good deal.",102.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. How about we meet at $98? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stick to my budget",98.0,Bob,6,
