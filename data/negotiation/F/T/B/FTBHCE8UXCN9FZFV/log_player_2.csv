"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means there is room for negotiation. It's a better strategy to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum price. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, or by buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's latest offer is still above Bob's maximum price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price. John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price, so it's the most financially advantageous option."
