"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
