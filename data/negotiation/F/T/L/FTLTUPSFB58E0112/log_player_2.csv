"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her product valuation ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation. While buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's best to see if we can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it gives us a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  We've left considerable space to move upwards towards Alice's valuation while staying well below our $1,500,000 limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down by $100,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still significantly higher than both her valuation and our ideal price. We should continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We've increased our offer by $150,000, showing Alice we're serious about negotiating but also remaining firm on getting a good deal.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is a significant move towards Alice's price, but it's also still below the midpoint between our initial offer and her last counteroffer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, increasing the offer by a larger amount may encourage Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her valuation, and this offer is closer to a potential agreement. However, we are still only $50,000 away from our fallback option with John. We have time for a couple more rounds of negotiation to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Her Valuation:** We know Alice values the product at $1,200,000. This offer aims to meet her at that price, hoping she'll see it as a fair deal and accept.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only a few rounds left, we need to make our position clear. Offering her valuation adds a sense of urgency and signals this is our target price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We still have the option to buy from John at $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in aiming for this lower price."
