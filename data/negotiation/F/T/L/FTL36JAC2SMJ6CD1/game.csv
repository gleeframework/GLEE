"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you immense value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be open to that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get closer to $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about we settle at $980,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is a slight increase from your previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, so I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession. What are your thoughts?",985000.0,Alice,7,
