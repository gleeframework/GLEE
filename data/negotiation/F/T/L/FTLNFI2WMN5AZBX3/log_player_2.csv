"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150, there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
You've already gotten the price down from $130 to $115.  While you could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get more stubborn, and you'll end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
