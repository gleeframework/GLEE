"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. I believe you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal.  Let's see if you can negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While the product sounds interesting, $120 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$115 is a good deal considering your goal is to buy the product for less than $150. You are saving $35 compared to buying from John."
