Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell the product to John for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets it for $400,000 less than its value to him, and we make a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a layer of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly."
