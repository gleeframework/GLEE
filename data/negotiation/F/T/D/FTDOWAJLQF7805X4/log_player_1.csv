"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message can help build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the price more appealing.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** Even though it's above his perceived value, I need to maintain my price to maximize my profit.
* **Selling to John is a viable option.**  This would guarantee my minimum desired price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more suitable price in the next round.** This keeps the negotiation alive while maintaining my leverage. 

I'll use the next round to explore a price closer to my target and see if Bob is willing to budge."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I believe this price still represents great value for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Suggest a middle ground:**  This gives Bob a concrete price point to consider and makes the offer seem more fair.

**Strategy:**  By offering a lower price than my previous offer, I'm showing some willingness to negotiate.  I'm also setting a specific price point to make it easier for Bob to decide.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John as the negotiation seems to be stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While it is a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to meet my needs. 
* **Selling to John is still a viable and more lucrative option.**  This would guarantee my minimum desired price and avoid further negotiation.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price in the next round.** I need to maintain my leverage and try to push Bob closer to my desired price point.

I'll use the next round to explore a price closer to my target and see if Bob is willing to budge further. However, I am getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more attractive option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price to close this deal, but it needs to be above $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,150.  This price is still a good value for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm still not budging much from my desired price point, but I'm demonstrating a small amount of flexibility to keep Bob engaged.
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to see the deal as beneficial.
* **Setting a clear price:** By offering a specific price point, I make it easier for Bob to make a decision and avoid drawn-out negotiations.

**Strategy:**  I'm getting close to the point where selling to John is the more attractive option. This counteroffer is a last attempt to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me closer to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is well below my minimum acceptable price.**  It's clear he's not willing to negotiate further, and I'm unwilling to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price.**  This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and potentially ending up with a much lower profit.
* **Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome.**  He's stated his final offer, and I'm not willing to go lower.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision."
