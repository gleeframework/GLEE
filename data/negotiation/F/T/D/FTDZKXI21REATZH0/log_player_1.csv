Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** While it's more than your minimum, it's still below the product's value to Bob. This increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It directly communicates the offer and leaves room for Bob to respond.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By stating that you think the price is fair, you are open to discussion but have set a firm starting point.

If Bob rejects, you can consider his counteroffer and adjust your own accordingly, or choose to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't seem to be going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's higher than your minimum, it's still below your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further with Bob. You can see if there's room to compromise, potentially at $115, before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115.  This would still leave me a bit of profit and it's a fair price for the product's value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to your minimum, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation. You've already lowered your price considerably and it's clear that Bob is trying to get the best possible deal for himself.  It's time to cut your losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
