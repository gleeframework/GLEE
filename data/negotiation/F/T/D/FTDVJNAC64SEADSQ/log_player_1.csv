Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects a fair market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to the initial ask, there's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $2,000,000 for the product. This offer stands as a firm reflection of its value."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between our last two offers. This shows a willingness to compromise but also establishes a firm price point. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but we're still in a strong position. We're aiming for a significantly higher price than John's offer, and we have time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I respect your position. Let's make this clear â€“ I'm highly motivated to close this deal with you.  My final offer is $1,950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal this is our final offer.  We're making a smaller concession this round, showing we're firm but still open to closing the deal. Highlighting our motivation adds pressure for Bob to accept. This price is still a substantial profit over John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has stalled out and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer at $1,800,000 still yields a significant profit ($300,000) over John's offer. It's better to secure the deal now than risk Bob walking away in the next round."
