You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly employing sales tactics by inflating the product's value to you ($1,500,000). While her offer is lower than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what she values the product at ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're savvy and looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to come back with a lower price closer to her true valuation."
