Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low. I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price that allows us both to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal with him at this point. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
