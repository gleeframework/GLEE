"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your position. How about we consider $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,375,000.  However, I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
