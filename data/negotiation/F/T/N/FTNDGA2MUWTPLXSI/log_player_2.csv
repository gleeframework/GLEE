"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your position. How about we consider $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget of $1,200,000.  Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  He can either make a counteroffer closer to his maximum budget or accept John's offer.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations open and allows Bob to explore more options."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm prepared to come down slightly to $1,360,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What are your thoughts?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,360,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely that Alice will drop the price enough to make it worthwhile for Bob.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most financially sensible decision to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
