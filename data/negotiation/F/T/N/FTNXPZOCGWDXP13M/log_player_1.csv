Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for Bob's profit:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he would still make a $100,000 profit if he accepted the offer. This makes it a worthwhile deal for him.
* **It's a strong negotiating position:**  By offering a price closer to my minimum, I create a sense of urgency for Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not losing out significantly."
