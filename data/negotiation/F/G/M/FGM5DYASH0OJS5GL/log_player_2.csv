"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $13,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $13,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll lower the price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. 
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
