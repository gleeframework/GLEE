,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $9500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7000, given my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $7500, and I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and quality. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $8000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $7750. This shows my commitment to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $7900. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",7900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7900 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $7800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",7800.0,Bob,8,
