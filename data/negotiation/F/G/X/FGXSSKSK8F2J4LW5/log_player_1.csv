Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially meet in the middle.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** We have John as a backup buyer, ensuring we won't be forced to sell below our minimum price."
