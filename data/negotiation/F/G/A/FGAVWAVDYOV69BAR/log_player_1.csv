"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to accept yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm determined to see if I can secure a price closer to $1,800,000.  I'll counteroffer once more and see where this takes us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,650,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I only have two rounds left, so I'm going to make one final counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to budge."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While $1,600,000 is still above my minimum, I'm out of time. I've reached the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by rejecting Bob's offer and potentially getting no offer at all.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
