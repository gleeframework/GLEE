,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $150 is my absolute bottom line. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",125.0,Bob,6,
