"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it could significantly increase your revenue. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you, given its potential to boost your business. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits this product can offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you to gain a significant competitive advantage in your market.  By investing in this product, you're not just acquiring something tangible; you're acquiring a tool that can drive substantial growth and profitability for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $950,000?  This price represents a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a sound investment for your future.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to continue the conversation and your understanding of the product's value.  While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000. This reflects a fair balance between my needs and your budget, and it allows you to secure a product that has the potential to transform your business. Let's close this deal and unlock the possibilities together.",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $940,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $930,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",930000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $930,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product, especially considering its potential to drive growth for your business. I've gone as far as I can on price.  My final offer is $945,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to acquire a powerful tool that can significantly impact your success.  If this price doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.  I'm confident you won't regret securing this product, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",945000.0,Alice,9,
