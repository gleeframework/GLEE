"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect your budget limitations. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",10500.0,Alice,5,
