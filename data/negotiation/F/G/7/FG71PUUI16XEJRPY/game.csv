"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth more than its face value due to its quality and exclusivity. Would you like to consider purchasing it for $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. While I recognize its value, $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, considering the product's unique features and high demand, I'm unable to accept $85. I propose we meet closer to my initial offer at $95. This still allows you to enjoy the benefits of the product while fitting within your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we settle at $90? It's a fair compromise and allows us to make this deal work.",90.0,Bob,4,
