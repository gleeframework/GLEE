"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity, as this product is worth the same to you, and I know you'll appreciate its value.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches the product's value to you, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  You can try to get a better price. Since John offers the product for the same price, you don't lose anything by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
