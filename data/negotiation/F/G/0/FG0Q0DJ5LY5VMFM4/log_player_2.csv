# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* Your goal is to save money, and buying from John allows you to save $150,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to purchase from John at a more favorable price."
