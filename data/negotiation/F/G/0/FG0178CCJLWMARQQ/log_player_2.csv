"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **You're looking for the best deal:** While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no incentive to accept immediately. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as you don't know Alice's minimum price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $3,000 drop is significant but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but are also looking for a better price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  A $12,000 offer allows for some negotiation if Alice counters, but still keeps you within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $12000 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress made:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair compromise:** $13,500 is a reasonable middle ground, representing a significant saving from her initial offer and a small increase from your counteroffer.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more, but it risks Alice returning to her initial price or even rejecting further offers.  Buying from John offers no price advantage and could potentially lead to missing out on a deal with Alice."
