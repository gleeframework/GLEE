"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely useful.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $11,000 exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision to achieve his goal."
