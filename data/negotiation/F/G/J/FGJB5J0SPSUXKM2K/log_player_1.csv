"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It's important to set a high bar early on, as I can always come down in price later.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, but still keeping it below my initial offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price, as Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going back to Bob's previous offer, as it's a good compromise point.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle, especially since we're already halfway through the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached the point where Bob is unwilling to pay more than $800,000.  While I'd ideally like to get more,  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale.  John is offering me my minimum price, so I'll accept his offer and sell to him."
