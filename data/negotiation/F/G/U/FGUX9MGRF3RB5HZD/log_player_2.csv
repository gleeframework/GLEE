It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're unlikely to get a significantly better price from Alice.  She's consistently coming down in smaller increments.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate costs time, and there's no guarantee of a much better outcome. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $675,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.

While we could push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
