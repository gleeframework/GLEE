"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your openness to negotiation, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm still willing to negotiate.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but that's as low as I can go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. How about $8,900? It's a small step closer to your price and a good compromise. I'm eager to make this deal happen, so let's see if we can find common ground.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,700, but I'm getting close to considering the offer from John. Can you do any better?",8700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're considering John's offer, and I understand. I'm willing to go down to $8,800.  This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I really believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.",8800.0,Alice,7,
