"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your openness to negotiation, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm still willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to push for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. How about $8,900? It's a small step closer to your price and a good compromise. I'm eager to make this deal happen, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,700, but I'm getting close to considering the offer from John. Can you do any better? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,700 is tempting,  I'm not yet convinced it's the best deal. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can meet in the middle. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're considering John's offer, and I understand. I'm willing to go down to $8,800.  This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I really believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal before we both lose out."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600, but that's as low as I can go. If you can do any better, I'd be happy to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go any higher, and I'm not comfortable accepting anything lower than $8,800.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
