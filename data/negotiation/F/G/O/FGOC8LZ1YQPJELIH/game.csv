"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $850000.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a good deal and you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
