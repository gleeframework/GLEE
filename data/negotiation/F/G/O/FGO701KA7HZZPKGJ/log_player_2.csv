"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own product valuation, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a better offer, or you can simply proceed with buying from John."
