Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get the highest price possible, and since Bob values the product, there's a chance he might pay more than the guaranteed $100 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a price higher than $100 but lower than $150. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" :**  Creates a sense of scarcity and value.

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed $100 sale, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome. This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
