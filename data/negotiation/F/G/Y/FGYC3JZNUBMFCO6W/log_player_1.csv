Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message implies value by mentioning offering it to Bob before a public listing.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This knowledge gives you leverage."
