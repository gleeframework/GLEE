,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $900,000.  This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
