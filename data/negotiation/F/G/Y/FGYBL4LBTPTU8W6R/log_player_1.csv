Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a slightly inflated price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to see if he's genuinely interested and what his maximum price is.  I'm also confident in selling to John for $100, so I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum desired price of $100, giving me a better chance of reaching a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm confident I can sell the product to John for $100, so that's the best option for me at this point."
