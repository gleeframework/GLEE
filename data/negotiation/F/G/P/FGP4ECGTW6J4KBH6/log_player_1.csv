"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the immense value it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000), I aim to set a high anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows for concessions during the negotiation process, signaling a willingness to find a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in the offered price, conveying confidence in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about we aim for $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. There's potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since we have eight rounds remaining. I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. This product offers tremendous potential for your business, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. To move forward, I could consider $2,000,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise while still acknowledging the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Adjustment:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value and positions the lower price as a significant concession.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $2,000,000 keeps me above Bob's perceived value and provides room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still working within a specific budget. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $1,800,000? This would allow me to invest in the product without straining my finances too much. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a strong interest in the product.  While $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000. With six rounds remaining, there's room for further negotiation. I'll counter-offer again to test his willingness to move closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. Let's split the difference. How about $1,900,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing a price exactly halfway between our last offers, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher value. 
* **Simplified Offer:** The message is short and to the point, emphasizing the fairness and straightforwardness of the offer.
* **Pressure to Close:** As we progress through the rounds, Bob may become more amenable to accepting a price closer to my target to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Let's try $1,850,000. This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers, allowing me to secure the product within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,850,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum price ($1,500,000) and a reasonable compromise from my initial ask.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are becoming smaller with each round. Bob's willingness to meet me almost halfway suggests this is close to his maximum.
* **Time Value and Risk:**  Continuing negotiations increases the risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable price and avoids potentially losing the deal altogether."
