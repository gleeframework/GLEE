"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  Let's see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $160 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident we can reach a deal closer to my initial asking price. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get even more, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, we may run out of time and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $150.  $165 is a good compromise and ensures a profit, so I'll accept his offer."
