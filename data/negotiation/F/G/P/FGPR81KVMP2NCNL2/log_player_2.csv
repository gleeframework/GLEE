"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a significant savings for you and a strong return for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still significantly above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a significant drop from the original price, Bob is still better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob doesn't want to overspend unnecessarily."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us - a good return for me while still representing a valuable opportunity for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price Bob is comfortable with.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and secures the product."
