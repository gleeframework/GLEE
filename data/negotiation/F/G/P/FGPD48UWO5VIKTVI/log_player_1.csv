"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $10,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $13,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to compromise a bit and meet Bob halfway.  I'm offering $14,000, hoping it's a price he's willing to accept.  It's still above my minimum of $10,000 and closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved up slightly from his previous offer, and I'm willing to accept $13,500. It's a good price considering my minimum and it feels like we're reaching a good compromise."
