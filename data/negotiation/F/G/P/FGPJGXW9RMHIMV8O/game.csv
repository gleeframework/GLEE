"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. As we value this product at $1200000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in your product, $1100000 is a bit above my initial target. I'd like to propose a price of $950000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1025000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you place on it.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
