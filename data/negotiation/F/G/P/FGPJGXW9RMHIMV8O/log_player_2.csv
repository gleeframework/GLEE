"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. As we value this product at $1200000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can potentially get a better price by counteroffering.
* **You're not desperate.** You have a fallback option in John, so you can afford to be patient and negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm interested in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my initial target. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $1025000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.**  It's a significant drop from her initial offer and is closer to your desired price. 
* **The risk of going lower is not worth it.** While you could try for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject it again. This could lead to a stalemate or you needing to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  $1,025,000 is significantly less than your maximum price of $1,500,000.  

By accepting Alice's offer, you secure the product at a price that's favorable to you while avoiding unnecessary delays and potential losses."
