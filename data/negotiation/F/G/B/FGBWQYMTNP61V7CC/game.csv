"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $120, and that's as low as I can go.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm looking for something closer to $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $125 to be worth my while. How about we meet at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, I need to make at least $125 to break even. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your constraints, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Please consider this offer.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, I need to make at least $125 to break even. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm starting to think I should just sell it to John for $100, but I'll give you one last chance. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about selling this to me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to buy it from John for $80. It's your choice.",85.0,Bob,10,
