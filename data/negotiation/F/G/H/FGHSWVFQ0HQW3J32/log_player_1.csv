Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating down slightly, while still getting you a better price than John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price point is just above Bob's perceived value ($80), so it might encourage him to consider it if he finds your pitch convincing."
