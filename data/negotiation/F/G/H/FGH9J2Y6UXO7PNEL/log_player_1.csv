Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor:** This initial high price sets an anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to the desired amount than starting lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
