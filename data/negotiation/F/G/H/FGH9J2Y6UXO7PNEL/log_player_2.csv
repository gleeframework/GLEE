"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might be willing to walk away."
