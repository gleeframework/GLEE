"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for me. I want to see if he's willing to pay a significant amount close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm not yet at a point where I'd consider selling to John for $10,000.  I'll see if I can push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $13,000. It's a compromise, but it's still a decent profit for me, and it shows that I'm serious about making a deal. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm not yet at a point where I'd consider selling to John, and I believe there's still some room for negotiation with Bob. I'll see if I can push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm close to my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  This is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already made significant concessions.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Bob.  To avoid losing any money, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  This will guarantee me at least my minimum desired profit."
