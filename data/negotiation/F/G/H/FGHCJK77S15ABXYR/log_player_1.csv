"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to build a rapport with Bob.
* **Asking for feedback:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially reveal his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I need to aim for a better deal.
* **Moving to the next round:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $105? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns and offering a compromise by lowering my price to $105. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob by reminding him that $105 is ""still a good price."" 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away the product at a loss.  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your flexibility, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $100 is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or losing time.
* **Securing the sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't miss out on the opportunity to sell to John, who is also offering $100."
