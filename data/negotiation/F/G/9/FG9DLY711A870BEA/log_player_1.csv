"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes a friendly tone and invites Bob to engage in the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  It's lower than the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Provides a clear price:**  A specific price is given, making it easier for Bob to decide.
* **Focuses on finding a middle ground:**  The ""meet in the middle"" language suggests a desire to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $97 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains a firm stance:**  It's not a drastic reduction, showing that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Focuses on fairness:**  It emphasizes the price being ""fair"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Offers a final compromise:**  The language suggests that this is a final offer, prompting Bob to make a decision."
