{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum price:**  This makes it appealing to Bob, who values the product at $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can still make some profit while giving Bob some wiggle room to counter-offer.
* **It's a clear signal of my commitment:** I'm not just throwing out a random number, I've done some thinking about what's a fair price.

By starting the negotiation with a strong offer, I hope to encourage Bob to counter-offer and allow for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum price of $1,200,000. It's also significantly lower than the $800,000 he values the product at. This suggests he's trying to take advantage of the situation. 

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000,  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially considering he's already expressed interest.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This would give you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my minimum:**  While still a significant discount from my ideal price,  $850,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as a good deal for *both* of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm not locking myself into this price. This allows for flexibility if Bob counters again. 

By offering a reasonable counter-offer, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully secure a price that is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, even though it represents a good deal for Bob. 

I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means going back and forth a few more times. The fact that Bob is willing to negotiate at all suggests he wants the product and is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $775,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This shows I'm trying to find a middle ground, making it appear more reasonable.
* **Reinforcing the fair deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  While it's not ideal, $775,000 is still above my minimum price, and potentially closer to a deal.

By offering a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, I hope to encourage him to accept the deal and avoid having to go to John for a higher price."
