Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This allows for some negotiation room while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk him continuing to haggle.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price. I'm going to sell the product to John."
