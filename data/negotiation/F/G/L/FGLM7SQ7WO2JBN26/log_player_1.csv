Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you need to find a price Bob is willing to accept that's significantly higher than your minimum. 

Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob Saves Money:** Bob gets the product for $75,000 less than his valuation.
* **You Maximize Profit:** You secure a profit of $125,000, which is significantly more than John's offer.

The message also introduces a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") to encourage Bob to accept quickly."
