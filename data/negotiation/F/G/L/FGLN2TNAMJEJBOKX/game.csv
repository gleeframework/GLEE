"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
