"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your business. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob's business creates a sense of urgency and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites further discussion, showing flexibility and willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **More negotiating room:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the concession:** I'm emphasizing that the $1,600,000 price is a significant concession from my initial position, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to see the value of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has offered that amount. 
* **No further gains likely:**  It's unlikely that I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds, especially since John is offering the same amount.
* **Time is a factor:**  While I can continue negotiating, there's a chance that Bob will reject further offers, and I'll be left with John's offer, which is the same as Bob's. 

Accepting the offer secures the desired minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation, potentially leading to a lower price or no sale."
