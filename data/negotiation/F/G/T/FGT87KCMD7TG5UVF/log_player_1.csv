Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After all, I want to get as much money as I can for my product!

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks about this price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $800,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I think I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer!
