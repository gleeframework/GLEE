"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a compromise, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  This offer takes our respective positions into account while still reflecting the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
