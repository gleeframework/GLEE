"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. Can you meet me in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can do $14500, which is a reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I can do $14000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a reasonable price for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $13500, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,9,
