Round 9
Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $780,000. With only one round left and no guarantee she'll come down further, it's time to cut my losses. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a sure thing, and while it's not ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome in the final round."
