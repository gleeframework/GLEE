Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($15,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a strong safety net. There's no need to drastically lower the price for Bob."
