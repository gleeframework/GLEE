# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
