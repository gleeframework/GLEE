Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $150 is still above my target price of $100, but it's much closer. It's also a better deal than buying from John. I'll accept the offer."
