"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still within a range that Bob might consider. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially find a price we're both happy with. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps establish a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's less than my minimum acceptable price, and it's only $100, which is what he values the product at.  I need to try and get a higher price from him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  $150 is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm still maintaining a friendly and professional tone, aiming to keep the negotiations open.
* **Compromise:**  While $150 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
