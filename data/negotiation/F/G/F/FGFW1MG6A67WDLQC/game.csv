"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm definitely interested, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me is quite significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects its potential and leaves us both with a beneficial outcome.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price is within my budget, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
