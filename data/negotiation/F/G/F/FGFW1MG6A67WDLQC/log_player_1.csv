Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm definitely interested, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price is within my budget, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
