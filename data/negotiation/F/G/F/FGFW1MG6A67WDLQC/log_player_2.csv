"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a bit high, and there's room for negotiation. Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm definitely interested, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me is quite significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects its potential and leaves us both with a beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my target.  I'm still willing to negotiate further.  There are 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price is within my budget, and it allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
