"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?  I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While the product is nice, $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. I can tell you're serious about the value this product offers.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $13,250? This is my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,5,
