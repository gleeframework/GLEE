"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,5,
