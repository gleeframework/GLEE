Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than I'm guaranteed to receive from John, so it gives Bob an incentive to buy.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** By aiming for a higher price, I maximize my potential earnings.
* **Risk mitigation:**  Even if Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **No information about Bob's valuation:**  Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, offering a higher price increases my chances of securing a better deal. 

It's a gamble, but it's a calculated one. I'm willing to risk losing a sale to John in the hopes of securing a significantly higher price from Bob."
