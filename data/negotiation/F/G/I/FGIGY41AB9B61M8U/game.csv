"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer Alice, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value it brings me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
