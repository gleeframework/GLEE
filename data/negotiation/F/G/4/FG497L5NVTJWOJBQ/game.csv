"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $170, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $170 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $125? That's a significant reduction on my part.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for considering my offer. $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both get what we need.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $95 is close, but I need to get at least $110 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me there?",110.0,Alice,5,
