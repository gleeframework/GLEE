"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $170, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $170 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $125? That's a significant reduction on my part."", ""product_price"": 125}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for considering my offer. $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair compromise, and we can both get what we need.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $95 is close, but I need to get at least $110 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
