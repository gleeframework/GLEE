Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I will choose to sell the product to Bob.
