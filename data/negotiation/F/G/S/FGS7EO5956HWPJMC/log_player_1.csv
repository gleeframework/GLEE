"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the value of the product to Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:** $150 is a starting point, leaving space for me to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is more beneficial for both of us. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round.  I have time to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $150 to $130, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly suggesting that we should close the deal now to avoid missing out on the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product off my hands and don't lose any more time in negotiation."
