"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $800000. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm offering it to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $950000, which is $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $925000 is still a bit too low. I'm offering it to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $975000, which is $950000. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower than that, to $925000. I believe this is the maximum price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $950000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering it to you for $990000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",990000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $990000. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to accept it as my final offer. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,10,
