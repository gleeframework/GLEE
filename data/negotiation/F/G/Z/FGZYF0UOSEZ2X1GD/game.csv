"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of the product.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price.  To be honest, anything over $700,000 and I'm better off going with a different vendor. Is $650,000 doable for you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to be flexible, but $650,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Let's do this - I can go as low as $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're on board.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  If you can't do $700,000, I think it's best I explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
