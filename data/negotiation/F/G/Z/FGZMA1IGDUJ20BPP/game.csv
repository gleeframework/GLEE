"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115?  I'm really hoping to get this product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down to $120. That would still give me a fair profit, and I think it's a good deal for you too, considering how much you value this product.",120.0,Alice,3,
