Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit above our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $120 gives us leverage in the negotiation. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price than John while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
