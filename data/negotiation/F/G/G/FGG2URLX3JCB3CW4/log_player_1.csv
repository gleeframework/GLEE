"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Interest:** I'm framing the message as a potential benefit for Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using a question at the end to encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue.

**Note:** This is just my first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:** While it's closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still below my $15,000 floor.
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my value.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John is tempting, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob, considering he might be willing to pay more.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I will need to assess the risk of him rejecting my offer and potentially reaching a lower price. However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to create a sense of collaboration and hopefully reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to assess the remaining rounds and the risk of reaching a lower price. I may need to make further concessions, but I'll try to stay above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is appealing, I have a few rounds left and want to explore if I can reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob seems willing to compromise, and I might be able to push him a little higher.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the risk of getting stuck with a lower price. However, I'm still hopeful of reaching a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm raising my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating that I'm not going to settle for a price too far below my target.
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially making him feel more inclined to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm adding a phrase like ""Let's make this happen"" to subtly increase the pressure and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to weigh the remaining rounds against the risk of selling to John for a lower price. I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but I'll aim to stay above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to offer $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching my target price is increasing. However, I believe I can still potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Potential for Agreement:** Bob's willingness to increase his offer suggests that there's still room for compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target. I need to be strategic and assess the risk of getting stuck with a lower price, but I am still hopeful that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I still need to be a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing that I'm flexible but not willing to completely cave to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, hoping to appeal to his logic.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using language like ""find a solution"" to emphasize a collaborative approach and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. With fewer rounds remaining, the pressure is on to reach a deal. I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but I'll aim to stay above my minimum acceptable value while also considering the risk of losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to offer $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the chance of getting Bob to meet my minimum acceptable price is dwindling.
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's offer hasn't significantly increased, and it's unlikely he will offer anything higher in the next round.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on the deal. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer outweighs the potential of a small increase in the next round. It's a calculated decision based on the limited time and the need to secure a guaranteed profit."
