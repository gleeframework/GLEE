{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts with a price that's below Bob's perceived value but still leaves a significant profit margin for you.  It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent profit, you can likely get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 110}
