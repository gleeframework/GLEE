"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a bold opening offer, but it reflects the fact that the product is worth at least that much to me.  I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it still allows for a healthy profit for me. I'm hoping this compromise will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,100,000 is still a bit too low. I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm going to keep pushing.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 more than John's offer, so I'm not leaving much room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in this deal and is willing to close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I think I can push for a bit more. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,200,000. This is the same as John's offer, so I'm essentially calling Bob's bluff.  I'm hoping that he values the product enough to accept this final offer. If he rejects it, I can always go with John, and at least ensure I get my minimum price."
