"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $110. That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, $110 is a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's lower offer."
