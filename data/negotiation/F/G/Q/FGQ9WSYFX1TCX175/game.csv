"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it might hold. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth and what it can do for your business.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
