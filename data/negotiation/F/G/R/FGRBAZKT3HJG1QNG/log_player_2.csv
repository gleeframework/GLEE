"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:**  Alice is now offering $875,000, which is much closer to Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting, he risks Alice becoming less flexible. There's also the chance that John's offer might disappear or become less favorable.
* **Small margin for error:**  While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price, the difference between $875,000 and his target is not substantial enough to warrant the risk of further negotiation."
