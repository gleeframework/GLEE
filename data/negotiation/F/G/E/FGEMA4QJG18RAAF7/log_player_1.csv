"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a decent profit.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only afford to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. $10,500 is closer to my ideal, but I think I can get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $11,000? That's still a fantastic deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm sticking with $11,000. I'm hoping that by showing consistency and reiterating the value for Bob, he'll be willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go beyond $10,500. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and while I'd like to get closer to $11,000, Bob seems set on $10,500. I'm going to accept his offer, as it's still a decent profit for me and beats selling to John."
