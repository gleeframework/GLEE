"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $95. It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $100, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $97.50, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $102. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so how about we try $101?",101.0,Alice,7,
