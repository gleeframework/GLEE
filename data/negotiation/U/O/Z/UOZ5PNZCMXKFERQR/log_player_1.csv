{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but below what I could get from John. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, implying he might miss out if he doesn't take the offer.

I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and my assessment of his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees $150,  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping the price from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not dropping to Bob's initial offer, indicating that I'm serious about getting a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $140 is a good price for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **Time Factor:**  I don't want to spend too much time on this negotiation, as I have a guaranteed sale with John.

I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $150 sale with John, as the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob don't outweigh the risks."
