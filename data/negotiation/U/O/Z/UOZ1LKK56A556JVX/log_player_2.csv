"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not a good deal to accept $11,000 when you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your limit.  You can try to negotiate a bit further."
