"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While $9500 is closer to my range, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This reflects my budget and ensures we both benefit from a successful transaction.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $9000? This is a fair midpoint between our previous offers, allowing you to stay within your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit from the sale.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust our offer further. How about setting the product price at $8900? This is a step towards meeting your budget while still ensuring a decent return for me.",8900.0,Alice,5,
