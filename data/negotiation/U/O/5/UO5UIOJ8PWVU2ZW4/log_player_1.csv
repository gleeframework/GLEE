{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 12500}
