{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and John provides a guaranteed sale at that price, there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Here's why starting at $2,000,000 is a good strategy:

* **Anchoring:**  Starting high sets a reference point for the negotiation. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial price, it frames the product as highly valuable.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more than $1,500,000, especially if the product is truly unique or in high demand.  
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer.  We can then negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. If he outright rejects the $2,000,000, you can gradually lower the price, ensuring you don't go below your safety net of $1,500,000."
