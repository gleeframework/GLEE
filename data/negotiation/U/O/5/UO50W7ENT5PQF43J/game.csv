"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I can come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While $900,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
