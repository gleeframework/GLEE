"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,500. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can agree.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal.  While $9,250 is tempting, it's still not quite in my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,500, which is the minimum price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $9,125. Let's see if we can make this work.",9125.0,Alice,7,
