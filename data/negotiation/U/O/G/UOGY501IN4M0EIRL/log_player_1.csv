Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm thinking $130 would be a fair price, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone might make Bob more likely to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly saying ""what do you think?"" to indicate I'm open to a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value of $150 while still securing a good price for myself. If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you place on it. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, I can likely do better than that by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground closer to my initial asking price of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm still willing to work with you to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm countering with $115, which is halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a decent price.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and positive to encourage further negotiation.
* **Express Willingness to Work Together:**  I emphasize that I'm still ""willing to work with you"" to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to offer $110 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk is that Bob might walk away and I'd be stuck selling to John for $100. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good price and a successful sale."
