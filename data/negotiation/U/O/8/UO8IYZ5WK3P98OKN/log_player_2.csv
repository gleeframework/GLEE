"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850000. This is a fair price, given its value to both of us. I believe this deal will be mutually beneficial, as it allows you to acquire a product worth $800000 to you while ensuring I receive a satisfactory return on my investment. Consider this a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800000 should you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
