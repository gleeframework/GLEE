"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $120 to start the conversation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $95. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
