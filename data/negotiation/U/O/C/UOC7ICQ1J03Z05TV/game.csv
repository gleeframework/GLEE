"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident this deal can work out.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
