"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. My asking price is $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is way above your budget and even her product's value to her. There's room for negotiation, but it's highly unlikely she'll go as low as $80. You're better off going with John's offer."
