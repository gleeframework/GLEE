Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. My asking price is $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours. By starting high, you can gauge how interested he truly is. If he's willing to negotiate, there might be a price point that works for both of you. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. This allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob. You're not desperate to make the sale, which puts you in a stronger position. 

**Important Note:** While the initial offer is high,  Alice leaves room for negotiation with ""reasonable offers."" This opens the door for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
