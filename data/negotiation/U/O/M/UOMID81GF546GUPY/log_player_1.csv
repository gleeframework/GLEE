**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get closer to our initial asking price, Bob has been consistently raising his offer and is now at $1,250,000.  This is a significant profit above our minimum sale price to John ($1,000,000). 

Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids potentially missing out on a deal altogether."
