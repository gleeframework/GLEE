"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. While I'm closer to my goal, I'd like to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below what I value the product at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal with more negotiation rounds. I have 6 more rounds to make a deal with Bob before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it slightly above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value of the product, it's still below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I have four more rounds to negotiate with Bob before I need to consider selling to John, and I'm hoping to secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as it's already above his perceived value. However, if he rejects, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I only have two rounds left before I have to make a decision. It's not likely that I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum.  John is a sure bet for a deal that meets my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
