Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $125 is a little too low for me.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about $130?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $130 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price, but you're still a bit above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down just a little more.  You have 5 rounds left, and John is always a safe backup."

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $128 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $130.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

You've been negotiating with Alice for a while, and while you're close to your target price, you still haven't reached it. You have only 3 rounds left. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed deal at $120. You're still getting a good price, and you don't want to risk running out of time."
