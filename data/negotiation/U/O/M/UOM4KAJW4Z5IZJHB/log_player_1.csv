``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" and Bob's potential happiness to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going. 

This strategy aims to establish a high initial price while also leaving room for flexibility, preparing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $150. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and we have 8 more rounds to negotiate. I can likely push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed option.**  While I'd prefer to get the highest possible price, selling to John for $150 is a safe and reliable backup. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and avoid settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** $135 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit.
