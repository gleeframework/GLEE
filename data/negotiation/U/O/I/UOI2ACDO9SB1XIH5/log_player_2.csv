Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll need to think about it. Let me make you a revised offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  Alice seems unlikely to budge much lower than her current offer of $10,500. It's not worth risking a higher price in later rounds when John offers a guaranteed $8,000."
