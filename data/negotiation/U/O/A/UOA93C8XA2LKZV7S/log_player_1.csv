"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's in great condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is a good price for me, and it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
