{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $155 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still slightly above your comfort zone. 
* You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get Alice down to your ideal price.

* Buying from John for $120 guarantees you the product within your budget. It's a safe and sensible option."
