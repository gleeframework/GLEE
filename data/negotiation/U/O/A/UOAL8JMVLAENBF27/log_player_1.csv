{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at $10,000. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong initial price close to my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a sale close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept and secure a sale, it's far below my desired value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While it's a great product, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll make another counteroffer, but if he continues to refuse, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $7,750 is still too far off for me.  Let's try $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a compromise on my part.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
