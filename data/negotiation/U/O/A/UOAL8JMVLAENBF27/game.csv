"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I value at $10,000. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While it's a great product, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $7,750 is still too far off for me.  Let's try $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a compromise on my part.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
