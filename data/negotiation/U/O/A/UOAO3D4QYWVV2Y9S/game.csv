"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price point, closer to  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $800,000? That's a fair offer, and it allows me to get a good deal while ensuring you still make a profit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a good price for you, but I'm not sure if it's enough for me to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
