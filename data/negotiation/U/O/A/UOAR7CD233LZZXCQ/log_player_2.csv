"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's best to reject and start negotiating.  There's a good chance I can get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is definitely out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to my budget than $20,000, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $14,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still above my comfort zone.  I've already rejected Alice's last two offers and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation.  It's better to just go with John's offer and get the product for $10,000, which is within my budget and a good deal overall."
