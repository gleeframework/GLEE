"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is definitely out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
