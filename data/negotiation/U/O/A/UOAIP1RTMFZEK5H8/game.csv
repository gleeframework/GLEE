"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but I think that's the highest I can go.

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000. However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for me.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $980000, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1095000.

If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",990000.0,Bob,10,
