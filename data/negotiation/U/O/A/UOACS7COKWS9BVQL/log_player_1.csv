Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The offer is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150).  This creates a potential win-win scenario if Bob is willing to negotiate a bit higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage negotiation (""Let me know what you think!""). 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a lower offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might consider lowering the price to increase the chances of Bob accepting."
