"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  Let me know if you're open to that.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",135.0,Alice,5,
