Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope we can find common ground.

This price still gives me a decent return on my investment, while also allowing you to acquire a product that's worth $1,000,000 to your business.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
