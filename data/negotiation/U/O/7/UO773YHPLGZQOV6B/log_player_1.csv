"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to John, and Bob is offering $12,500. While this is still a good price, it's worth seeing if I can get closer to my target of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is the same as John's offer.  There's no further room for negotiation, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with John to see if I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. I'll take the guaranteed $12,000."
