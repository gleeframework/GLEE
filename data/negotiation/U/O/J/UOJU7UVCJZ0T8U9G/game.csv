,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150? It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I can do $130, that's the best I can offer. I'm trying to get a good deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. How about $140?  It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer $135. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! $135 is getting pretty close to what I was hoping for. How about $140? I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. Let's make a deal!",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $137.50? That's the best I can do.",137.5,Bob,8,
