Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is exactly my minimum threshold, but I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is offering the same price.  Selling to John allows me to close the deal quickly and without further negotiation."
