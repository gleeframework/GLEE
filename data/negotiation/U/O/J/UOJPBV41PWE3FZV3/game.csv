"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
