"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for a lower price than from John, and it's always worth exploring your options."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has moved closer to your ideal price.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting this offer saves you $800 compared to buying from John."
