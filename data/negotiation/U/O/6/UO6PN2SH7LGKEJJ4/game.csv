"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the market value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,050,000. How about $925,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference - $987,500. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to cover your costs, but $987,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
