Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a valuable opportunity, highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive in my initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if it's a much better deal. How about $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and far below my initial offer. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further. If not, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $650,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my position. I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Price:** My counteroffer is closer to my initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value while keeping the negotiation open. I believe that $950,000 is a realistic price that reflects the product's worth and potentially incentivizes Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving some on the price, but $950,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $725,000 if you're serious about selling. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While there is potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with a price lower than John's offer is not worth it.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.  Even though it's not my ideal price, it's a safe and reliable option that ensures I don't lose more money trying to negotiate with Bob."
