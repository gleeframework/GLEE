"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life and streamline your routines. Given its unique features and high-quality materials, I believe it's worth more than $80. Let's start with an offer of $120. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the information about the product.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you consider $100? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Therefore, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. $110 is a good price, especially considering I have a backup option of buying from John for $150.  Accepting the offer allows me to save $40 compared to buying from John, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
