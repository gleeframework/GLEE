Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $140 is a reasonable compromise. It avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely and still earns a profit over my minimum."
