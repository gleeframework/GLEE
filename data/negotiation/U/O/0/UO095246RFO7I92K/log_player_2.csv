"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  You have room to lower the price since Alice values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer means you get a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price adjustments.  It's not worth the risk of potentially pushing Alice to a deal-breaking point or having to resort to John's higher price."
