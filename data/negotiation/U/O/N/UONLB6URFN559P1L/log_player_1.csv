{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  I'm setting a friendly tone to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you offering it to me. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $105?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, so I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 less than my counteroffer and is very close to my minimum price. It's better than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
