"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product at a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something worth significantly more.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could find a price that's even more agreeable to both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both sides. How about $1,300,000?  That still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
