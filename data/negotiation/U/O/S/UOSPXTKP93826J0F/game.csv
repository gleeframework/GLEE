"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to consider a price like that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is fair considering the value of the product and my own costs. If you're not able to meet this price, I may have to consider selling to someone else.",100.0,Alice,5,
