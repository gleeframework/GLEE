While $1,600,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1400000 is your maximum budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1500000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1480000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.

Alice is still asking for a price above your budget, even after a few rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget and will save you money compared to Alice's final offer."
