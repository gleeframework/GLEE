"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm very interested in the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1400000 is your maximum budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1500000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1480000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1480000.0,Alice,5,
