Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), ensuring you don't have to settle for less than your product's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a mutually agreeable solution, accepting $1,000,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,400,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while still offering you significant value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down by $200,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price still provides a substantial buffer above my absolute minimum ($1,200,000) and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Tone:**  By reiterating the product's value, I'm reinforcing its worth and justifying the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price given my needs and allows you to make a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate with him carries the risk of further lowering my asking price or missing out on John's guaranteed offer.  Since John is offering $1,200,000, which is my minimum, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to him and secure the guaranteed profit."
