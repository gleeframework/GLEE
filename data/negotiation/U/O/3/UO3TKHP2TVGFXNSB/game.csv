"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you.  I know it's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very advantageous for both of us.  Consider this my best offer: $1,400,000.  This price ensures a solid profit for me while still leaving you with a substantial gain.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
