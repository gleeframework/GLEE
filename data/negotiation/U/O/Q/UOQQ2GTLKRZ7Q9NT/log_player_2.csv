"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test the waters. Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.  A $950,000 offer is a good starting point, leaving a sizable margin for potential negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial offer of $1,100,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a counteroffer pushing the price closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000 is present. It's more prudent to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
