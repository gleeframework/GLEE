"I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. This product is only worth $8,000 to me.  I'm willing to offer you that if you're interested in making a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could potentially do $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price if you're interested.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000, which is still a good deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
