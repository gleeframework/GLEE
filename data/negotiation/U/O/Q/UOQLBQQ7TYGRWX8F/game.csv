"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, and for meeting me halfway.  To be honest, I have another offer at $10,750.  If you can match that, I'll buy it from you today.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you have another offer, but I'm not willing to match it just yet. I'm willing to get closer to your offer, though. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $10,600. It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done.",10600.0,Alice,7,
