"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $95 is still above your $100 limit. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.** You can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to exhaust all other options before resorting to his $100 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in this product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:**  $85 is still below your $100 limit, so you're not risking overspending.
* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Message is polite and positive:** This helps maintain a good rapport with Alice."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $92.50 is still above your $100 limit. 
* **There's room for further negotiation:** You can try to push for a lower price, especially since Alice acknowledged your desire for a good deal.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort:**  It's best to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a little out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $90 is still within your $100 limit.
* **Counteroffer is close to Alice's offer:**  It shows you are serious about buying the product and are willing to meet her halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $91.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit:** While it's getting closer, $91.50 is still above your $100 limit. 
* **You're close to reaching your target price:** You've successfully brought the price down significantly, and you might be able to get it even lower with another counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort:** You're still within your negotiation rounds, and you want to see if you can close the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $90.  I really want this product, but I just can't go any higher. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is your target price:**  You've consistently stuck to your target of $90, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal.
* **Message is assertive but respectful:** You express your desire for the product but also reiterate your financial limitations.
* **You're nearing the end of negotiation rounds:** This reinforces the urgency for Alice to accept your offer, as you may have to turn to John if no agreement is reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really committed to this price, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $91, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your limit:**  $91 is still more than your $100 limit. 
* **You're running out of rounds:**  You only have three rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to go lower. 
* **John's price is a safe option:** While it's not ideal, John's $100 offer is within your budget and guarantees you'll get the product without further negotiation.

It's a tough decision, as you've come close to your target price. However, with limited rounds and Alice refusing to budge further, it's safer to take John's offer and avoid the risk of losing out entirely."
