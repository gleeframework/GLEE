"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a more reasonable price for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
