Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm also aware that I need to be realistic, so I haven't priced it too high.  I'm open to negotiating further and believe that a deal can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I am willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that is significantly below the product's value to me. I believe I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not ready to sell for less than $800,000 yet. I believe I can secure a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
