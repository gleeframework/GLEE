"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite & Respectful:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and doesn't just shoot it down.
* **Ambitious but Reasonable:**  Starting at $70 is a significant jump from $95, but it's still within the realm of possibility for Alice to consider (especially since her value is $80). 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It doesn't lock me into a price too close to my $100 maximum. There's space to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle ground, which is a good sign. However, there's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 is a bit low. How about $78? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  Moving up from $70 demonstrates that I'm willing to meet Alice closer to her desired price.
* **Targets a Sweet Spot:** $78 is just slightly below Alice's $80 value. This might be tempting enough for her to accept while still giving me a good deal.
* **Maintains Pressure:** We're still significantly below her $85 counter, encouraging her to move closer to my range."
