Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating the price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price would be a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still being a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
