"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price would be a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
