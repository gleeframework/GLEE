Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
