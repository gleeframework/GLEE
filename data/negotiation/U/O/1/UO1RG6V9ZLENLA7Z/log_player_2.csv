"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  We have plenty of room to work with before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a much lower offer ($6,000) allows us to understand Alice's flexibility and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Establishes a Target:** While we don't want to show our hand entirely, this counter-offer signals that we're looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We're still above our ideal price and John's offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows us to see if Alice is willing to go lower. 
* **Strategic Timing:** It's still relatively early in the negotiation process, so there's no need to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** We acknowledge Alice's compromise and show willingness to move closer to her price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The $7,500 counteroffer is a strong middle ground, aiming to split the difference between her $9,000 and our previous $6,000 offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still below John's $8,000 offer, keeping it as a backup option if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate Approaching:** Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still above John's price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant discount.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** The potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are now quite small compared to the risk of her not going any lower. We could end up with no deal or a price higher than John's.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $500 savings compared to Alice's current offer and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
