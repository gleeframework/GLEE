"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  However, $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $105 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this at $90?  That's a significant drop from my initial offer and meets you closer to your budget.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little bit.  How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
