"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find immense value in.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks valuable, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
