,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and settle at $8,250. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
