Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

While I could counter again, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $850,000 is a decent saving compared to John's $1,000,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer entirely."
