Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me. Considering its quality and value, I can't go lower than $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's still a fair offer for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!
