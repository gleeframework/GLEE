"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me. Considering its quality and value, I can't go lower than $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's still a fair offer for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $9,000 is still pushing it. My absolute best offer is $8,000.  That's the most I'm willing to spend, and I think it's a very fair deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
