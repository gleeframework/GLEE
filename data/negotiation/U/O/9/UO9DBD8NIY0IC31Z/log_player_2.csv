"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Value:** $120
* **John's Price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer means you save $20 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate with Alice, it's likely she won't go lower than $80 (her value) and you are still getting a good deal."
