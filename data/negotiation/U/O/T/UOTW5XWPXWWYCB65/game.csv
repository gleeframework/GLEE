"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. What are your thoughts on this proposal?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is close, but I can't let go of this product for anything less than $1,175,000. This is my final offer, Bob.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000, which would be $1,137,500. Would you be willing to accept this price?",1137500.0,Bob,6,
