Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's clear he's very focused on staying below that $1,200,000 mark.  It's time to move on to John who's already agreed to my desired price."
