"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While accepting Alice's offer would get you the product, it's still more expensive than buying it from John.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the better choice."
