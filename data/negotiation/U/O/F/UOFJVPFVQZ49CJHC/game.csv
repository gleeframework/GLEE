"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I believe this product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll find great value in it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $8,500 is still too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $7,000. How about we make it $8,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8000.0,Alice,5,
