"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, while also giving you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you and the value it holds for me.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
