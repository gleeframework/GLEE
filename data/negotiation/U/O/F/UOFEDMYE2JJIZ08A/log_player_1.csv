Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, while also giving you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you and the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
