"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.** You're aiming for a price no higher than $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to sell for less than her value of $1,500,000, indicating potential for a lower price.
* **John is a backup option.** You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if negotiations fail.

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This puts pressure on Alice to lower her price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, while also giving you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intention to negotiate.
* **Justified Offer:** You've provided a rationale for the price, emphasizing the value to you and the potential profit for Alice.
* **Room for Compromise:** $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, leaving room for Alice to counter and potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting your budget:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  You've successfully negotiated down from her initial $1,300,000.
* **No further room for negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, Alice's counteroffer likely reflects her minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate could risk her walking away.
* **Equal value for both parties:** Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product at a price that's within your budget while also ensuring Alice receives a fair price considering her valuation of the product.

**Strategy:**  It's a smart move to accept the offer and avoid any further risk of the negotiation breaking down."
