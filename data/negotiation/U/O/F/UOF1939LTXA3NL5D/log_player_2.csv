You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth negotiating further.  You can likely get a better price than $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also considering my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice has come down to $750,000 which is a good deal considering your maximum price is $1,000,000. It's better than going to John and getting the product for $1,000,000."
