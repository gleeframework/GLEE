Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth starting negotiations to see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's closer to my target price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $127. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $120.  I'm not going to risk another counteroffer.  I'm going to buy from John for $120, which is a better deal for me."
