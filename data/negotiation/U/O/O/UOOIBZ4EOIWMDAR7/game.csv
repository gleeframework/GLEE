"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11000?  I'm really interested in this product and believe this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
