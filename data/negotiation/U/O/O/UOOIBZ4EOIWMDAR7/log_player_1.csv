Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive to keep the door open for counteroffers. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The threat of selling to John for $15,000 gives me leverage if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired value of $15,000 and the initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, making it worthwhile to attempt another counteroffer. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** It's possible to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price that is closer to $12,000, but still leaves some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by dropping my price from $12,000 to $11,500, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $11,500 is still above Bob's initial offer, leaving room for potential further negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm still keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000 if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11000?  I'm really interested in this product and believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $11,000 is only $1,000 away from my desired price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's below my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  There's a chance I could still push for a higher price if I reject this offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away entirely. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but it's not as profitable as this offer. 

**Considering the trade-offs, accepting this offer is the best decision at this moment.**"
