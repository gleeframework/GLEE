Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still keeping you well above your minimum price.
* **Time Value:**  While you have a guaranteed $80 from John, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price might be more advantageous."
