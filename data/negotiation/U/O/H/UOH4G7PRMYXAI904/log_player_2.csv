It's better to reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is way over your budget. You can try to negotiate with Alice or simply buy from John for a better price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a big jump from Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where I'm comfortable if she accepts.  We'll see if she's willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still a significant discount from her last offer. Hopefully, she'll see the value in a deal closer to my budget."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but still higher than what I want to pay.  I'll reject and see if we can close the gap with a final counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer one last time to $1,300,000. This is a significant jump from my last offer, but still below Alice's current offer and closer to my target. It's a final attempt to reach a compromise before I buy from John."

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still over my budget. I'm going to buy from John instead.  It's a guaranteed price that fits my budget, and I'm done with the negotiation!"
