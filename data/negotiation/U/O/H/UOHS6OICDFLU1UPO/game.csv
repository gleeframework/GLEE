"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
