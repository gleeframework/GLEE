"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. $1,000,000 is still a decent amount, but I can likely negotiate for more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm going to try for a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that's fair for both of us. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,075,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go slightly higher, but I think $1,050,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I've already rejected a few offers and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely.  While $1,050,000 is less than I initially hoped for, it's still a good profit."
