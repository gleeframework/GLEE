Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm going to test the waters with a million dollar offer. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'll also keep John in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below a million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in this price and agree, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, the negotiation has gone back and forth, and this is a good profit margin.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away entirely, and I'd be left with only the $800,000 offer from John. It's time to close the deal."
