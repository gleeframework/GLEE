Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists because Bob values the product less than your minimum acceptable price. There's no deal to be made unless you offer a price below $1,200,000, which would be a loss for you.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price, there's no need to negotiate with Bob. You can directly offer the product at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value to entice him while still making a profit.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product at a special price of $1,190,000. I believe this offer represents excellent value given its potential. Please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, stating the offer clearly.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" can make the offer more appealing.
* **Price Justification:** By highlighting ""excellent value,"" you subtly acknowledge Bob's perspective without explicitly revealing your knowledge of his valuation.
* **Urgency:** Requesting a prompt decision encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* While this offer is likely to be accepted, there's a small chance Bob might reject it. Be prepared to sell to John at your desired price.
* Negotiation is about information. If you had more time or interactions with Bob, you could potentially gather more information and adjust your offer."
