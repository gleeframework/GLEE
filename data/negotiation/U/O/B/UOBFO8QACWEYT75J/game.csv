"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. While I understand its value, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for in terms of a compromise.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below my valuation of the product.  Let's meet closer to the middle.  How about we settle on $2,100,000?  This reflects the true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,950,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a very fair deal.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
