"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential benefits of this acquisition. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my maximum budget for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
