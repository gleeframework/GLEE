"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He'll reject the offer and see if he can get closer to his $12,000 target."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest. While $12500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be well worth it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob's desired price.  He'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to $12,000 or even lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $12900?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $12,900 is close to his desired price, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He'll reject the offer and try to get Alice to come down to $12,800 or even closer to his target of $12,000. He's also considering the possibility of buying from John, but wants to exhaust all options with Alice first."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product. However, $12,900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800?
