Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  I have a few rounds left and I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,900?  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for the product. However, $12900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $12800?  I really want to make this deal work, and this would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a bit more, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the next few rounds.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge much more, and if I reject, I risk him walking away."
