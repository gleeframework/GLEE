"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $100, which would be $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
