{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a higher price than your minimum while leaving room for bargaining.  It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiating, $12,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about $13,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
