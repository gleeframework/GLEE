Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be much higher than $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he manages to bring the price down, even if it's still above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your minimum acceptable price and John's offer."
