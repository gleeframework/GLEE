"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since the product is worth no less than $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $15,000 is within my minimum price, I will accept his offer.
