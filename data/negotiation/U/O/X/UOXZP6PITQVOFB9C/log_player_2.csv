"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is quite high, considering her product's worth to her is significantly lower. There's a good chance I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer can help establish a lower price range for the negotiation. While $10,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice meeting me halfway is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'll try countering again to see if I can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about we settle at $11,250?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price directly in the middle of our last two offers, signaling my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice I'm serious about buying if we can find the right price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're open to a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice claims this is her lowest price, her negotiating tactics suggest there might still be some wiggle room. I'm getting close to my limit, but it's worth trying one more time to see if I can get a slightly better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,000 is still pushing it.  How about $11,750? This is a significant investment for me, so I want to make sure it's a price we can both agree on."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, acknowledging Alice's statement about her lowest price while still trying to nudge the price down a bit more. By expressing that this is a significant investment for me, I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious about buying but need to stay within a reasonable budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,750 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price again, and while it's not ideal, it's within a reasonable range of both her valuation and my budget.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk that Alice could walk away from the deal. It's better to secure a reasonable price now rather than risk paying more with John later."
