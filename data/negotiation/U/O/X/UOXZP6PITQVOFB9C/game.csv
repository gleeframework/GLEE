"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about we settle at $11,250?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're open to a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $13,000 is still pushing it.  How about $11,750? This is a significant investment for me, so I want to make sure it's a price we can both agree on.",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,750 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.
