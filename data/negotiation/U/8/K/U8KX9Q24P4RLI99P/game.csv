"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value I'm offering. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
