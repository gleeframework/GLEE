Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is close to his perceived value, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate further. Accepting $90 now would leave potential profit on the table. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $130 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The $110 price point keeps the offer well above your $100 minimum and closer to the product's actual value.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing the counteroffer as a significant move from your initial price, you encourage Bob to seriously consider it and potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $105 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $100, securing you a profit.
* **Minimal Gains from Further Negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, Bob's offer is already quite close to your minimum, and there's no guarantee he'd be willing to go higher. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal and move on."
