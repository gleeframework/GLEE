{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  He's offering $700,000, which is still a good profit for Alice considering her valuation of $800,000. This counteroffer shows he's serious about getting a deal and is willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's showing flexibility while still trying to get a good deal. $750,000 is a good compromise and might be enough to convince Alice, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer.  He's also leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects again."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to $750,000. While $825,000 is better than previous offers, it's still too high for him. He has 5 more rounds to negotiate and can try to reach a more favorable price by making a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer again, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price below $800,000. This is a good compromise and might convince Alice to accept the deal, especially since she's rejected a lower offer in the previous round. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects again, but it's a good strategy to show he's serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the best offer Alice has made so far.  While Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $775,000, he only has three rounds left. Accepting this offer would mean a savings of $687,500 compared to buying from John, which is a huge advantage. There is a chance he could get a better price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is high."
