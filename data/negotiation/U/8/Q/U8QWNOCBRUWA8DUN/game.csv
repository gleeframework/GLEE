"Thank you for the opportunity to purchase this product. I understand its value to you might be high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer closer to the market value. Considering the current market conditions and the product's features, I suggest an offer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1800000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below my minimum price. To move this deal forward, I'm willing to drop my price to $1900000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes both our interests.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
