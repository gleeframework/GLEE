"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a significant profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  We are early in the negotiation, and Bob's counteroffer suggests he is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating, but his offer increments are getting smaller. I need to hold firm to signal the value of the product.  I'm willing to counter, but I'll move less in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant. I can come down slightly to $1,175,000, but that's my best offer.  This is a fair price considering the return you'll see on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down slightly. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is still engaged but his offer increments are small. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than $1,075,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away and secures a strong profit."
