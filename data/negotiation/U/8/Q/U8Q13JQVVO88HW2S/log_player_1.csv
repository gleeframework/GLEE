Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it allows for room to negotiate.  By stating the value of the product and offering a reason to accept, I'm hoping to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm confident that I can push for a better price.  I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Given the significant benefits it offers, I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $960000. I hope this offer is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  while I understand your budget constraints,  $960,000 still doesn't reflect the full potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $965,000. This is my final offer before considering other options."", ""product_price"": 965000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your last offer, Alice. While I understand the value, I would like to propose a price of $962500. I hope this is closer to what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for a significantly lower price is too high. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes risk."
