"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a good offer, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? This would be a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $107.50 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $108.75. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $108.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $106.25, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",106.25,Bob,6,
