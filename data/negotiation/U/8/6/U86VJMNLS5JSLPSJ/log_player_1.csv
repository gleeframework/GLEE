{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price. This makes it more appealing to Bob while still securing a significant profit if he accepts. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't explicitly invited negotiation, this high initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $150."
