"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move on if we can't find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
