"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $9,500, which is better than buying from John for $10,000. 
* However, you can likely negotiate a better price with Alice. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you are not desperate and are willing to consider other options. This increases your bargaining power and could lead to a lower price."
