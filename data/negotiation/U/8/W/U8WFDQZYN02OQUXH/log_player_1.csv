Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Even though Bob only values the product at $8,000, Alice starts with a high offer ($20,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value if he's particularly interested.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest. By mentioning the product's benefits and showing a willingness to negotiate, Alice can get a better sense of whether Bob is willing to pay a price significantly higher than his initial valuation.
* **Safety Net:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) for $15,000. If Bob refuses to negotiate or offers a price significantly lower than $15,000, Alice can confidently walk away knowing she has a secured sale. 

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. It's important to consider if this aligns with Alice's long-term business goals and potential relationship with Bob."
