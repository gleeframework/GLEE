"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's try $12,500 as a compromise.  This is still a great price for a product worth so much to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
