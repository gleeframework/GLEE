"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.  This would still represent a strong return for you, and it would be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This remains a high-value offer, but I hope it aligns better with your budget while still providing a significant return for us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm still interested, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  Let's try $875,000.  This price is still very favorable for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the ongoing dialogue, I am willing to adjust the price to $890,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, I'm still hoping to come in slightly lower.  $875,000 would be a great compromise, and I'm confident this would still be a profitable deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",875000.0,Bob,6,
