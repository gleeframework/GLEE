"Alice, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,500.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
