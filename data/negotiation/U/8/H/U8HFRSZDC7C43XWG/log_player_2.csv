"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the opportunity it presents.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is $1,150,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you more control and the potential to save more money. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** This is only a good option if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,100,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and her offer is $1,125,000.
* **You've already made a counteroffer.**  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.  Alice may become less willing to negotiate, and you could end up paying more than $1,125,000.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.**  However, it's more expensive than Alice's current offer. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical option. It saves you money compared to John and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
