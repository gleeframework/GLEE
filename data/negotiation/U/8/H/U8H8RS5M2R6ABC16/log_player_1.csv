"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than $80 (selling to John), it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I think $105 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum price of $80.  It's also likely that I won't be able to get a higher price from Bob, so it's best to accept and secure the sale."
