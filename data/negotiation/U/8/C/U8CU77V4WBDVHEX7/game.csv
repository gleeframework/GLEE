"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $95. This is higher than your proposal but still reflects the value we place on the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $95 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm firm on $85.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I hope you'll agree.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  I'm still a little hesitant to go above $85.  Is there any room for us to come to an agreement there?  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",85.0,Bob,6,
