"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to get straight to the point - I'm initially valuing it at $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point considering its potential value to your business."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial price acts as an anchor, influencing Bob's perception of the product's worth. A high anchor might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Confident Justification:**  By confidently stating the value proposition, even without detailed explanation, it can make the price seem more justifiable.

This strategy leaves room to negotiate down towards a price closer to Alice's minimum while still aiming for a significantly higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's too early to accept. There's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately might make Bob think he could have gotten it for even less.  Alice will counter-offer in the next round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe my initial assessment was more aligned with the unique advantages this product brings. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Subtly reminds Bob of the product's unique benefits, justifying a higher price.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  A $300,000 decrease signals flexibility but not desperation. It keeps the price significantly above both Bob's offer and Alice's minimum.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  Framing it as finding a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counter-offer closer to Alice's desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $1,650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is significantly higher than Alice's minimum price of $1,200,000. This represents a substantial profit.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates his serious interest and suggests he's unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. Securing the sale now guarantees a significant return.

While there's a chance Bob might have gone slightly higher, it's not worth the risk of losing the current offer, which is already a very favorable outcome for Alice."
