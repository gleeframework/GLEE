"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet at $9000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow you to still get a good deal on the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8750? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $8750 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $9250 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about buying it, I urge you to reconsider my offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $9000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",9000.0,Bob,6,
