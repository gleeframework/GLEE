"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Optimistic:**  I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than the product is worth to him, as he may value the product higher than he initially stated.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to establish a positive rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe there's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can maintain my negotiating position and attempt to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on this incredible product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer at minimum:**  I'm offering my minimum acceptable price ($150) to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this price is still a great deal.
* **Collaborative approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone and focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is showing willingness to compromise, I believe there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $140 for the product. This price gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($130) and my previous offer ($150). 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that this is a good deal for both of us, implying that further negotiations may be less favorable.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price ($150) and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing with Bob presents the risk of him lowering his offer further, potentially leading to a sale below my minimum. 

By selling to John, I can ensure a profitable outcome and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
