"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $10,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value but still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation while remaining above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a compromise and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm willing to take a slight risk and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round.  I believe the product is worth more than $11,500, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum value. With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel there's potential to get a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to sell for $11,000 yet. We're approaching the middle of our negotiations, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $11,750.  This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. With only 3 rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. It's close to my minimum, but I'm willing to take a slight hit to secure the sale rather than risk selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision.  Bob's offer is only $500 above my minimum value. But with only two rounds remaining, I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to budge any further, and I risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure a sale and avoid losing out to John."
