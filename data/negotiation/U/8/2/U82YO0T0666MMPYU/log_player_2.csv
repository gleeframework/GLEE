"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $14,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair price reflecting its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($15,000 vs. $12,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal.**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to explore lower prices. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's your last resort.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so you'll only consider buying from John if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  This is still a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves some room for us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see you're serious about this product.  While $13,500 is a fair starting point, I know the true value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but not enough.**  While she's moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **The middle ground is still above your target.** You're looking to save as much as possible, so accepting at $14,000 would leave you with a less-than-ideal outcome. 
* **You have multiple rounds left.**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You're committed to getting the best price possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
