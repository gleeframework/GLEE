"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Description] for a price that is significantly less than its true worth to you. I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. This represents a substantial savings for you, while still allowing me a fair return on my investment. Consider this a win-win proposition.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
