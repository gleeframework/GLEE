"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you and gives you a significant profit margin. I understand this is a considerable investment, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile one.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $250,000."
