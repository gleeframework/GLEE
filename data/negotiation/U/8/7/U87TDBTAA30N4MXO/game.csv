"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal considering its worth to you. This is my final offer before I pursue other options.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs, and I believe it's a good compromise for us to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
