Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $7,500 offer.  While I'm still hoping for a bit more, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. To be sure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
