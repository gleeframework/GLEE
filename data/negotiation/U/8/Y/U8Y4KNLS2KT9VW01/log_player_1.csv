""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even considering your initial assessment. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below John's guaranteed price creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While $14,000 is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen, potentially leading to a higher sale price than $15,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly reminds Bob that Alice has other options, adding a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
