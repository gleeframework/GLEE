"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable and reflects the product's worth to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $875,000? This would give you a good profit while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is sufficient. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another compromise and propose a price of $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best we can do.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this price, but it's still outside my ideal range.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great way to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $860,000. However, I'm still not willing to budge much from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $887,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,7,
