Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Bob is clearly anchored at $800,000. It's time to try a different tactic to demonstrate the product's value and create some urgency.  We are still far above his valuation, and continuing to simply lower the price might not be effective."

However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to acquire it. I'm willing to let go of it for $1,800,000, but this is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider the other offer on the table."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not budged from his $800,000 offer, and even tried to use your mention of another buyer to his advantage.  It's clear he's unwilling or unable to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to you.  

* **Holding out hope for a significantly higher offer from Bob is unlikely.** He's shown his hand and his valuation is far below yours.
* **You have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John.**  This is significantly better than Bob's offer and ensures you don't lose out by continuing a stalled negotiation.

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed win with John."
