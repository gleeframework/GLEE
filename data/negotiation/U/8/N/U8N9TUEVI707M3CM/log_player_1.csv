Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer.  It's unlikely he will reach $1,500,000 in a reasonable timeframe. Cutting my losses and taking John's offer is the most strategically sound decision at this point."
