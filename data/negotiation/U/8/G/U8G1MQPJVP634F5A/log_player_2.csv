"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of time and effort into, and it's worth at least $10000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500.  This is a great opportunity for you, as it's worth the same to you, and you'll be getting it directly from the creator. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While the product is worth $10,000 to him, Alice is offering it for $10,500.  Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
