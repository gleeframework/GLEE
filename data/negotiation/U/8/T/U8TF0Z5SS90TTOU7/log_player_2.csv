"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a potentially valuable asset. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While she claims the product is worth at least that to her, you have no way to verify this.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John, who is selling for a price within your budget."
