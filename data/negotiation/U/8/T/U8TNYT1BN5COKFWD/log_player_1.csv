{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. I don't mention my own valuation to avoid revealing my hand too early.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high but be realistic:** $1,200,000 is a strong starting point, allowing for potential concessions without jeopardizing my minimum requirement.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This price gives Bob space to counter without feeling like they're being exploited. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob helps build his motivation to close the deal. 

This approach aims to secure a good price while maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic. I'm prepared to make counteroffers and even walk away if needed, but this initial offer sets a strong foundation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** Showing that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price keeps Bob engaged and motivated to negotiate further.
* **Explore higher offers:**  By rejecting, I open the door for Bob to potentially increase his offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  His counteroffer provides insight into his willingness to pay. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point. I'll aim to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial, while still ensuring I achieve a price closer to my $1,500,000 target."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair price while moving closer to your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to maintain some leverage and see if Bob is willing to go higher. 

**Reasons for Rejection:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product's worth.
* **Potential for a Better Offer:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer. I want to see if he's willing to bridge the gap further.
* **Assessing Bob's Seriousness:** His willingness to counteroffer indicates he's genuinely interested in the product.  I want to see how far he's willing to go.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price that is closer to my target but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll aim for a price between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, depending on how I assess Bob's willingness to compromise."

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is designed to:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a common ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This price still keeps us within a reasonable range for both parties, and I believe it will be beneficial for us to close the deal at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my desired price, it's now very close to my last counteroffer of $1,150,000. Considering the following:

* **Potential for Stalemate:** Further negotiation may lead to a stalemate, where we keep going back and forth without reaching an agreement.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $1,500,000,  a deal with Bob at $1,100,000 is still a significant gain for me and more likely to be finalized.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob's continued engagement and willingness to counter shows his seriousness in acquiring the product.

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 secures a good price, finalizes the transaction, and avoids the risk of further negotiation that may not lead to a better outcome."
