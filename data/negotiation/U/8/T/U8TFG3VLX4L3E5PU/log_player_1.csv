Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This means any price Bob accepts above $800,000 is profit.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, further negotiation might be necessary."
