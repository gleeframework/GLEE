"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary. This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is equal to John's offer, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and a better price. I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable margin. This offer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly closer to my desired price point. While I'd still prefer a higher amount, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and secures a sale."
