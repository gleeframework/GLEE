{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm confident it will be valuable to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. Let's discuss and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  Even though Bob is a potential buyer,  $1,200,000 is too low. It's better to try to negotiate a higher price or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to make this deal work. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum price point.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the maximum value without risking losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
