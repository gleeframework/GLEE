"I'm willing to consider the product, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for a product like this. Can you meet me in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1400000. Let's meet in the middle at $1450000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1450000.0,Alice,3,,
