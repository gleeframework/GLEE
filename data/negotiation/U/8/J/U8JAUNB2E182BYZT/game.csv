"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the information about its value to you. However, I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you've expressed it has to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $825000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering both of our interests.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
