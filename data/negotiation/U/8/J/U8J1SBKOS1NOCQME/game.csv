"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value you've outlined, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  While I understand your position, this product holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the sale.",800000.0,Bob,4,
