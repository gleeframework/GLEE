"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe it's a bit pricey at $14000, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
