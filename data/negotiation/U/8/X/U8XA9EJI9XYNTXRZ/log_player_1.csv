"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since I have 8 more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a compromise that is closer to my desired price point, but still potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it. This ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
