Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  This eliminates the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By starting at your ideal price, you leave room for negotiation if Bob counters. He may be willing to pay more than $800,000, especially if you effectively communicate the product's value.
* **Confidence:** Presenting a firm, high initial offer can convey the product's value and your seriousness about the sale. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as scarce or highly valuable to his specific needs.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter your offer. Have a strategy for potential concessions while keeping your bottom line in mind."
