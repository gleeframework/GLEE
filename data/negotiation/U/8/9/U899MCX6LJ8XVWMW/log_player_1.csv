Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $120, but I'm willing to negotiate with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $100. This is still above his initial offer, but closer to a point where we might be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $85 is simply too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, which John is already willing to pay.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
