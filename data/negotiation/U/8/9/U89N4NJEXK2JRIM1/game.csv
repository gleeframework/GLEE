"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a workable agreement, that price point doesn't quite reflect the product's true value.  Could you consider $1,700,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to achieve a positive outcome.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
