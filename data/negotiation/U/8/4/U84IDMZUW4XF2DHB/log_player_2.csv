"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $12,000. I'm offering it to you for $12,500.  Let me know what you think. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down in price or move on to her other potential buyer."
