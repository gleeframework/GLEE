Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly lower than your floor price of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives Bob a potential gain of $4,000 and leaves you with a profit of $14,000. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential of maximizing your profit. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your desired price."
