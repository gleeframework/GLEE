Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I recognize its value, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $8,000, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
