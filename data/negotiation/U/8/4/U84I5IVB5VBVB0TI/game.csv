"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product at a very competitive price of $1100000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1050000.  This price still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit further, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $975000 is still below my minimum acceptable offer.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more and offer the product for $1012500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to come to an agreeable price. Please consider this final offer, as I'm not sure I can go any lower.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1012500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $995000, but no higher. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.",995000.0,Bob,6,
