Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant reduction from my initial offer. I hope this compromise encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price while still being reasonable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm choosing to accept his offer, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, who is willing to pay $12,000."
