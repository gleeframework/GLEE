"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob but significantly lower than my minimum price.
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers without immediately reaching my minimum price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below the product's worth to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I still have 8 rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Drop:**  I'm dropping my price from $12,000 to $9,000, showing flexibility but still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This offer emphasizes finding a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Incentive:** $9,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer, motivating him to potentially counter with a higher number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob is increasing his offer, $6,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my goal.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I still have several rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution we're both comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $8,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price Emphasis:**  I emphasize that $8,000 is a fair price considering the product's value, reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a mutually acceptable solution, encouraging Bob to consider my offer."
