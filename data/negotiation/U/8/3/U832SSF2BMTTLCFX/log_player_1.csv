This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for you to negotiate further if needed.
* **It provides a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond accordingly."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While it is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider an offer closer to my budget. My latest counteroffer is $1,060,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's very close. I'm willing to accept it as a compromise. Continuing negotiations could lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on the deal."
