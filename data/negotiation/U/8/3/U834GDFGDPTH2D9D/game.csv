"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
