{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least $150 from John, so I have some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $150 yet. I will try to counteroffer and see if I can get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. This is still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $152. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $160, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $152 is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not ideal, but it's still a good deal considering I could sell to John for $150.  I'll accept Bob's offer to close the deal."
