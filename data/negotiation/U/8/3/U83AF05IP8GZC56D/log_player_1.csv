Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential return on investment, justifying the high price.

By setting the initial offer high but reasonable, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting Outright:**  Bob might see the deal as fair and accept immediately.
2. **Successful Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice has room to negotiate down slightly and still secure a price significantly higher than her backup offer from John."
