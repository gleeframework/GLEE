"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,100,000?  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,090,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
