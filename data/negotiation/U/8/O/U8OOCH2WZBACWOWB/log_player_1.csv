Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested, this offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower, there's room for negotiation.  A high starting price anchors the negotiation in my favor.
* **Creating Urgency:** The 24-hour limit encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially leading to a faster sale.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and benefits"" subtly implies the price is justified without directly revealing my bottom line.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This framing makes Bob feel special and potentially more open to the higher price.

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts, and I get a great price above my minimum.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates, and we potentially settle closer to $17,000-$18,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects, and I sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
