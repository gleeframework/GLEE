"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not yet willing to settle for that, especially since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle.  I have more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm hoping to secure at least $1 million to make this deal worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1 million. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower figure.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $987,500. This is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to get closer to $1 million, Bob's offer of $987,500 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's risky to continue rejecting offers. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
