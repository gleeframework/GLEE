Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Opening:** $150 is a reasonable starting point, not overly aggressive.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation with a question rather than just stating a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $120?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **No Further Upward Potential:** There's no room to negotiate for a higher price, as John is also willing to pay $120.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures a quick sale."
