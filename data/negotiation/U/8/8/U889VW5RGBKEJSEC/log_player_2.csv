"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500 for the product. This is still below his maximum price of $8,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between his target price and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  Even though it's lower than her first offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should keep negotiating with Alice to try and get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but still wants a price that's closer to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still not worth it for him. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation.  It's better to just buy from John and avoid any further risk of Alice not accepting a counteroffer."
