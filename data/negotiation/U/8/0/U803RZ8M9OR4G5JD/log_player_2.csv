"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option."
