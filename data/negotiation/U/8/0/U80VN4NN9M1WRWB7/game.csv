"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",105.0,Bob,4,
