Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs.  My asking price is $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a friendly way, highlighting the product's value and making it seem like a fair deal. 

**Strategy:**

* By starting with a higher price, I can potentially leave room for negotiation and secure a higher price than Bob's initial valuation.
* If Bob rejects, I can consider his counteroffer, taking into account John's offer of $15,000. This allows me to weigh my options and choose the best deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. This will allow me to test the waters and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price point. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to make a profit while still being within your price range."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my offer to $13,500, which is a significant move towards Bob's offer but still above his initial counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm positioning my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise that could potentially entice Bob to close the deal. 
* I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive relationship and avoid pushing Bob away.
* I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed, but I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still can't go above $12,000. Would you be open to discussing this further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his initial offer of $12,000, which is well below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made a significant concession by dropping my price to $13,500, and it appears that further negotiation won't result in a satisfactory price. 

Given that John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to him. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
