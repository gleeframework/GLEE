"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $14000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay closer to $12500, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $13,500.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.

While Bob might still prefer a lower price, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price from Alice or a decision to buy from John at $15,000 makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
