"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a strategic move. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price. If he rejects, I can lower the price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I still think this price is fair considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial price, it's getting late in the negotiations. I'm happy with $17,000, especially as it is above my minimum value.  It's also better than selling to John for $15,000."
