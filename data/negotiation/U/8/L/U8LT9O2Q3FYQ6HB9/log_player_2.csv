"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **John's Price:** $150 
* **Your Value:** $150

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $150 to John, which is still within your budget. However, it's the best outcome as it allows you to save $10 compared to Alice's offer."
