"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This price still represents a good value for you, and allows me to get a bit closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $10,375? This allows us both to come closer to our desired price.  Let me know what you think.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,187.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price.",10187.5,Bob,6,
