Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than his first offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This price still represents a good value for you, and allows me to get a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $10,375? This allows us both to come closer to our desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10375}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,187.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can agree to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,187.5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get even closer to my desired price,  the negotiation has taken several rounds and we're getting closer to the end.  I don't want to risk running out of time and ending up with a lower offer. John provides a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
