"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1200000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and hopefully reflects its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000. However, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for me, I'd need to stick to my original offer of $800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $800000, which is $900000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
