"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price from Alice.  $900,000 is still a hefty profit for her.  A counteroffer will allow you to explore a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $850,000. This is a good price for you - you're still saving $350,000 compared to buying from John. There's always the possibility of negotiating further, but the risk is that she'll reject your offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
