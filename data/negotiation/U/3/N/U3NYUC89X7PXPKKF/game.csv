"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which would still allow you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
