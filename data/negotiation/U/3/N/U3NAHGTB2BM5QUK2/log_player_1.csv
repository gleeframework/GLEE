This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a nice round number that's easy to remember."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
