"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows you are serious about selling to Bob but also willing to compromise.  

I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and start the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
