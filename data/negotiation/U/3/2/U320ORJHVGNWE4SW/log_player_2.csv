"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($110 < $150).**
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** While Bob initially offered $100, Alice offered $110, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  Bob could reject and counter again, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  There's also the risk of running out of rounds.

At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations or losing time."
