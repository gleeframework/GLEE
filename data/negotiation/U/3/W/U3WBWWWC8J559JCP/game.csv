"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being attractive to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,037,500? This would give us both a fair price and allow us to close this deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,037,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 5% discount on the price, making it $967,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",967500.0,Bob,6,
