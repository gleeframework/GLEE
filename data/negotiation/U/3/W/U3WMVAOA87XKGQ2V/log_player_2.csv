"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make it a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has started at her maximum price. There's no point in accepting this offer or buying from John at the same price.  I should counter-offer significantly lower to see if there's any room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, there's still potentially room for negotiation. I will reject this offer and propose something slightly below her current price to test the waters further."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While I might be able to push her a tiny bit further, the potential savings are not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. Accepting $950,000 is a significant discount from her initial price and a good deal overall."
