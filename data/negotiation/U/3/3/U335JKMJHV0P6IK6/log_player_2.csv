Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000, which still reflects the value of the product to both of us.  This would allow you a good profit margin while also allowing me to recoup a significant portion of my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price, but I'm still unable to go below $925,000.  This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this product will be highly profitable for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

The negotiation is getting close, but you are running out of rounds. You are confident you could negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee she will accept your final counteroffer. It's best to avoid the risk and buy from John, who is offering a much better deal at $800,000."
