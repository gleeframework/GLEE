I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm not yet ready to sell for that price. I'm still hopeful I can secure a better deal with Bob or even John, if I have to."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I was hoping to get a better deal with Bob, I'm worried we're getting too far apart in our valuations. I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John completely."
