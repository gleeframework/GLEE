Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher initially allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the offer as valuable and time-sensitive.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can gradually lower the price, ultimately reaching a figure that's still more profitable than my guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a calculated risk. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate and I lower the price too slowly, I risk losing him as a buyer. However, the potential for higher profit makes this a risk worth taking."
