Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob while still leaving you with a substantial profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $1,200,000 to my previous offer of $1,400,000. It shows willingness to negotiate while still achieving a profitable sale."
