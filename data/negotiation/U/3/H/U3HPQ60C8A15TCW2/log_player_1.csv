Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While the product is only worth $120 to Bob, starting at $200 leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it sets a high anchor point.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counters, it means he's at least somewhat interested. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $140 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($120). This suggests there's room for negotiation, and I might be able to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **John as Leverage:**  I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John. Accepting $140 would be a loss compared to that.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I believe the product is worth more. I'll need to counter with a price that shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (ish):** This counteroffer aims for a price closer to my minimum while still acknowledging Bob's initial offer. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By coming down from $200 to $170, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and well above my guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $155 is more profitable than selling to John for $150.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting a solid offer now allows me to move on to other potential sales."
