This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's attractive to Bob, while still leaving room for potential gains for me.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price appealing, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to counter-offer and negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This should be a fair compromise that encourages Bob to accept."

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on any potential profit.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
