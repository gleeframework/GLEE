Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,400. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.

Alice is not budging and is unlikely to go below $14,000.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $15,000. You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals come from knowing when to walk away."
