"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit away. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,200 and my previous offer. How about $13,700? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",13700.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  $13,400 is my final offer. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John.",13400.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,400. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,9,
