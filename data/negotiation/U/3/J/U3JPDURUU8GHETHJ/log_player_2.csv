"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this exclusive offer to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting, he can likely get a better price. He has a strong bargaining position with the option to buy from John for $8,000.  Let's see if he can get closer to that price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. In light of that, I'd like to extend a counteroffer of $9000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and I believe it provides a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still closer to his target price of $8,000 by buying from John. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he can likely get a better price if he continues to push."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm really determined to purchase this product, and I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you're still keen on purchasing the product. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a counteroffer of $9250. This price takes into account both the value of the product and your budget considerations. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While the negotiation is ongoing, Alice's counteroffers are not getting close enough to Bob's desired price point. He's only two rounds away from the final round, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to his target price in that time. 

It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through."
