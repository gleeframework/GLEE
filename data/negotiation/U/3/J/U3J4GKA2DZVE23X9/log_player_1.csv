"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is aggressive but leaves room for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for a back-and-forth without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I have 8 rounds left, which is plenty of time to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $1,000,000 is my new offer. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer signals that I'm willing to compromise but am not desperate for a quick sale.  By focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution, I'm hoping to build trust and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,000,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  The negotiation is moving in the right direction, and I have 6 rounds remaining.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John now would guarantee a significantly higher price, but I'm hoping to extract more value from this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slight decrease in price, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin. I believe this price is attractive to Bob as it's closer to his previous offer, and it leaves a small space for further negotiation if needed.  By emphasizing finding a middle ground and expressing confidence in reaching an agreement, I aim to keep the negotiation positive and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my target price, I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal. 

* **Selling to John:**  While $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to that price with Bob.  
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I've been consistent in my willingness to compromise, and I'm confident Bob will continue to move in the right direction.  I'm hoping to reach a price in the $950,000 - $975,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $950,000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalise the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Confidence & Finality:**  I'm expressing confidence that this is a fair and final price. I want to convey that I'm not willing to negotiate much further, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Emphasizing Benefits:**  I'm reminding Bob that this price is beneficial for both of us, and that we can ""finalise the deal.""

By continuing to negotiate while staying firm on my price, I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob while maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, so how about $937,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting tense. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to feel the pressure. 

* **Risk of Lower Price:** If I continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob will not budge further, and I'll be forced to accept a price lower than I'd like.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than anything I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.
* **Time is Money:** I've spent eight rounds already, and there's a risk that I won't be able to reach a satisfactory deal with Bob in the remaining time. 

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and move on."
