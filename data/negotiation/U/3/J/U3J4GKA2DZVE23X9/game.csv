"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $1,000,000 is my new offer. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $1,000,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $950,000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalise the deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $950,000, so how about $937,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",937500.0,Bob,8,
