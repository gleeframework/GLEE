"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to you. Considering its value to you, I would like to propose a price of $85 for it. I hope this offer aligns well with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $85 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our ongoing dialogue, I am willing to adjust my offer to $80 for the product. I hope this proposal works better for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget.  You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and she's shown a willingness to lower her price. It's worth seeing if you can get it down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $80 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $78 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. After considering your last offer, I believe we can reach an agreement. I am willing to sell the product for $79. I hope this price suits your budget and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $79, which is within your budget and a great deal considering the product's value to you.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $100 is too high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
