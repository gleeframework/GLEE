"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value for the product.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get more if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I want to show him I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $5 below my initial offer and $5 above my minimum. It's a good deal, and I'm not sure I'll get a better one with further negotiation.  I'm going to accept and close the deal."
