{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but also demonstrates Bob's serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob can still aim for a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to his desired range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. He is increasing his offer slightly, showing his willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price below $1 million. This strategy aims to incentivize Alice to accept the offer while still saving Bob a significant amount of money."
