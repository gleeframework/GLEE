Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum desired price. This allows for potential negotiation while leaving room for me to accept a counteroffer that is still profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's not worth selling at such a low price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but is a significant reduction from my previous offer. It signals my willingness to negotiate but also maintains a price that is closer to my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where it's more beneficial to sell to John for my minimum desired price.  It's important to recognize that I'm not obligated to continue negotiating with Bob, and I'm always free to choose the best option for me."
