{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential bargain. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  Mentioning the product's ""unique value proposition"" subtly hints at its desirability and the fact that I have other options if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John."
