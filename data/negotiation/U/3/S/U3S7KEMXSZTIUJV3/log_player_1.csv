Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $180 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still aiming for a profit above my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides me with confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $160. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (still leaving room for both sides to be happy), making it more persuasive. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dropping the price even further and potentially ending up with a deal that is unprofitable for me.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirement.  

It's better to take the sure thing with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
