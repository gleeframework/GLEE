"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original asking price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
