Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a price of $15,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident language:**  Using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" emphasizes the product's worth, potentially encouraging Bob to accept a higher price. 
* **Safety net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always rely on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while minimizing risk."
