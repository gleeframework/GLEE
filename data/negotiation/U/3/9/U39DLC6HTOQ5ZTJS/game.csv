"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800000 to you and it allows me to gain a good amount of capital. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you considering your value for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $950000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering you value it at $1500000 and I'm already willing to pay over my initial goal. Let's make this deal happen.",980000.0,Bob,6,
