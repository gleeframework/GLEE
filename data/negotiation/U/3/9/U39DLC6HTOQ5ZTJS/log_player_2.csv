"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800000 to you and it allows me to gain a good amount of capital. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and counteroffer. You have a significant negotiating advantage because you know Alice values the product much higher than you do."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.  You can likely get it for lower by continuing to negotiate.  While you could buy from John now for $800,000, you're in a better position to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
