You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,175,000 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still a bit high. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower if you continue to negotiate. You're still better off trying to get a lower price than buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and the chances of getting a better price are getting slim. It's better to buy from John and avoid further haggling, especially since you are already so close to your limit."
