Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profits. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle. There's still potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit.  $1,250,000 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it.  The potential gains from further negotiation might not outweigh the risk of Bob walking away completely or delaying the sale.  $1,100,000 is a good deal for me, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
