I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my initial ask. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is worth more than what he's offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not convinced he's truly interested in paying a fair price. I'm happy to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and within my acceptable range."
