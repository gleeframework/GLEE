"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100. There's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
