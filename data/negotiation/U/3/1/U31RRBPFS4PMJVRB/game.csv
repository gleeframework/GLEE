"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'll meet you at $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $15500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $14750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to meet you at $14750, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $15250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15250 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $14500?",14500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $15250, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. This is my final offer. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $15250. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I think I'll try to find the product from John for $8000 instead.",8000.0,Bob,10,
