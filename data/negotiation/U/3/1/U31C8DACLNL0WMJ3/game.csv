"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $800,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",790000.0,Alice,5,
