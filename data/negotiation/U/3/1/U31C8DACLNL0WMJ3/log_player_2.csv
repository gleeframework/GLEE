# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are likely minimal.  $790,000 is a good price and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiations falling apart."
