Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This allows for negotiation space.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the benefits for Bob (""great deal"", ""very useful""). This creates a more positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard deadline, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants. 
* **John as a Backstop:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, which provides a safety net and limits my risk.

I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $150, but I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **John provides a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.  This allows me to take a more aggressive stance with Bob.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I can use John's offer as leverage to push Bob closer to my desired price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to a counteroffer. I want to see if I can bring Bob up to a more acceptable price point before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $120 is still above Bob's offer of $100 but lower than my initial offer of $130. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that the deal is still ""great"" for Bob, emphasizing the perceived value of the product for him.
* **Reasoning for the price:**  I provide a brief explanation for the price to make it seem more justified.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion, indicating flexibility. 

I'm hoping Bob will be swayed by this counteroffer and agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above $100. I appreciate your flexibility, and I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unchanged:**  Bob has remained steadfast at $100, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John is the better option:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is much closer to my desired price and ensures I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially lowering my final price.

Given these factors, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This maximizes my profit and ensures a favorable outcome."
