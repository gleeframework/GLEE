# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is below your maximum price of $120, so it's a good deal. There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the opportunity to buy at this price."
