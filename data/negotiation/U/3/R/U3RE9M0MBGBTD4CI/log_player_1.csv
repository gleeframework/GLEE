``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a significant amount of money. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price to reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with my financial capabilities while still reflecting the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.  It's in my best interest to accept and secure the sale."
