Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking $820,000 is a reasonable price for this product. I'd like to stick with that offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product compared to its worth to him ($1,000,000). While his offer is increasing, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're not in a desperate situation yet where selling to John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $820,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and firmness to the negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a smaller concession this round to signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Still Above Reserve:**  $875,000 is a strong price, well above my minimum acceptable point and leaves Bob with a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $830,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to go up from my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While we could try to push for more, the potential gains at this point are relatively small. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer beyond this point.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Accepting now secures a very good price ($830,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further dragging out the negotiation.  
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option to sell to John for $800,000, but accepting Bob's offer provides a $30,000 premium.  

It's a good deal and time to close the sale!"
