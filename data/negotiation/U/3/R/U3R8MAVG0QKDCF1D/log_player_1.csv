Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more than $80 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, giving Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you having to drop your price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. This is closer to my budget while still allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer $95, $92 is still a decent profit for me and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept Bob's offer."
