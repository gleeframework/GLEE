"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $775,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $775,000 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I need to stay above $850,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500?",862500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, but $862,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll counter with $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",825000.0,Bob,6,
