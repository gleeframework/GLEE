"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. To ensure we both find a satisfactory solution, I am proposing a price of $90 for the product. This allows some room for both of us while ensuring I receive a fair value for the item. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
