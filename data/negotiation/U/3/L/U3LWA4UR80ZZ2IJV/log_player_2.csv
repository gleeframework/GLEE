"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum and still above what you're willing to pay. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better deal."
