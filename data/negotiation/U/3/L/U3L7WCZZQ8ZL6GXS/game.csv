"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
