"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet your price of $9000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal that's very close to what you're looking for.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $12000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,6,
