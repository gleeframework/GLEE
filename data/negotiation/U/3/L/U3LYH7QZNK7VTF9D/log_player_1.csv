""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,999. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a high price close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) aims to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is high, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating. He might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John.
* **Alternative Buyer Provides Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value ($8,000). There's a chance he might find the initial price too high.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A high starting price could lead to Bob immediately rejecting the offer, meaning you miss out on any potential profit above $15,000. However, it also gives you the best chance to secure the highest possible price."
