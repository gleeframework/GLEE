"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's asking price ($9,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. We want to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ideal outcome is to pay closer to Alice's value ($8,000) to maximize our savings compared to John's offer ($10,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to her true value ($8,000) by lowering her price to $8,500. This indicates we have room for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  We still have John's offer ($10,000) as a safety net, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's current offer.
* **Aim for Savings:**  By continuing to negotiate, we can try to secure the product closer to $8,000 and maximize our savings."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $8,200?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($8,500) and our previous counteroffer ($7,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, suggesting a price and framing it as a mutually beneficial compromise. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As we're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, proposing a more reasonable offer increases the chances of a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only came down $100 from her last offer. This suggests she's getting close to her bottom line, but we might be able to squeeze out a bit more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With 5 rounds remaining, we have some room to push for a lower price. However, the potential savings are getting smaller, so we need to be mindful of the risk of Alice walking away.
* **Next Move is Key:** Our next counteroffer should signal that we're serious but also getting close to our limit. We want to encourage Alice to settle."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  I'm willing to offer $8,300 to get this done today.  If that works for you, let's wrap this up!"",
""product_price"": 8300
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase, Clear Intent:**  We're only slightly increasing our offer by $100, signaling that we're serious about buying but not willing to move much higher. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes wanting to ""wrap this up,"" subtly introducing a time pressure element to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a calculated risk. It might be acceptable to Alice, securing us a good deal.  If she rejects it, we'll need to decide how much more we're willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I've already given you a significant discount from my initial price, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice explicitly stated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The potential savings of getting the price lower are outweighed by the increasing risk of losing the deal.  A $600 saving ($8,400 vs. $9,000) is significant.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate increases the likelihood of reaching the round limit and defaulting to John's less favorable offer."
