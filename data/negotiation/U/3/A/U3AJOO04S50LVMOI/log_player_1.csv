Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I know John will buy it for $15,000, which acts as my ""safety net"".  I'm not desperate, so I can afford to aim high with Bob."
