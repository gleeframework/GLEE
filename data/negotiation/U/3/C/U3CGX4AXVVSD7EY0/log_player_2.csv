# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even at $1,200,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money while still obtaining the product."
