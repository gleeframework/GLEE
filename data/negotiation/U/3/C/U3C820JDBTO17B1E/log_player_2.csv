"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you know you have a fallback option with John. There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20%) demonstrates a strong desire to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range. This initial counteroffer allows for room to compromise in future rounds while also gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your desired range.  You've already shown willingness to negotiate and there's a good chance she'll lower her price further.  There are still 7 rounds left, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiations and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the middle of the negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still above my target price.  Increasing my counteroffer by $1000 shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a more measured increase than the initial $3000 drop, and we'll see if she's willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within my acceptable range.  While I would prefer to get a lower price,  we are now at the midpoint of the negotiation. It's important to consider:

* **Time:**  We've already had several rounds, and with only 5 rounds left, the risk of reaching a stalemate increases. 
* **Risk:** If I continue to reject, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, and we might end up paying the full $15,000 to John.

By accepting the offer, I secure a decent deal and avoid further negotiation risks."
