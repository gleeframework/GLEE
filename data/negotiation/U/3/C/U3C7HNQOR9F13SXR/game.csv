"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply isn't a price I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the value of the product to me. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $900,000 is still not quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, which is a bit above my initial offer, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're working within a budget, but $920,000 is still a little low for me. Let's meet halfway again and agree on $935,000. This price represents a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",935000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $910,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both determined to find a solution.  I'm willing to come down one last time to $925,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, and that's my final offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",915000.0,Bob,10,
