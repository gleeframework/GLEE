"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but your price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $11000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my limits.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you $12500, which is still a good deal for you, and gets me closer to my target price. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
