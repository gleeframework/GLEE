{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but your price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $13000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob has two options:

* **Accept:** This would result in Bob spending more than he's willing to.
* **Buy from John:**  This would allow Bob to buy the product at his desired price point.

Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my limits.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you $12500, which is still a good deal for you, and gets me closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  Bob has several options:

* **Accept:** This would result in Bob spending more than he's willing to.
* **Reject and counteroffer:** It's unclear if Alice will budge further, and there are only 5 rounds left, potentially leaving Bob with less bargaining power.
* **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob gets the product for his maximum price point, ensuring he doesn't overspend.

Since Bob prioritizes saving money, the most logical choice is to purchase from John and end the negotiations with Alice."
