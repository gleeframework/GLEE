"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm offering it to you for $200.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $200, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I emphasize my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to engage in the process.
* **Highlight Value:**  While I don't know what Bob values the product at, I'm positioning it as a ""great deal"" to potentially increase his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""room for both of us to be happy""), making it more persuasive.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  I'm still above my minimum price of $150, so I can comfortably negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $140 is still below my floor of $150.
* **Potential for a deal:**  Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate seriously, making a counteroffer worth exploring.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $150, giving me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your seriousness. I'm willing to go down to $155, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making a clear statement that $155 is my final price.  This shows I'm serious about closing a deal.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing $155 as ""fair"" for both of us, which can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Covering Costs:** I'm emphasizing my need to cover costs to reinforce the legitimacy of the price.
* **Focus on Closing:** I'm asking for a clear answer (""Let me know if that works for you"") to try and get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $152.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $152.50 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and I have already made my final offer in the previous round. 
* **Limited Time:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds (6 out of 10).
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a good backup, Bob's offer is slightly better. It's worth taking this deal rather than risking losing both."
