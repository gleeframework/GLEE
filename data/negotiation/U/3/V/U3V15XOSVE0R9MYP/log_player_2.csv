"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great addition to my needs."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** A $2,000 drop is a significant reduction but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and focused on mutual benefit.
* **Value Proposition:** Reinforcing the product's value to Bob helps Alice see the potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's getting close to his maximum price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiations dragging on or Alice backing out entirely."
