"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,012,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
