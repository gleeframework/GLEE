Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" rather than just the price. This attempts to frame Bob's thinking around a higher potential worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. This makes a potential agreement more likely than an outrageously high, non-negotiable price.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
