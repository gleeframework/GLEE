"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe this product will greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $15000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $18000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd be willing to pay $17500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $19000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $19000. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet here.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $18000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $17500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",17500.0,Alice,7,
