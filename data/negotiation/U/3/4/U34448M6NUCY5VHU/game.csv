"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still outside my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price.  However, I value our conversation and am willing to make a final offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  To be fair, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price is within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
