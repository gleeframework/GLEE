"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $15,000 for the product, as that's my current budget. ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still very interested in the product, but  $16,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle on $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I can do $16,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still not quite at $16,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $15,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can close the deal at that price.",15750.0,Bob,6,
