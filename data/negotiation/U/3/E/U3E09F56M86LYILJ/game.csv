"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $7,750? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too low.  Let's aim for something closer to $8,250. That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you, and it's also closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
