"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding the $1,000,000 you perceive it to be worth. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise from both sides, and I believe it's a fair price for this transaction. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. To show some flexibility on my end, I'm willing to come down to $885,000.  I think this reflects the true value of the product and presents a win-win for both of us.",885000.0,Alice,5,
