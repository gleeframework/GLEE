Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob is still well under his perceived value. We have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
