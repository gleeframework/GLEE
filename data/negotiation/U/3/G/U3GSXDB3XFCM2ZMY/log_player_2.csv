"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but I'd need to come in a bit lower to make this work.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation may not yield much savings:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise:**  The offer of $1,100,000 represents a compromise from both parties' initial positions. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,100,000 is the most sensible decision for Bob, as it saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
