"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but I'd need to come in a bit lower to make this work.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford right now.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
