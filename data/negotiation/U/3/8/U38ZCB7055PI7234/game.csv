"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",8750.0,Alice,3,
