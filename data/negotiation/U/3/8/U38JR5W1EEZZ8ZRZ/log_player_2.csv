"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the price I'm willing to pay, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. This signals my serious intent to buy but also sets a clear boundary. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, giving us room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can secure a price closer to $800,000. If Alice refuses to budge, I'll purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it's closer to her desired price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still higher than I'd like, it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and only $300,000 more than John's price.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price to avoid the risk of further negotiations.  It's also worth noting that Alice has demonstrated some flexibility, which suggests a potential for a successful transaction."
