"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it can generate significant value for you. My asking price is $1,800,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This offer still allows for a substantial profit for you, while acknowledging the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a big leap for me. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $700,000.  If you're willing to work within that range, I'm confident we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear your budget constraints. However, $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This price point is still fair considering the potential benefits for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your ideal price and your fallback option.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're happy with within the remaining rounds. Taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John makes the most sense."
