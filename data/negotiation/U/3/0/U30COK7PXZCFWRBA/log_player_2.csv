"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,600,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and its potential benefits, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my valuation for this product. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This represents a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,450,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too high for Bob. He should keep negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his budget or even lower.  He can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
