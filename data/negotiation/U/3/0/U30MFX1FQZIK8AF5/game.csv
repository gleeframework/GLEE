"Bob, thanks for countering. I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $130.  Would you be willing to do $145?",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $140. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider my other options.",140.0,Bob,6,
