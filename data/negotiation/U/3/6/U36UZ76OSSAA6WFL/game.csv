"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
