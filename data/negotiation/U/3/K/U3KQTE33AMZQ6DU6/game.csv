"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's a bit steep at $1,750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000 to reflect your interest. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,550,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
