"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start our negotiation at $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'm thinking of $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of $11500. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's quality and features.",11500.0,Alice,7,
