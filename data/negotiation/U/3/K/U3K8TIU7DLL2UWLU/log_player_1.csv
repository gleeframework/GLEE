"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a better starting position. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $140, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $145 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $150 with some more negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I value our negotiation, I'm still not able to go below $150. This is my absolute minimum, and it's a price I'm confident you'll find fair given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 150}
