"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1350000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1375000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to agree to $1375000. Would it be possible to consider $1360000 as a fair compromise?",1360000.0,Bob,4,
