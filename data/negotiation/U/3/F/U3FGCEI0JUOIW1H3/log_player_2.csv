Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,200.  I'm going to be upfront: $10,200 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up just a little more, to $10,800? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and it's still well within your stated value for the product. Let's try to close this deal - I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.
