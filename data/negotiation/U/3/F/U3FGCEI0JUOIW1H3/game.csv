"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? This price is still within your stated value for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. Can you meet me at this price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,200.  I'm going to be upfront: $10,200 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up just a little more, to $10,800? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and it's still well within your stated value for the product. Let's try to close this deal - I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $10,200. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10200.0,Bob,6,
