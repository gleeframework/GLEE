{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value but lower than your minimum:**  This creates room for negotiation without instantly rejecting Bob. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands exactly what you're proposing.

Let's see how Bob responds before deciding on the next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120.  I want to see if I can get closer to that.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $95 is a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price and emphasizing Bob's satisfaction helps build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which would be $87.50. Would you be open to considering that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum price of $120 than Bob's previous offer, it's still not quite there.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $92.50. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** Offering $92.50 shows I'm willing to compromise while still holding a firm stance on my minimum price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasizing the ""great price"" and ""confidence in Bob's satisfaction"" maintains a positive tone during negotiation.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** Asking ""What do you say?"" directly encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept."
