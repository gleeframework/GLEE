"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, which would be $87.50. Would you be open to considering that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $92.50. This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
