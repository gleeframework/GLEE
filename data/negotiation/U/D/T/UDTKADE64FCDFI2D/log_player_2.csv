"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer allows for further price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $760000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $760,000, which is only $10,000 away from your last counteroffer. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated or walking away is increasing.  

Considering the price is already significantly lower than John's offer, it's strategically sound to accept Alice's offer and secure the product. You'll save $240,000 compared to John's price, making this the best option."
