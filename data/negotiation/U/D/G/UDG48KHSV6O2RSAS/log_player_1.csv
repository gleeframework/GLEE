Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an alternative of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects the value this product holds for both of us. It's a fair price that allows us both to gain something from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still need to stick to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $960,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000, as this deal would allow me to keep more of the profit for myself."
