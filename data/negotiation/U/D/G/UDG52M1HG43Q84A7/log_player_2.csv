"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While you could reject hoping for a lower price, there's a risk Alice won't budge much further. Buying from John would cost you the full $1,500,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
