"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $980000.

This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
