{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll try to get a bit more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $19,000? It's a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $19000. How about $17500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $19,000, Bob's offer of $17,500 is still above my minimum value of $15,000. It's a good deal for me, and accepting it would ensure a sale without risking further negotiation."
