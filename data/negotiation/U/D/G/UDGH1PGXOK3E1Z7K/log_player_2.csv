"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting her offer saves you a substantial amount of money.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
