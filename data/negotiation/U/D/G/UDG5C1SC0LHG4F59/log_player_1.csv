Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll gain. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a price that maximizes my profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I'm confident in the product's value and believe Bob is motivated to buy it. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price by $50,000 from Bob's offer. This shows him I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired amount.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while also highlighting the value he'll receive with this offer.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to me and potentially enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $1,350,000 is still out of my range. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this might be closer to what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come back with the same offer he made in round 2.  This indicates he's unwilling to go any higher. While $1,300,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I want.  Rather than risk a lengthy negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me the maximum profit and avoids the potential for further concessions."
