Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. It's higher than what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob, with a value of $800,000, will find this offer tempting enough to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 just yet. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. I believe this will be a compelling offer for Bob, making him reconsider and potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum, so that's the best option in this situation."
