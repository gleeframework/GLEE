"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. You have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Offer:** $85 is a fair price, considering Alice values the product at $80. It leaves room for negotiation but also shows that you're serious about buying.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still 9 rounds left, so even if Alice rejects, you have time to adjust your offer.
* **Motivating Alice:** The counteroffer is a clear signal to Alice that you're willing to negotiate and that a deal is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $90. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** $90 is still higher than your ideal price, and you have 7 rounds remaining. There's still time to get a better price.
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting, you're showing Alice that you're determined to negotiate and that $90 is still not your ideal price. This might push her further towards your desired price point.
* **Fallback option:** You have the option to buy from John for $100 if necessary, so you can afford to be a bit more patient and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm interested, $90 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $87.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This offer shows you're willing to compromise, but still pushing for a better price.  $87.50 is a good midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's latest.
* **Clear Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and the potential for a quick agreement.
* **Strategic Counter:** This offer is likely to lead to a quick resolution, as it leaves less room for further back and forth."
