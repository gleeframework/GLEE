Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering my budget constraints, I am unable to pay such a high amount. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to something more reasonable, perhaps closer to $500,000? I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping for a more affordable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's guaranteed offer.  There's room for negotiation.
