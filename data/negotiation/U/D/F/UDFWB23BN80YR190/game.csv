"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
