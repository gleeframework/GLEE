Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I would be willing to purchase it for $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest,  $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $900,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially getting a lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 which is the minimum acceptable price."
