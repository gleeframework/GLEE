"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I would be willing to purchase it for $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest,  $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $900,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
