{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is too expensive at $1,800,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation that I'm willing to negotiate and that I believe the product is worth less than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

$1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm willing to walk away and buy from John at this price."
