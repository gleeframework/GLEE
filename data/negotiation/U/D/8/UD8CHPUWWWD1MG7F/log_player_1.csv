Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you for $19,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, starting high allows you to maximize potential profit.  
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the process. You can always come down in price later if needed.
* **Value emphasis:**  The message highlights the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your negotiation. Be prepared to potentially lower your price if Bob shows resistance, but always aim to get as close to your initial offer as possible."
