"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value, and it leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the value of this deal. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
