"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. I know it's a great deal for you as it's worth that much to you. If you're interested, let me know.  If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to bluff you into paying more by claiming she'll sell it to John for $8,000. You know you have the option to buy it from John at that price, so there's no reason to overpay."
