"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, given its worth to you, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and she's offering it for $1,200,000.  This means you can still save a significant amount of money by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value for it and my own budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
