**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's moving very slowly and in small increments. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price close to $1,200,000, especially with only a few rounds left. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Therefore, it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John."
