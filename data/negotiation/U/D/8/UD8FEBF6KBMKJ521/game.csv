"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product offers. How about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,020,000? This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your current one. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to this negotiation, and I respect that.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's true value.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",970000.0,Bob,8,
