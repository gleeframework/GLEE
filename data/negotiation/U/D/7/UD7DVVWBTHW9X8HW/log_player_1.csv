"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I am unable to meet at $12,000. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I would like to continue negotiating if possible.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely he'll come close to my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a fair deal."
