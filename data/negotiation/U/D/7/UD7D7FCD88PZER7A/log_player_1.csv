"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I have a good starting point.
* **Expressing confidence:**  I'm positioning the product as a valuable asset to entice Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000), so there's still room for us to negotiate. 
* **Aiming for higher:**  I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,800,000, and rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to counter with a better price for myself.
* **Value of time:**  I still have 8 rounds remaining, so it's worth it to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,800,000 is a little lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're able to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a decrease:**  I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price from the initial offer, but not by too much. This shows I'm serious about selling but still value the product.
* **Finality:**  Stating that it's my ""final offer"" adds pressure to Bob and makes him consider accepting.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,900,000 is still above my minimum and keeps the deal potentially profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1750000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $1,750,000 is still above my minimum price of $1,500,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Time for strategy:**  Since Bob is clearly trying to get a lower price, it's worth continuing to negotiate. I'm still in the early rounds and can afford to be a bit more flexible.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer again if I hold firm and don't accept this offer.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,800,000 to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,750,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?

**Conclusion:**  It's a tough choice, but the risk of losing the deal and getting only $1,500,000 from John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price in future rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and a decent profit."
