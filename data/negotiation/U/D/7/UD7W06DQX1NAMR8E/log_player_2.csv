Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is consistently moving towards a middle ground. At $8,250, the price is getting close enough to her value ($8,000) that she might not budge much more. Accepting now secures a reasonable discount without risking the deal by pushing too hard."
