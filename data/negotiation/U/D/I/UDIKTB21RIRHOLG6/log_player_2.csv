The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $170.  It makes more sense to reject and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is $120.  This is the price I could get it for from John, so I'm not willing to go higher."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth $120 to me and I can get it from John for that price.  I'm going to go with the guaranteed deal."
