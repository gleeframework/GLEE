Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so you need to position your offer as appealing yet profitable. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high at $950,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
