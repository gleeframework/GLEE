"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a strong opening position that sets a high benchmark and gives me room to negotiate.  While Bob may be hesitant to accept, this sets the stage for a potentially lucrative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $800,000.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $800,000. It's time to close the deal!  There's no reason to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
