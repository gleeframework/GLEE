"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $850,000? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more accessible to you. I hope this revised offer better aligns with your expectations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $825,000? This is higher than your initial offer but lower than my previous proposal. It allows us to cover costs and maintain a reasonable profit, while also making the product more affordable for you. I hope this revised offer will be more acceptable.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
