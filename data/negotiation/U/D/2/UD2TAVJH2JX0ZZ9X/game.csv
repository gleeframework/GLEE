"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, but $9000 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $9250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
