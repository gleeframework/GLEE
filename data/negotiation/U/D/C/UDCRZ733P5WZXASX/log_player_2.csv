Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $115, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? I think that's a fair price for this product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5

``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, $122.50 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity altogether."
