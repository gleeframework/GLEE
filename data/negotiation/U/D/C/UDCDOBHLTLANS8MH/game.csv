"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's worth to you.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
