{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love!  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still below what I believe the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** I'm leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can likely get a higher price from Bob, given he expressed interest in the product.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, I want to see if I can do better by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by saying ""Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."" This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $140 or even $145. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option, I don't want to miss out on the potential for a higher profit from Bob if I can get him to agree to a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down a bit from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We've already negotiated quite a bit, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John for $150 provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While I would like to earn more, it's not worth the risk of potentially getting a lower offer or continuing a lengthy negotiation that might not result in a deal. Selling to John ensures a secure and profitable outcome."
