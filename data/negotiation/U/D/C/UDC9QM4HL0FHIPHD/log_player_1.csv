Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell yourself short.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you're emphasizing the ""exclusive offer"" and implying the product's value might be higher than Bob initially thought. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message hints at your willingness to negotiate, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's profitable for you but acceptable to him.

**Important:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price or his counter-offers remain too low, you can always return to your guaranteed sale with John."
