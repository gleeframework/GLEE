Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
