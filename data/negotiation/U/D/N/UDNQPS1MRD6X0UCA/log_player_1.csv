"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see how much Bob is willing to pay and hopefully get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm confident I can get a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my first offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is still within my acceptable range and allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. This offer is still a good deal for me, but it's becoming more tempting for Bob to accept."
