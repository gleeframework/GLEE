"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet at $13500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? I'll include a free installation and a 1-year warranty. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a price closer to your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to let you know that I've had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $12000. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold off on selling it to him. What do you say we finalize the deal at $13000, and I'll throw in the extras I mentioned earlier?",13000.0,Alice,7,
