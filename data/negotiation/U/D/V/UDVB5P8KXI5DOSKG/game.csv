"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $700,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
