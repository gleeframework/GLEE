"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a price you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
