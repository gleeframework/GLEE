"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the product to someone who truly appreciates it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $15000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",16500.0,Alice,5,
