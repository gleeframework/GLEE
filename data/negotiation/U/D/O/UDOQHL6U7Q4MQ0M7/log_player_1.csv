"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping for.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. John's offer of $800,000 is within reach, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal.  It's still higher than John's offer, but I'm willing to consider selling to John if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is equal to John's offer.  There's no reason to continue negotiating at this point, as I'm not likely to get a better deal with Bob. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
