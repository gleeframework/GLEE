Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 (its value to me), aiming slightly lower increases the chance Bob accepts. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still potentially attractive if he sees enough value in the product.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $150, ensuring I don't lose out."
