"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is at the high end of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Would you be willing to come down to $1300000? This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
