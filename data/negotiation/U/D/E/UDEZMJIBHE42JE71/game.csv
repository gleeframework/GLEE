"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit.",10000.0,Alice,5,
