"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, considering your valuation, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",13250.0,Alice,3,
