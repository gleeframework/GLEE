"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price. He has a fallback option with John for $1,000,000, so rejecting and counter-offering is a logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price is still very good for you, and I believe we can make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob. While he can get the product from John for $1,000,000, there is a risk that John might raise his price or become unavailable in the future. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price, minimizing potential future complications."
