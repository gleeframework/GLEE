""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?  I think that's a fair price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,500?  This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $10,250? This would be a good middle ground, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $10,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further hassle."
