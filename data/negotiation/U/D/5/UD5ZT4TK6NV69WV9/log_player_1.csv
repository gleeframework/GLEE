Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to profit from the sale.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product.  I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a good opportunity to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough for me. I'm not willing to continue negotiating and risk losing the sale completely.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
