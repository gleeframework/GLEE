"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is less than John's price, you can likely do better.  Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $1,350,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also well below my maximum price of $1,500,000.  I believe Alice will be motivated to accept this offer as it's still significantly higher than her valuation of $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  It's also very close to her initial offer of $1,350,000, suggesting she's not willing to budge much.  However, I'm still confident I can get a better price. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is a little too high for me.  I'm going to meet her halfway by offering $1,300,000.  This is still a good deal for me as it's well below my maximum price of $1,500,000, and also higher than her valuation of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I can convince Alice to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my maximum price of $1,500,000. While there's still a potential to negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is firm on her asking price. 

At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiations. There's a chance Alice won't budge any further, and I'll end up paying more than I'd like.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
