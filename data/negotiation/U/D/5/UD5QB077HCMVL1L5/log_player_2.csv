Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $750,000 is still a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to come down to $875,000 if it means we can close this deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $875,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
