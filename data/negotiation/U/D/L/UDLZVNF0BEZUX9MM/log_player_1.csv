{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its potential and the fact that I'm confident it can generate significant returns. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,500,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also ensures you get a good profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer is a good balance between getting a high price and starting the negotiation process. It's important to understand Bob's perspective and adjust future offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than the minimum you're willing to accept ($1,000,000).  It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob since he is clearly interested in the product. There's room for negotiation and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,400,000 to reflect the true value I'm confident it holds for you. This price allows for both of us to have a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $1,400,000 is a reasonable compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and emphasizes the product's value, framing the counteroffer as a fair solution for both parties. It also encourages further dialogue to find a middle ground.

**Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, you show flexibility and make it more likely he will accept your offer. However, you are still holding firm on your minimum price, which is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above your minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  While it's not your initial target, it's a good deal given the negotiation process. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids risking a further drop in price or a potential loss if you sell to John."
