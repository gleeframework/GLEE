"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price gives Bob room to counteroffer, but it's high enough that I'm still making a profit above my minimum. 
* **Strategic Approach:** By starting high, I can potentially get a price closer to my goal, while also giving myself room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aiming Higher:** While $8,500 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a low price and encourage him to come up with a more appealing offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm not immediately selling to John because I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit above my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** This counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum while potentially appealing to Bob, who may be willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects, but also avoids risking the deal by becoming too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistence:** Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. 
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting, I can continue to push for a higher price while maintaining a strong negotiating position. 
* **Avoiding Premature Settlement:** Selling to John at this point would be a suboptimal outcome, as I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Deal:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting close to my minimum. I'm making a small concession here,  but still aiming for a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is likely to be very close to what Bob is willing to pay. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While selling to John is an option, I'm trying to maximize my profit by securing a slightly higher price with Bob."
