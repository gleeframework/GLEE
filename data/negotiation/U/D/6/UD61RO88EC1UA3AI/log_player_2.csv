Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for the product.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're unlikely to get a significantly better price from Alice. She's already come down from $13,000 to $11,500. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better price, and we risk Alice becoming firmer in her position. 
* **Savings:**  $11,500 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000."
