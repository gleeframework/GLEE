"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I need to make a small profit. I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
