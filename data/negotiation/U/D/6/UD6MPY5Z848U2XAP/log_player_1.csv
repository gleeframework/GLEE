Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit** by starting at a high price.
* **Keep the negotiation open** by not immediately going for the highest possible price.
* **Maintain a positive relationship with Bob** for potential future deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. Bob is showing interest and acknowledging the value of the product, which means there's room for negotiation.  

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This will keep the negotiation moving and might lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm reducing my price slightly to $11,000, showing flexibility. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his proposed price.
* **Positive message:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the great deal Bob is getting at this price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm not immediately jumping to my minimum price, leaving room for further bargaining.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $11,000 is still a significant profit for me, closer to my initial goal.
* **Encourage Bob to accept:**  The lower price might make the deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  The friendly message keeps the conversation constructive and respectful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good compromise.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it could also drag out the process, especially if Bob is unwilling to budge further.  
* **Avoiding John's offer:** $10,500 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $10,500 is the best decision in this situation. It's a good price for me, and it avoids potentially lengthy negotiations or a lower offer from John."
