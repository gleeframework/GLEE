Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. There's no reason to negotiate further or buy from John since the price is the same."
