"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,400,000 is still too high.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or by buying from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000 for this product. It's a good starting point, but I need to make sure it aligns with my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on the price.  I've tried to price the product fairly, reflecting its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal.  He should continue negotiating.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower her price further, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and represents a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be mindful of the value this product represents.  Would you consider $1,275,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to Bob's desired price range.  It's a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than the $1,500,000 John is offering, and  Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and  Bob might end up paying more to John."
