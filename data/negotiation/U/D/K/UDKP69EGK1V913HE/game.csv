"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you at $13,500, which is still a good deal considering the value the product will bring to your business. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",13500.0,Alice,5,
