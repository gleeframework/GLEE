"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This offer starts at a high price point, aiming to maximize my potential profit. It is well below Bob's value for the product, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I can potentially get more. I'll reject and counter-offer to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is within a reasonable range and significantly higher than what John is offering.  Accepting now ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price."
