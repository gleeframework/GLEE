"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  He's trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,050,000 is closer to his target, there's still room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference again. How about we settle on $1,025,000?  I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the complexity of the product. How about we settle on $1,075,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his target, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  He's already rejected offers closer to this amount, so he has no reason to accept this one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm still not quite there on the price though.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. How about we include a complimentary service worth $20,000, and we'll call it a day at $1,070,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  While it's above his target, he's already negotiated a price close to this amount.  The additional value (the service worth $20,000) is a significant bonus, making this a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal, especially since he has only 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to close the deal and save some money compared to buying from John."
