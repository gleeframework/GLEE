Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Offering an ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, by starting with a strong but reasonable price, you increase the likelihood of securing a deal that benefits both parties."
