"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both parties to find a price that works better for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and $12,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  At $12,000, Bob is still saving $1,000 compared to John's offer, making it a worthwhile deal."
