(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, you want to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a 50% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While it's closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. You should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  There's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'm offering a price that's closer to her last offer but still below my maximum budget. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while keeping the pressure on her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer to your limit.  You should continue negotiating, as there's a good chance you can get her down even further.  You're within striking distance of a good deal and should continue to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you're now just $100,000 apart. This offer is your maximum limit, but it's a strong bargaining position. If Alice accepts, you get the product for your maximum price. If she rejects, you can move on to John's offer without feeling like you left any money on the table."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $50,000 away from your maximum price. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that she might not come down any further, and you'd be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, it's safer to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a better price."
