Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm happy to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth attempting. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob (potential gain of $400,000). This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer doesn't have to be the final one. There's a possibility for further negotiation if Bob counters, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price within the $1,400,000 - $1,500,000 range."
