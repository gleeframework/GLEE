"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's a significant gap between her value ($1,500,000) and your maximum ($1,000,000).  A counteroffer will allow you to explore that gap and hopefully reach a more favorable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's aim for a deal that works for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,150,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. A counteroffer might bring her closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1100000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1150000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1125000.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal and would allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,125,000,  it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, the negotiations are getting close to my limit, and I don't want to risk going over.  It's more advantageous for me to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000 and save $125,000."
