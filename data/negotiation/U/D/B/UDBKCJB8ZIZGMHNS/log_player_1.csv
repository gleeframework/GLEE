This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum. This allows for room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find common ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can push for a higher price, but if he won't budge, I'll consider selling to John."
