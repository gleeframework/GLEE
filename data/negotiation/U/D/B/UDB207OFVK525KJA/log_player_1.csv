{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is higher than Bob's value but not too far off.  This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable, it leaves no room for profit. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your position, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to exceed $12,000 for the product. Would it be possible to meet at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm not getting the ideal profit, Bob is sticking to his bottom line.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potential counteroffers that might drag on. Selling to John guarantees me the minimum acceptable value for my product."
