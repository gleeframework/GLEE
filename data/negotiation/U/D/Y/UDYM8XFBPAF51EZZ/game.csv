"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but no more. Can you meet me there?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really trying to keep costs down. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10900.0,Bob,6,
