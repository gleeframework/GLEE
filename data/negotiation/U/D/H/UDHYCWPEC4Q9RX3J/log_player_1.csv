Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly justifies the higher price without revealing her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While mentioning John isn't necessary yet, implying that there's other interest can create a sense of urgency for Bob to decide."
