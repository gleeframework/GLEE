Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $900,000, as it's significantly lower than my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I can get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm not confident we can reach a compromise that would satisfy both of us.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
