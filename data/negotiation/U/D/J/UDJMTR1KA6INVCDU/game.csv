,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While your offer is appreciated, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial assessment.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This offer is as high as I can realistically go while still staying within my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still looking for a price that's within my budget. I can offer $1,250,000, which reflects the value of the product for me and is the highest I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
