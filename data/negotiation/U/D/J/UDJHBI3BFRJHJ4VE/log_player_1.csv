"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. By offering a price that's still below Bob's estimated worth ($1,500,000), I'm incentivizing him to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer you $850,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I still have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer and shows my willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $875,000?  It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for less than $900,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $875,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
