"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, I think $950,000 is a little high. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a little rich for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
