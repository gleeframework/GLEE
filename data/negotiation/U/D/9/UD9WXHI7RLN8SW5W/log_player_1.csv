Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
