"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm willing to start with a fair price. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it, which is closer to what I can afford. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,4,
