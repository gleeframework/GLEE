"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm willing to start with a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can start by offering a lower price and see if Alice is willing to compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

While $85 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your $100 limit.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
