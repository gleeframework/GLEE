{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $100 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go as low as $90.  How about we split the difference at $105? That's still a great price for this product, and it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time and if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our negotiation, but I can't go lower than $100. This is a fair price for the quality of the product.  If you're serious about purchasing, I'm happy to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
