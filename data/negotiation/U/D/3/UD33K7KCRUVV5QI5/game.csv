"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to a price point I could consider, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Let's settle this at $9,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise given its value.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a price I'm comfortable with, and it still gives you a good return on the product.",8500.0,Bob,6,
