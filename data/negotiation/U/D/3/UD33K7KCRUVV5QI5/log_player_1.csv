Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to a price point I could consider, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Let's settle this at $9,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise given its value."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a price I'm comfortable with, and it still gives you a good return on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and at $8,500 I'm still making a decent profit over John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
