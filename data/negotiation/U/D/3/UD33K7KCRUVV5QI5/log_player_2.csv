"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but clearly states your budget limitations.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:** While $6,000 is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, it's still a reasonable profit margin for her if the product's value to her is truly $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still too high for your budget. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to a price point I could consider, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious about finding a deal, but not moving too close to our $8,000 limit.
* **Justification:**  We're providing a reason for our counteroffer (""reflects the product's value to me"") to remind Alice that value is subjective. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By phrasing it as ""a fair offer,"" we're still aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Let's settle this at $9,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is definitely getting closer to your acceptable price range, but you're not quite there yet. There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a price I'm comfortable with, and it still gives you a good return on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** We're now getting close to our walk-away point ($8,000 from John). Offering $8,500 positions us as serious buyers while still leaving a small margin for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  We're reminding Alice of the benefits of closing the deal with us (""comfortable price"" and ""good return"").
* **Conciliatory Tone:** The tone remains respectful and collaborative, showing Alice we're committed to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
