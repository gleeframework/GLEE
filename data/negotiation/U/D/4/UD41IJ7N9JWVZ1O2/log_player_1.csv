Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for negotiation upwards from there. I'll take the safe option.
