{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to accept a price lower than my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, providing me with a safety net.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation that hopefully ends with a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that much so quickly. 

* **Counteroffer is Needed:** I need to counteroffer to try and reach a more acceptable price. 
* **John as Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, which gives me confidence to stand firm and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focusing on finding common ground.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000,  giving me some wiggle room if Bob counters again.
* **John as Backup:** I haven't forgotten John's offer of $15,000, which gives me confidence to stand firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $10,200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target.  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet.

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me confidence to keep negotiating. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $10,200 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,200. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,600 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing anything by making this counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects this offer again."
