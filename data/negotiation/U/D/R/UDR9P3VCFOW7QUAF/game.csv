,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $10,200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $10,200 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10600.0,Alice,5,
