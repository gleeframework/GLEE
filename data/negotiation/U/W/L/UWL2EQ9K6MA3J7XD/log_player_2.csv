# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
