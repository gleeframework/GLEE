"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify a price above $800,000. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
