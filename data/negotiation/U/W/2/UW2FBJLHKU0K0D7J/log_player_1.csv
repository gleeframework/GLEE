Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but unfortunately, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
