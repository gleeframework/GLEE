"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and market potential warrant a much higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but unfortunately, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept for this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
