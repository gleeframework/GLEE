"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product is worth a lot more based on its features and benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $9,000? That's my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal today, but $9,000 is just outside my reach. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'll accept immediately.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  How about this: to make this deal happen right now, I'll come down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.",8500.0,Alice,7,
