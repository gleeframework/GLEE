"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250, which would be $7,875. Can you consider my revised offer?",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,875 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we compromise at $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to avoid selling to another buyer for the same amount. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
