Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  It's a great deal for something you'll benefit from immensely."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value and Bob's potential benefit, Alice is subtly anchoring the price in his mind. 
* **Urgency:**  Suggesting she'll list it publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so she's free to aim higher with Bob. 
 
This strategy maximizes Alice's potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that's reasonable for him."
