Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $100 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. Can we meet somewhere in between, like $110?
