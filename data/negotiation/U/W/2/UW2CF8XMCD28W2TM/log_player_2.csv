"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to save more.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good discount. $700,000 is a substantial price reduction from Alice's initial offer, and I'm hoping it will encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial price and allows me to save a substantial amount. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or the time constraints of the 10 rounds make this offer appealing. Accepting ensures I get the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
