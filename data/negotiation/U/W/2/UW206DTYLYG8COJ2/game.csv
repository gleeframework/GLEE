"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
