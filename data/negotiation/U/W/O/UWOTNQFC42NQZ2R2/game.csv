"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $850,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and go with $775,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, but $725,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price.",750000.0,Alice,5,
