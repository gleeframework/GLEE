{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. He's offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, hoping to entice her to negotiate further."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if he can get closer to his target of $10,000. There's still time to negotiate with Alice, and he can always fall back on buying from John if it's necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit.  He's offering a price that's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's a compromise that acknowledges Alice's need to make a profit. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is likely to switch to John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  Bob has been trying to negotiate for a while and the price is still above his maximum.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 to avoid any further risk of Alice rejecting his offer or continuing to ask for a higher price."
