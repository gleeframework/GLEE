Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price.  Let's talk - what do you think about [your price]?  "", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $120, which is higher than my minimum of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to maximize potential profit, but also allows for a potential deal. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value to Bob while leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Next Steps:** I will be watching to see if Bob accepts or rejects the offer, and ready to adjust my strategy accordingly."
