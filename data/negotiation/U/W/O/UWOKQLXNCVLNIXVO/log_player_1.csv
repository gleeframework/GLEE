"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value, and it allows me to get a fair price for my hard work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet.  He's offering significantly less than what I know the product is worth to him, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to be flexible, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $975,000? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet at $990,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down further. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $987,500? That's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, we're now in round 6.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or a stalemate. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good deal, and it's time to secure that sale."
