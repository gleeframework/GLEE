"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This would allow us both to close a deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
