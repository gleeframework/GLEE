"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject her offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John.  There's still room for negotiation to get the price closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This would allow us both to close a deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still too high.  While she is clearly willing to negotiate,  it's likely she won't go lower than $1,100,000, which is still more than you're willing to pay. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John at $1,000,000, as this saves you $150,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
