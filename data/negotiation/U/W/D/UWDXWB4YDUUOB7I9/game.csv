"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $90. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $95 and $92.50. How about we settle on $93.75?",93.75,Alice,5,
