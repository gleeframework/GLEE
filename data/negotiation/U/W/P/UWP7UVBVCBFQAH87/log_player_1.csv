Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I need to offer at least that to ensure I don't lose money.
* **Potential Upsell:**  By offering $15,000, I'm aiming for a higher profit. This is a reasonable markup, as I don't know the product's value to Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk with this offer. 

**Strategy:**  This offer is a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale. If Bob doesn't value the product as highly, I can still fall back on the sale to John."
