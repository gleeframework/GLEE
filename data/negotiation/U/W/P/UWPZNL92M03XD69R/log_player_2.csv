"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make a deal!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about $1,000,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.
