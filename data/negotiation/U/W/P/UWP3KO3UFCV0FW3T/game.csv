"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $175 for it.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me in the middle at $157.50?",157.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. $157.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's try $165.  This gives us both some room to compromise.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $157.50 and $165, which would be $161.25. Can you consider that?",161.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. I'm going to come down a little to $162.50. Let's see if we can make this happen!",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $162.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $161.25. Can you consider that?",161.25,Bob,6,
