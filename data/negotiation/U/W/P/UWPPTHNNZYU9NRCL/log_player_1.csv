Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price, even though the exact value to Bob is the same as your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving you the chance to still secure a price higher than John's offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have a way to communicate the offer to John should Bob reject it."
