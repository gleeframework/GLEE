"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12000. Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're serious about buying this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
