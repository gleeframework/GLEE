I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is above my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price."

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair price and we can close the deal."
