Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Benefit for Bob:**  Bob still gets a good deal at $120 as the product is worth $150 to him. This makes him more likely to accept.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price down slightly, but I'll still be able to make a good profit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $80 provides security and allows me to be more confident in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $90 is still profitable for me, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Bob's Interest:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product and willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $80 would be a guaranteed profit, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings with Bob. 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer of $90, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $120. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $105 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Fair Deal for Both:**  This price allows both of us to feel like we're getting a good deal. Bob gets the product for less than his initial assessment, and I still make a decent profit.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and show that I'm willing to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so how about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $97.50 is above my minimum price of $80, and still a good profit margin. 
* **Reaching Agreement:** Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially ending in a sale to John for $80 is too high.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit."
