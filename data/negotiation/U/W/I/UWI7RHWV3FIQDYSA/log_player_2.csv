"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, so he's not in a desperate situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $1,300,000, the product is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money while still securing the product."
