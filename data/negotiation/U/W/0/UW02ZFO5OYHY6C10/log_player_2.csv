You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above the product's value to her ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping to strike a deal closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a slight increase from her original offer but still higher than her stated value for the product.  While it's closer to my target price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. I'm showing flexibility and willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price below $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Alice's minimum acceptable price and my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still above my ideal. We're getting closer to the middle ground, and there's no need to jump to John just yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $987,500, which is still above my target price.  I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my last offer.  I believe this offer is fair, given Alice's stated minimum price and my own maximum budget.  I'm hoping to reach an agreement in this round and avoid having to make a final decision about John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but we're now in round 7. This means that we only have 3 rounds left. If I keep rejecting Alice's offers, there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement in time.

While I'm close to my target price, it's still risky to keep negotiating. If Alice keeps increasing her offer, I might end up paying more than I initially planned.

Therefore, it's wiser to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This guarantees I get the product, even if it's slightly above my ideal price.  I'm willing to accept this outcome to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the product altogether."
