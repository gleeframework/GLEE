"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable for you, potentially saving your company thousands of dollars and increasing efficiency. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high, and there's definitely room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price.  We're in round 1, so it's safe to reject and see what Alice counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I understand its potential value. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. To start, I'd like to offer you $850,000.  This is a fair price that still allows you a good profit, while ensuring I get a deal that works for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating that Bob is serious about negotiating. It's a good starting point for a back-and-forth, while still offering Alice a comfortable profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still high, but it's a step in the right direction. It shows she's willing to negotiate. I'm not ready to settle yet, as there's still room for further negotiation.  I'll counter again to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, and I agree it has potential. However, $900,000 is still outside of my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise further while still staying within a reasonable price range. It's a smaller increase than Alice's last offer, signaling that Bob is trying to find a price closer to his ideal range.  This should keep the negotiation moving without pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a deal that benefits us both, I must be firm on the value I bring to the table. Therefore, my final offer is $885,000. This leaves a relatively small gap and ensures we both walk away feeling positive about this transaction. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice's final offer is still within his budget and is significantly lower than John's price.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or John changing his price is high.  It's best to secure the product at this price before any potential issues arise."
