"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
