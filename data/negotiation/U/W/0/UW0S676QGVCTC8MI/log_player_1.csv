Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000? This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a profit. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $1,550,000 is less than my initial goal, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
