"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's target price and closer to her own valuation. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to push for a lower price."
