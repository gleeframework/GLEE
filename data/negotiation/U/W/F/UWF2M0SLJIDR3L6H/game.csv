"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This would allow us both to make a solid profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a compromise, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to offer $987,500. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a positive outcome. Let's finalize this deal at this price.",987500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one last effort to reach an agreement. I'll meet you halfway between $987,500 and $1,000,000, which is $993,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",993750.0,Alice,9,
