"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value to you is significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price, he can likely negotiate further. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down to a price closer to his initial counteroffer. He's still much better off buying from Alice, even at the current price, than buying from John."
