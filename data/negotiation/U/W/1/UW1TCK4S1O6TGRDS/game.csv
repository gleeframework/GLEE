"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value to you is significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
