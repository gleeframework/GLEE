,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $102. It's a good balance between your budget and the product's value.",102.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $100. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.
