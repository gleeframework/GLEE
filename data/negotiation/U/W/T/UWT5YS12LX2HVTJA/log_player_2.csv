While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I assure you it's worth no less than $800000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This price reflects the potential upside I see for you. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
