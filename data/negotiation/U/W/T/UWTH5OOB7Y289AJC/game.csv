"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you is $15,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I can tell we're close to a deal. How about we settle this right now at $11,200?  That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer to a deal.  While $11,200 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $11,300? This is a small difference, but it would help me reach my desired price point. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,7,
