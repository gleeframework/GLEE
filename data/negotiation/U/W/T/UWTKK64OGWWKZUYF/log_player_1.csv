"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm not willing to settle for anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to settle for $1,000,000, especially since I know I can get that from John. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate. This price is a good compromise and allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  I'm choosing to accept his offer, as it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  There's a good chance I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
