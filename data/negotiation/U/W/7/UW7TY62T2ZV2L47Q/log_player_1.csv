I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
