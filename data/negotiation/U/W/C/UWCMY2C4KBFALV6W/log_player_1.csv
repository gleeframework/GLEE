Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This makes negotiation difficult.

**The Strategy**

Since a mutually beneficial deal within both parties' valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **Aim High and Hope:** You could start with a high offer (above $1,500,000) hoping Bob might overvalue the product or be willing to negotiate down to a price closer to your minimum.  This is risky as it's likely Bob will reject the offer outright.

2. **Accept John's Offer:** Knowing Bob likely won't meet your minimum, it's most logical to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.

**The Offer (Leaning Towards the Realistic Option)**

While you could try a high offer, it's likely to be a waste of time. Here's a message reflecting the understanding that a deal with Bob is unlikely:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. After reviewing my options, I need to be upfront â€“ my minimum acceptable price is significantly higher than what you've indicated you're willing to pay. Unless you have a revised offer closer to my asking price, I think it's best to be transparent and let you know I'm leaning towards accepting another offer I've received."", 
""product_price"": 1700000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Transparency:** This message is direct but polite. It acknowledges Bob's interest but clearly states your minimum is much higher.
* **High Anchor:** Offering a price of $1,700,000 sets a high anchor. Even though it's unlikely Bob will accept, it leaves room for him to counter-offer, potentially moving closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning another offer subtly pressures Bob by suggesting he might lose the opportunity.

**Important Note:** While unlikely, Bob could surprise you with a counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate if he comes back with a price closer to your range."
