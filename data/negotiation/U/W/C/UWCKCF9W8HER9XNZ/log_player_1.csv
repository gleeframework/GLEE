Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm starting with a friendly approach and highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to accept. 

This strategy aims to get the best price possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also avoids being too aggressive, which could lead to a quick rejection from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, say around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a better price than selling to John, it's still below my desired target. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to land somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a fair offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum price of $80 and gives Bob some wiggle room.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging his offer, but reiterating the value of the product to him. I'm also emphasizing that this counteroffer is a good deal for both of us.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum price and is also closer to my desired target.  While I could try to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk is that Bob could walk away and I'd be forced to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting his offer is the most reasonable choice at this point."
