"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, say around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a fair offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
