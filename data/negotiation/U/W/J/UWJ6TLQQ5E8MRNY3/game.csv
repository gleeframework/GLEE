"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances my minimum requirement with your willingness to purchase the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I believe this is a fair offer, given that it's a significant price reduction from your initial offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
