Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  What do you say?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot to you, and I believe a price closer to $1,300,000 is fair.  Let's keep working together to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we try $1,250,000?  I'm confident you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly not budging much below $1,250,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000."
