"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot to you, and I believe a price closer to $1,300,000 is fair.  Let's keep working together to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we try $1,250,000?  I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
