"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal! ",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is around $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $887,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not convinced $887,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $862,500, which is closer to my initial offer. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $862,500 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $875,000,  which represents a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the product's value, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $855,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $865,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",865000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced $865,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $845,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,000,000.",845000.0,Bob,10,
