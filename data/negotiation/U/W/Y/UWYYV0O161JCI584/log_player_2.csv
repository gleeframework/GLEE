"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting the initial offer, you create an opportunity for a better deal."
