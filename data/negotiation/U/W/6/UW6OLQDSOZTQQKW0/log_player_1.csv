"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but not so high that it would immediately make him reject the offer. I'm hoping to leverage my knowledge of his value and create room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I believe I can do better. Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I still want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but a significant reduction from my initial proposal.  I want to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I still have a few rounds to go and  I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this compromise will entice him to close the deal. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to start getting closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I only have a few rounds left. I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
