Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product I think you'll find valuable for $175. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations slightly above your minimum price to give yourself room to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $150, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if you present it well.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob."
