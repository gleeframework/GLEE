"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me is no less than $1000000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to make this a win-win for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential savings for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  While $1150000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $1100000. This would save you a significant amount compared to selling to John, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1120000. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where selling to John becomes more attractive. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1120000, which would be $1110000. What do you think?",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I hear you, and I understand your position.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up slightly to $1105000. This would save you a substantial amount compared to selling to John, and it puts us closer to a deal. How does that sound?",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1120000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1105000 and $1120000, which would be $1112500. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
