{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  While $1,150,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still looking to get a better deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1120000. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where selling to John becomes more attractive. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1120000, which would be $1110000. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you, and I understand your position.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,105,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1120000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  You have only three rounds left, and Alice is showing some firmness with her offer.
* **Progress Made:** You've already managed to lower the price significantly from Alice's initial $1,200,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While a slightly lower price might be possible, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance you might not be able to reach a deal with Alice, and you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $1,125,000 is still a good price for the product, and it saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. 

It's a good idea to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
