Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  This is a limited-time opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price gives you significant negotiating power.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a very high price ($1,900,000) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he counter-offers, the negotiation will likely revolve around a much higher number than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique"" and ""special"" nature to justify the high price, even though the exact value proposition isn't explicitly stated.

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive.  There's a chance Bob will be completely turned off by the initial high price and refuse to negotiate. However, given the guaranteed sale to John, the potential reward for a much higher sale price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
