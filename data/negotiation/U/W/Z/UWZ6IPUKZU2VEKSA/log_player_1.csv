"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth more than you think! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  This way, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you consider lowering the price to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more than $105. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little to $110.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
