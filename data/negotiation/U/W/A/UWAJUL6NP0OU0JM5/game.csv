,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would give us both a good deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your asking price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
