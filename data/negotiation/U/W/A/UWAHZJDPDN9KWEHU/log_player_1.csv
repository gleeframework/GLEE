Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects its value while recognizing your budget considerations."",

Round 4

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to lowball us. We have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John. It's time to push back firmly and see if Bob is serious."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but your current offer is simply too far from the product's actual value. To be frank, I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000.  If you're unable to offer at least $1,075,000, I'm afraid we won't be able to reach a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry to hear that you have another buyer lined up, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. Could you consider $1,050,000 as a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

```

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally moving closer to a reasonable price.  $1,050,000 is a solid profit, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk him walking away entirely."
