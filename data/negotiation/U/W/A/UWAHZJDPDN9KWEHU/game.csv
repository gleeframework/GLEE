"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects its value while recognizing your budget considerations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but your current offer is simply too far from the product's actual value. To be frank, I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000.  If you're unable to offer at least $1,075,000, I'm afraid we won't be able to reach a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry to hear that you have another buyer lined up, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. Could you consider $1,050,000 as a fair compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
