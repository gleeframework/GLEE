"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to explore this option further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I believe a price of $1,550,000 reflects the product's true value. This is still a great deal for you, considering its potential. Let's continue discussing this to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down slightly. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,475,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts?",1475000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. While your offer of $1,475,000 is closer to my expectations, it's still slightly below my minimum. To bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,500,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
