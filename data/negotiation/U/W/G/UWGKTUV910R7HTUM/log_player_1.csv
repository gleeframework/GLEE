Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
