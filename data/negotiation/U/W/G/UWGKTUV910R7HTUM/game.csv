"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is your top offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $860,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",860000.0,Alice,5,
