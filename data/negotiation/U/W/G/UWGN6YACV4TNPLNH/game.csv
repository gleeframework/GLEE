"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's meet in the middle!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about $13,500? That's a reasonable compromise, wouldn't you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $15,500. It's closer to my price and a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $14,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we both need to compromise.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $14,250. It's a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this.",14250.0,Bob,8,
