"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little bit.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,500?  That would be a fair deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  To be fair to both of us, would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're really invested in this product, and I respect that. How about we settle at $10,500?  It's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
