"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than our actual budget, we create room for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to move on price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer positions us as serious buyers but also communicates that we're not desperate and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counter-offer will give us valuable information about Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident justifies this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** While Alice moved from her initial price, the current offer is still significantly higher than our budget and John's alternative price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate, even if slightly, indicates there might be room to go lower.  
* **No Rush:** We are not under pressure to accept this offer, so continued negotiation is in our best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We are increasing our offer, but at a slower pace than Alice's price reductions, signaling our price sensitivity. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  We are communicating our budget limitations while expressing continued interest in finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $700,000, we are still leaving some room for negotiation before hitting our $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.  However, I also need to be mindful of the product's value. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled this as her ""final offer"" and is unwilling to go lower.
* **Still Too High:** Even with the reduction, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than our $800,000 limit and John's offer.
* **No Justification:**  We haven't received compelling information about the product's value that justifies exceeding our budget or John's offer. 

**It's time to exercise our backup option and secure the product from John at a price we know is acceptable.**"
