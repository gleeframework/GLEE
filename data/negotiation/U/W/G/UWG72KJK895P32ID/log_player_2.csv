# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9800. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
