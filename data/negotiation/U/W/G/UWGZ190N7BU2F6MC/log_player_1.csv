{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will spark a conversation and potentially lead to a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $120. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value, and I'm hesitant to go any lower.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll take the safe route and sell to him."
