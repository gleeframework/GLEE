``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a little below what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for potential negotiation. However, it is also significantly above my minimum price, giving me a comfortable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is lower than I had hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
This counteroffer compromises by meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's more palatable to him while still securing a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's closer. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to accept $8,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
``` 
 
This counteroffer offers a price that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but it's still within the range I'm comfortable with. It also shows a willingness to compromise, which could help sway Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,750 one more time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge from his offer, and I'm reaching the point where I need to make a decision. While selling to Bob for $8,750 would be better than selling to John for $8,000, I'm not convinced we'll reach a deal with Bob at a price that meets my minimum.  I'm going to accept John's offer to ensure I get a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
