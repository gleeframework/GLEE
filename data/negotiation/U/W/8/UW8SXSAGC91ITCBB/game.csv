"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100?  That's my maximum price point.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 100. How about we meet in the middle at 125? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  I'm really hoping we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 110 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 115? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
