"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $12,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
