Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a significant value proposition considering its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of a ""deal"" for Bob.  While it's significantly more than his perceived value ($800,000), you're leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  The message subtly implies you have other options, reminding Bob that this is a time-sensitive opportunity.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
* Pay attention to Bob's response for clues about his true interest and potential to meet closer to your desired price."
