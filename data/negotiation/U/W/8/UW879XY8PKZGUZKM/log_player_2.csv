{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price of $1,000,000. However, it's closer than her previous offer. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a target price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise, as it's right in the middle of our last two offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,062,500, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is still higher than my target price of $1,000,000.  While we've made progress, we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk her driving the price back up. It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at my target price."
