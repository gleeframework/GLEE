"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a target price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise, as it's right in the middle of our last two offers. What do you say?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,062,500, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counter with $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
