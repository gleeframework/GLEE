"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll significantly increase his offer. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further risk of prolonged negotiation."
