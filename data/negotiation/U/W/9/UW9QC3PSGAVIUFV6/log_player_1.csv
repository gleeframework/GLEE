Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm not sure if it's worth $150 to me, but I think it's a good product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $150 and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $130 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my target with each round. It's a good deal for both of us.  I'm happy to close this deal."
