Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for any less than $100.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($120) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $115 is a strong starting point, there's a slight buffer in case Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer ensures you receive more than John's offer ($100).
* **Transparency and Justification:** By mentioning Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you create a sense of transparency and fairness, potentially increasing his willingness to accept."
