Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above your budget.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to pay $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as you have a few rounds left.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a certain amount for the product. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is closer to my target price. This is my last offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your budget, and you only have 3 rounds left. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that you won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John at $8,000 is the most secure and financially advantageous option at this point."
