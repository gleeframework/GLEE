Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This is a significant advantage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, a price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he got a better deal. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  Offering it at $12,000 gives you a significant profit over your minimum ($8,000) while still being enticing enough for Bob to likely accept.  

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal appealing enough for Bob to avoid the risk of going to your backup buyer."
