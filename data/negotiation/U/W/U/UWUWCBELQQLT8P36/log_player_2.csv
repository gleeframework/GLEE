{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John wants $15,000.
* **You save money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, the goal is to get the best deal for yourself. Accepting Alice's offer is the most advantageous decision."
