,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final concession. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $9,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,125. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for.",9125.0,Bob,6,
