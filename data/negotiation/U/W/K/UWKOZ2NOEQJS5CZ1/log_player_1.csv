"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for the price, highlighting its value to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a high initial price:**  By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings.
* **Initiate negotiations:** I want to get Bob engaged and start the negotiation process.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still adjust my price downwards while retaining a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. 
* **I have room to negotiate further.**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob without risking losing the deal entirely. 
* **Selling to John is a good option, but not yet necessary.**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've countered with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still using a friendly and encouraging tone, reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

This approach aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about negotiating a deal.
* **Maintain pressure:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not going back to my original price, which might signal a lack of interest.
* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:** By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm increasing the chances that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still under my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More negotiation room:**  I believe we can still reach a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is tempting:** I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be the more rational choice, but I still want to see if I can close a deal with Bob.

By rejecting this offer, I keep the negotiation open and avoid losing out on a potentially higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to work with you. Let's split the difference - $10,150. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a competitive price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Once again, I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows continued willingness to compromise.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer brings me closer to my minimum acceptable price while still appealing to Bob's budget.
* **Emphasizing the Deal:** I reiterate the value of the product and the benefits of closing the deal for both of us.

By offering a price that's close to Bob's while maintaining a decent profit margin, I'm aiming to:

* **Increase the likelihood of acceptance:** This offer is likely to be more appealing to Bob than the previous one.
* **Signal a willingness to close the deal:** This offer suggests that I'm serious about closing the deal and am ready to make a final compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects, I can still adjust my price down slightly in the next round, but I'm nearing my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly is low. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a much higher profit than Bob's offer.

Although I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of further negotiation resulting in a lower price is too high.  Selling to John is the most rational and profitable choice at this point."
