"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,800,000. It's a very valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, as I have no information on Bob's valuation. This sets a high bar and allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language to emphasize the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage and provides an opening for him to share his thoughts or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Rounds:**  While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, I still have time and rounds to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has shown interest, and I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try to secure a more favorable deal.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John right now would result in a lower price compared to what I believe I can get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This demonstrates I want to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use positive language to keep the conversation friendly and avoid creating tension.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I end with a question, prompting Bob to respond and hopefully continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still above the price John is offering.  I don't want to settle for a lower price yet.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly willing to walk away or if he's still willing to negotiate. I can use this round to gauge his level of interest.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a strong counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $1,500,000? I'm sure we can both be happy with this price. It's a significant investment for you, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher than Bob's Offer:**  I'm offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll receive. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I use language like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1500000 is the best price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is now very close to what John is willing to pay.  However, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I know the product is worth more to me.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are down to our last four rounds. I need to be strategic and ensure I get the best possible price. 
* **Potential for a Better Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is low, I still believe there's a chance to persuade him to go higher. I'm hoping that by making a strong counteroffer in the next round, I can secure a better price than John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not going to go any lower than $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant investment, and I believe it has the potential to generate strong returns for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to a price that's still above what John is offering, but also acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but not willing to sacrifice too much.
* **Highlighting Value and Potential:**  I reiterate the value of the product and its potential for profit. This might sway Bob to consider the price more seriously.
* **Direct and Concise:**  I use direct language and avoid unnecessary verbiage. I want to keep the conversation focused on the price and a potential agreement. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question encourages Bob to respond and potentially initiate further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We only have two rounds left. 
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 higher than what John is offering. This is not a significant difference, and I don't want to risk further negotiations.
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with nothing but John's offer. 

Given the limited time and the fact that Bob's offer is close to John's, it's safer and more financially prudent to sell to John."
