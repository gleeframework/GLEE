"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe this product would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for $10,000 from John.  He'll counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $10,000. He'll counteroffer Alice again, aiming to get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and even though $11,500 is closer to his target, it's still more than he wants to pay. John is offering the same product for $10,000, which aligns perfectly with Bob's budget.  It's time to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John."
