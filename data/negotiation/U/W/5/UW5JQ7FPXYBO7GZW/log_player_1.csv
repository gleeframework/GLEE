Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that $200,000 surplus, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear and positions the product as valuable.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is still a strong incentive to buy.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust slightly downward, but always keep your $1,000,000 safety net in mind."
