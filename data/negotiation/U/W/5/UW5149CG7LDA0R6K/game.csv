"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1250000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial starting point.  I'm open to discussion, but I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1250000 at this stage. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This reflects the fair market value and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'd accept $1175000 for the product. This allows for a good margin for you and still ensures a worthwhile return for me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
