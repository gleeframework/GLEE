"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1250000 at this stage. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This reflects the fair market value and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
