""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and presents a substantial saving for Bob compared to its perceived value of $1,000,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a final price that's still very advantageous for us (and better than John's guaranteed offer)."
