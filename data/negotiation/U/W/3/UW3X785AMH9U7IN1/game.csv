"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  That's still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, in my opinion.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,112,500. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. While I appreciate you moving, I think I can only do $1,093,750. It's a tough market out there!",1093750.0,Bob,6,
