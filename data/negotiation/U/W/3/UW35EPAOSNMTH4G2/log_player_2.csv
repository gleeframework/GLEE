{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This also sets a baseline for future negotiations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price.  There's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still holding firm on my desired price range. I'm aiming for a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still a bit too high.  We've only got a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal if I keep pushing. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further in the next round to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to my preferred price, but there's still room for a small adjustment.  Increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount signals my willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget.  With only two rounds left, this could be a final push to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round before I'm forced to buy from John for a higher price. Alice's offer is still slightly above my target, but it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it. It's a better deal than going with John, and it represents a decent compromise."
