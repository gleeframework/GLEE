"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $750000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. ",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $750000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $725000. Can you meet me at that price?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $725000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further to $740000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",740000.0,Alice,5,
