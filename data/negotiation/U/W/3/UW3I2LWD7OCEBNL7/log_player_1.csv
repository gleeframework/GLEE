{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob to consider my offer. 

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for flexibility and negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  Selling to John would be a better option right now.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to potentially reach a higher price with Bob.** While he's currently offering less than my minimum, I can try to push him closer to my target.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $11,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counter-offer that's still above my minimum acceptable price but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my counter-offer and pushing him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm using language that indicates I'm open to finding a middle ground, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counter-offer aims to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price while keeping the negotiation alive and potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  This means selling to Bob would be more profitable than selling to John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.** Bob has already shown his willingness to compromise, and pushing him further could risk losing the deal altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale above my minimum and avoid the risk of losing a potential buyer."
