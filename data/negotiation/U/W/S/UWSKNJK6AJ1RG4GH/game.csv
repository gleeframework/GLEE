"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth $1,200,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to secure it at a competitive price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,115,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
