I'm starting with a high price, as it's worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also indicates that I'm not desperate to sell. I believe $950,000 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target and it's a good price considering I could still sell to John for $800,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
