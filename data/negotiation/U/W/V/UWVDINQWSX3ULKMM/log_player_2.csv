"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you for $9,500. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I aim to ensure both parties gain from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, it's still above your target.  You have a better option with John, so it's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
