Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
