"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit too high for me, though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** By starting low, we can see how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she immediately rejects this offer, it might indicate a tougher negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the option to go with John for $1,000,000.  By starting at $800,000, we aim for a significant saving, but are still below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** Alice dropped her price by $300,000, which shows some willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Too High:** $2,000,000 is still double our budget and far higher than our fallback option with John.
* **Continued Negotiation:** We need to show Alice we're serious but won't budge easily from our price range.  Another counteroffer is needed to move the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. This product would be really valuable for me, but I have a firm budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  We're now matching John's offer, signaling to Alice that this is our limit. Using phrases like ""firm budget"" and ""final offer"" emphasizes this point.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the product's value to us, but emphasize our budget limitations. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** By holding firm at our maximum budget, we risk Alice walking away. However, this firm stance is often necessary to secure the best possible price in a negotiation."
