"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit too high for me, though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. This product would be really valuable for me, but I have a firm budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
