"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $85 is a bit lower than what I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still leaves me with a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about $90?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
