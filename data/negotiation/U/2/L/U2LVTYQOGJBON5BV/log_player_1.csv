{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $17,000. It's in excellent condition and has a lot of value to offer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the interaction, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000?  That's a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still stuck at $15,000. It's my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already tried to meet him halfway. While I'd prefer to make a bit more, it's not worth risking losing the sale completely. I'll accept John's offer and sell to him."
