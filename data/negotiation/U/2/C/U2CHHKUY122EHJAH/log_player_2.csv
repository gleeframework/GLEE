Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle again at $81? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $81.  At this point, the potential savings of a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate aren't worth the risk of her accepting another offer or me needing to buy from John at $100."
