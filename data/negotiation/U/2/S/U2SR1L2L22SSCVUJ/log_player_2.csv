"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it quite valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice. By rejecting the initial offer, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price. There's no downside to rejecting the offer at this stage, as you can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's a starting point for discussion and sets the stage for a back-and-forth process.  A $300,000 reduction is a substantial proposition, but still within your budget, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest.  While $900000 is a good starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $900,000. It's worth exploring if you can get Alice to come down further. Remember, buying from John is always an option if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating your willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still pushing for a better deal. It's a reasonable midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it sets the stage for a potential agreement.  The $50,000 difference offers Alice a small margin, making it less likely she'll reject outright."
