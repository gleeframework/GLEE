Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that far. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.

Alice has met you precisely in the middle.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and it risks alienating Alice or running out of rounds. This is a good deal!"
