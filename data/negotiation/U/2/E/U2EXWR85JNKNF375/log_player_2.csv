"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. While this is above your estimated value, I believe the true potential and benefits you'll reap will far outweigh the initial investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this deal go through. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I've been transparent that this product holds significant value, and letting it go for anything less than $1,500,000 would be a loss for me. I'm willing to accept that loss to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,500,000.  While the product might be worth more to you, your absolute maximum is $1,000,000. John offers a guaranteed deal at your maximum budget. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal."
