"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. While this is above your estimated value, I believe the true potential and benefits you'll reap will far outweigh the initial investment. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong anchor price. This leaves room for concessions and can potentially lead to a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits specifically tailored to Bob's needs, we aim to justify the high asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
 
This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while staying far above both his valuation and our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  We have room to negotiate and will aim for a price closer to his valuation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this deal go through. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** While we are making a substantial price reduction to show flexibility, we are still holding firm significantly above Bob's offer. This signals that we are serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** We are reiterating the product's value to keep Bob focused on its benefits beyond just the price. 
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually agreeable solution rather than engage in aggressive haggling. 

We are strategically moving closer to Bob's valuation while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum is $1,000,000. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his maximum willingness to pay, which is still below our minimum acceptable price. However, it's close enough that we might be able to bridge the gap with a carefully crafted counteroffer. Selling to John guarantees our minimum but might leave potential profit on the table. We'll negotiate one more time before deciding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I've been transparent that this product holds significant value, and letting it go for anything less than $1,500,000 would be a loss for me. I'm willing to accept that loss to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as our non-negotiable bottom line, we create a sense of urgency and importance. 
* **Justification:**  We are transparently explaining our reasoning for the price, emphasizing that we are making a significant concession. 
* **Compromise:**  We are meeting Bob halfway between his final offer and our initial asking price, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal.

This approach applies pressure on Bob to accept while still maintaining the possibility of walking away with our guaranteed offer from John."
