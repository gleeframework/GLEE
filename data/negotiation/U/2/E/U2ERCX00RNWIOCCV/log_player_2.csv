"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is trying to leverage the fact that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Bob can get it for $10,000 from John. There's no reason to pay the extra $500."
