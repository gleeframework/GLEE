"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $107.50. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $106, which is closer to what I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell it to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $108 is still more than I can comfortably spend. How about $107? This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can sell it to you for $109. It's the last offer I can make before I consider other options.",109.0,Alice,7,
