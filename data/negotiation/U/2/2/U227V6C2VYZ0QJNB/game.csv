"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $85?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $90, but $85 is still a bit steep for me. How about $75? I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $82.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $78? I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $78 is still too low for me.  To make this quick, I'm willing to go down to $80. This is my final offer, and I don't think we need to go back and forth anymore.",80.0,Alice,7,
