"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $135 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about $145? That's a significant drop from my initial offer, and it's closer to your price point.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my absolute limit.",130.0,Bob,6,
