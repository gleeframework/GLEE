Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to him, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm  countering with $975,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more than his offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer my initial price, $960,000 is a good deal.  It's closer to my desired price point and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a sale to John."
