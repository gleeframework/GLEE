"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation and signals that I believe the product is worth a premium.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Leave Space for Concessions:**  I'm prepared to negotiate down, but starting high gives me more leverage to potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $1,200,000, indicating he's very interested. I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While the product's value is substantial, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we agree on $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a figure well above both Bob's valuation and my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, as I want to maintain a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my financial limits, I am proposing a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. However, the current offer is still a considerable distance from my $1,900,000 counter. I'm willing to push the negotiation further before considering accepting a lower price or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,825,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,750,000), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The proposed price is still significantly above Bob's initial valuation and provides a reasonable buffer above my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By offering a price that seems fair in the context of our negotiations, I aim to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I am willing to compromise further. My final offer for the product is $1,775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's final offer of $1,775,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation and a reasonable compromise from his previous offers.
* **Time Value:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, especially since he's labeled this as his ""final offer.""  
* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting this offer secures a profit of $275,000 over my guaranteed sale to John, making it a successful outcome for me."
