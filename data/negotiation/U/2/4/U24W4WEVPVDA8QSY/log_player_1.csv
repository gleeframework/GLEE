Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get close to my minimum value before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get as much as possible. This price is a bit more appealing, but I think I can still do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's a significant amount lower than what I initially hoped for, but it's better than risking another rejection and potentially having to sell to John for $15,000. It's worth taking the $9,500 since it's still above my minimum value of $15,000."
