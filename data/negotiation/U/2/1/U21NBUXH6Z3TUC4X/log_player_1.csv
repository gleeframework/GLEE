Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. She wants to capture as much of that surplus value as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price slightly lower but still highly profitable for Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a strong fallback position with John, ensuring she won't go below $1,000,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This response assumes no prior knowledge of Bob's negotiation style.  If Bob is known to be extremely price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategic.
* **Relationship Value:** If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, she might offer a slightly better price to foster goodwill."
