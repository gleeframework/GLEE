Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, as I know John will buy it for that amount. This lets Bob know my starting point and encourages him to negotiate if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my ideal price. At this point, further negotiation might not be worth the time, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
