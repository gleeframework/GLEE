"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll start by rejecting Alice's offer.  I'm hoping to get a lower price, and I still have room to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Alice's offer again.  $110 is still a bit more than I want to pay, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get the price down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer of $109.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, I'm starting to run out of time.  If I reject this offer and counter again, I risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  At $109, I'm still getting a decent deal and saving money compared to buying from John."
