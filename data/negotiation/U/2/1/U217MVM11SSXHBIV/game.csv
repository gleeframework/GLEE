,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you and a great deal for me.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",109.0,Alice,5,
