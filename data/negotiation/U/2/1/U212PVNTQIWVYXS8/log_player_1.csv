Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gets you a profit beyond your minimum. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage to push for a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start by aiming higher than Bob's perceived value but leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" justifying the price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John is your safety net) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $150,000 more than your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer, and you can decide if you want to meet him somewhere in between. 
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's responses."
