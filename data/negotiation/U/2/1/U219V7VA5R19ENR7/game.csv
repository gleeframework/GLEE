"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify paying $20,000 for it. Considering my budget and the current market value, I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you be open to discussing this further?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still a bit too high for you. I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still believe we can find a better fit within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $14,000 for the product?",14000.0,Bob,4,
