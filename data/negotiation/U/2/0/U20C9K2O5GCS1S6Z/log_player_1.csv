Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 would be more realistic.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and allows me to meet some of your needs while remaining fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
