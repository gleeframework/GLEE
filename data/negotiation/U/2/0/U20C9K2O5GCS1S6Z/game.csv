"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and allows me to meet some of your needs while remaining fair to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
