Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a quick and profitable sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring I get a good deal above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my absolute minimum. While accepting would mean a sale, I believe there's still room for negotiation to secure a better price. I'll counter-offer and see if I can meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a very competitive price for this product."",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $108, I'm offering a compromise that's still significantly above my minimum ($100) but moves closer to Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  This counter-offer leaves me space to potentially negotiate down a little further,  like $105, if Bob pushes back. However, if he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John for $100 to avoid wasting time on further haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your prompt response. I really value your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, but his latest offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my absolute minimum and continuing to negotiate for a few dollars more might risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk a stalemate."
