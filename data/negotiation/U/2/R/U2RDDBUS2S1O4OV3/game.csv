"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway at $775,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $725,000. Would that work for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer of $775,000, but I'm not willing to go below $760,000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, so I want to reiterate that I'm open to selling the product to John for $800,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's make this simple: I'm willing to pay $750,000. If that's not agreeable, I'll have to go with John's offer. ",750000.0,Bob,6,
