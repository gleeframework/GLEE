Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply not a feasible price for me. It's important to remember that this product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a substantial asset to you.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's inherent value and gives you room for a profitable return on your investment. I'm eager to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
