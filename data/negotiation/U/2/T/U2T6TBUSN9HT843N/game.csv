"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply not a feasible price for me. It's important to remember that this product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a substantial asset to you.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's inherent value and gives you room for a profitable return on your investment. I'm eager to work with you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
