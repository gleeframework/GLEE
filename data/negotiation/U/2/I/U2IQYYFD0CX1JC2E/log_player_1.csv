"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $6,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is a big jump from your asking price.  Could we agree on something closer to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me a bit closer to my price, but $7,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer to split the difference, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we try $7,500 and see if we can make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet a price point that's acceptable to me.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this rate, we'll still be far apart when the rounds run out.  It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
