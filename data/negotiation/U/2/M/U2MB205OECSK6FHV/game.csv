"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a game-changer, and I know you'll see its value. My starting price is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential it holds for your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I'm hoping to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant potential this product holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the market price. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. This is getting close to what I'm comfortable with. Let's call it $1,000,000. This is a final offer from me, as I'm confident you'll see the value this product holds for your business. If it's not a match for you at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the negotiations we've had so far.",980000.0,Bob,6,
