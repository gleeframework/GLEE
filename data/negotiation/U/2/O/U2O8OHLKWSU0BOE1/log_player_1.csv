Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable to you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation friendly and build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention that the product is valuable to me, implying its worth. This subtly suggests that the price is fair.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer, if any.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 I initially proposed.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 would be the safest option, but I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $11,000, keeping in mind that I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to reiterate its worth and justify the price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I use language that suggests a fair compromise, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his next move. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $11,000. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $9,500.
* **Risk of Losing More:** Further negotiation might result in a lower offer from Bob or a breakdown in negotiations altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is more profitable, it's important to consider the potential time and effort involved in finding another buyer. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale with minimal hassle.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and proceed with the sale. I'll focus on ensuring a smooth transaction and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob for potential future business."
