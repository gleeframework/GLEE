"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $17,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,500?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $16,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,5,
