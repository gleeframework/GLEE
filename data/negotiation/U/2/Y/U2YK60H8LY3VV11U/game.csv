"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.
