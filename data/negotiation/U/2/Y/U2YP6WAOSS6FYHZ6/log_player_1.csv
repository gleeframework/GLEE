Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might undervalue the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (John in this case) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, ideally close to $1,300,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a high chance of securing a price significantly higher than his perceived value and potentially closer to your guaranteed sale price with John."
