"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $150, and knows Alice values the product at $120. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, aiming to split the difference between Alice's offer and his own valuation.  He's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate but also making it clear he's serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up her price, but Bob is still in a better position. He can likely negotiate a lower price, and even if he doesn't get his ideal price, it's still better than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to split the difference. He's demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price that's favorable to him. Since Alice rejected his previous offer, he's willing to slightly increase his offer but only to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is very close to Bob's previous counteroffer of $130. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price. Buying from John for $150 is a worse deal.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
