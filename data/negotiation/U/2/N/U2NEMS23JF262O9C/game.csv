,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1525000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you."
"I've thought it through, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1500000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,,
