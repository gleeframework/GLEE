"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the deal for Bob by mentioning the value of the product to him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible without losing the deal. By starting high, I give myself room to negotiate down, while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a major loss. While I could potentially negotiate with him further, I don't want to waste too much time with someone who is unwilling to pay a fair price.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will give me a better chance of getting a more favorable outcome. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John at any time for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable compromise:** I'm offering a lower price, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the farm.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him see the potential in accepting my offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a reasonable compromise and emphasizing the value, I aim to move closer to my desired price without completely shutting down negotiations. My goal is to get Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm prepared to accept a slightly lower price if it means closing the deal sooner. If he rejects this offer again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully, including potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to remain firm on my bottom line and try to push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John at any time for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's important to balance the need to make a deal with ensuring I get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 just isn't viable for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $800,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the value of the product to him. 
* **Urgency and closing:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting closing the deal and moving forward.  This subtly encourages Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that by splitting the difference and emphasizing the value, I can convince Bob to accept this offer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to consider my options more carefully, including potentially selling to John."
