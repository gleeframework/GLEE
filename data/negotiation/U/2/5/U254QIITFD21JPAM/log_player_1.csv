Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, the message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his perceived worth.
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from overthinking or shopping around. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 

* **If Bob accepts:** Alice gets a fantastic deal, exceeding her minimum by $3,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** Alice can always fall back on John's offer, ensuring she still receives her minimum desired price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still having a secure backup option."
