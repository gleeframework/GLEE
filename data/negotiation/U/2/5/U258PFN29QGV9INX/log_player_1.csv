Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a slightly higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your position, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $87.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
