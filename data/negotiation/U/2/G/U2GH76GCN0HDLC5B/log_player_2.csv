"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm aiming to pay significantly less.
* I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I have time to try and get a better price. 
* I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research and the product's market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. While it's a step in the right direction, I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.
* I have more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,125,000 is still above my budget though. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and market conditions. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is appealing, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my target, but it's still a bit high. 
* I have more rounds to negotiate and I want to see if I can push for a lower price. 
* I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
