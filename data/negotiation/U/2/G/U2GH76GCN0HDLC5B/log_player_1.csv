"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research and the product's market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,125,000 is still above my budget though. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and market conditions. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $950,000, but that's still significantly more than John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is appealing, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. Let's try $1,000,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met us at our desired compromise of $1,000,000. This is a significant profit above John's offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
