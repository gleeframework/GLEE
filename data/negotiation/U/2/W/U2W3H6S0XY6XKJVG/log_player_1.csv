"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Reasoning:**  I want to give myself room to negotiate downwards. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving me the chance to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm starting the conversation on a friendly and optimistic note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still reflects the product's true value, and it gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price, but only by a small amount. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** My goal is to find a compromise that allows me to earn more than Bob's initial offer while still leaving room for potential negotiation in future rounds.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and focusing on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee I'll be successful.  I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with nothing. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
