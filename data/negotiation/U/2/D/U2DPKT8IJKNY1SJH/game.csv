"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a great price for you, considering you value the product at $10,000.  Let's close this deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,
