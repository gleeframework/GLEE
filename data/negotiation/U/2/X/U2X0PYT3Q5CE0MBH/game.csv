"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  Could you consider a price of $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $14,000 is cutting it a bit close. How about we settle at $16,500? This reflects the true value of the product while still being a fair deal for you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,750?",15750.0,Bob,6,
