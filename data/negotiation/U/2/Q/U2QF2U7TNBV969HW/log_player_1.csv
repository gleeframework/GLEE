Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price of $120.  This is a good strategy because:

* **It establishes my value:** It signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If he counters, it gives me space to come down a little bit without feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Protection:** If he rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I'm not comfortable selling below my minimum of $120. 
* **Room for compromise:** While $110 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer with another counteroffer.
* **John as backup:** I have John as a safety net if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115.  Here's why:

* **Midpoint:** This is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Sign of flexibility:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still holding firm on getting a good price.
* **Still above my minimum:** I'm not willing to go below my minimum price, and this offer gives me room to potentially meet Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Here's why:

* **Still above my minimum:** While getting closer to my minimum, $108 is still not acceptable.
* **John is a better option:** John is willing to pay my minimum, which is a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

It's possible to keep negotiating with Bob, but the risk of getting a lower price is high. With John's offer, I can guarantee my minimum value and avoid any further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112.  Here's why:

* **One more try:** I want to give Bob one more chance to meet me in the middle.
* **Almost there:** This price is very close to my minimum. 
* **John is still an option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John. 

If this counteroffer doesn't work, I'm ready to move on and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Here's why:

* **Minimum value:** I'm guaranteed to get my minimum price of $120 with John.
* **Limited negotiation:** Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but the difference is still significant.
* **Risk of lower price:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting a lower price than I can get from John.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, securing my minimum value and avoiding further negotiation is the most sensible option at this point."
