"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to try negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! Unfortunately, $90 is a bit over my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) than Alice's initial price ($90). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer (being over budget), which can help facilitate a more understanding negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $75. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $75 is still above your target price. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to $70, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving some room for potential further negotiation in case Alice rejects this offer as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not quite comfortable with $70, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $72. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Close Enough:** $72 is a reasonable price, and it's only $8 less than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves time and potential frustration of further back-and-forth."
