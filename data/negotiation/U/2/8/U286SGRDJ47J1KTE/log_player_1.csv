Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly below my minimum ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's also a substantial profit for me if he accepts. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and requesting a quick decision might encourage Bob to act fast. 

**Important Note:** This assumes I cannot negotiate with John or reveal his offer to Bob."
