"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high quality and unique features, I estimate its value to be well above $10000. To ensure we're on the same page about its potential impact, I propose a starting price of $25000. This reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the strategic benefits it could bring to your company. I look forward to discussing this further with you.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $25000 is above my budget.  Given my maximum price point is $15000, I'd like to propose a price of $15000 to start the negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. Considering the value and capabilities of our product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $20000. This price reflects the product's quality, its potential impact on your business, and the market conditions. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know if this proposal works for you, and we can continue our conversation.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is still higher than my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $17500.  This reflects a compromise on both sides and allows us to potentially finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Bob,4,
