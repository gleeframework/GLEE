"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and the product's worth to her ($12,000).  It's highly unlikely you'll reach a mutually agreeable price if you start this high. Rejecting her offer and providing a counteroffer significantly closer to your budget is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000), we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial lowball offer gives us space to gradually increase our bid if needed, while still remaining well below our $8,000 maximum.
* **Direct & Clear Communication:** We're being transparent about our budget limitations without revealing our absolute maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $10,500 is still significantly higher than your target price and even above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering again, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate but also reinforce your budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're raising our offer to $7,500, demonstrating willingness to compromise but staying firmly below our $8,000 limit.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This offer aims to bridge the gap between Alice's $10,500 and our previous $6,000.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  We want to keep the negotiation amicable and collaborative, emphasizing our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but her current offer of $9,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory result. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It makes more sense to secure the product at your target price than risk exceeding your budget."
