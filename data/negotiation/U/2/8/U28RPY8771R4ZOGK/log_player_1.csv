``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

$9,800 is a good price, close to what I was hoping for, and significantly better than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
