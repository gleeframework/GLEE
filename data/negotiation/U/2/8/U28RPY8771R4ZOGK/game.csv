"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",9800.0,Bob,4,
