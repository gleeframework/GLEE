"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum potential profit. This will give me a good understanding of Bob's interest level and potentially motivate him to counteroffer.  I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial goal. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still getting closer to my desired price. It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would like to get closer to $950,000, Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. This price is significantly higher than John's offer, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal."
