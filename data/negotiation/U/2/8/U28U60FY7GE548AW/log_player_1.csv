Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since John is willing to pay $120, I can afford to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better.  While $105 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
