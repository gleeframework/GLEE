"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $680,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",680000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $660,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and it's still within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $665,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",665000.0,Alice,7,
