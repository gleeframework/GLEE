"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product for a price I'm comfortable with.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. How about we meet at $130? That's a bit closer to what I'm willing to pay.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make at least $135 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference and go with $135. It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,6,
