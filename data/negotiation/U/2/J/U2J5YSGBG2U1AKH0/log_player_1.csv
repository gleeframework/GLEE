Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product for a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 4
