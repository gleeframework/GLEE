"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it would be just as valuable to you. To start, I'm willing to sell it for $900000.  Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be happy to accept $850000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? This is my final offer, I really want this product but my budget is tight. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
