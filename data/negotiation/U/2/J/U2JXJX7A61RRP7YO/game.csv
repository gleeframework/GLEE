"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90? That seems fair to me, and it's still a good deal for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! $90 is closer to where I was hoping to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $95. However, I'm still a little over my budget.  Let's try $92. It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to finally get the product.",92.0,Bob,4,
