{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm starting with a friendly approach, expressing my belief in the product's value for Bob. I'm also setting the initial price high but immediately signaling openness to negotiation. 
* **Product Price:** I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. Starting high allows me to potentially get a better deal than selling to John. By being open to negotiation, I'm hoping to engage Bob in a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90? That seems fair to me, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm also confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, considering he expressed a willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still below my initial offer. This will show I'm serious about making a deal with him, while also maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! $90 is closer to where I was hoping to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing appreciation. I'm also trying to build a rapport by highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for him.  I'm proposing a compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers. 
* **Product Price:** $95 is my counteroffer. It's above Bob's offer, but still below my initial price, showing my flexibility. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

*  **Maintain my profit:** $95 is within my acceptable range.
* **Show flexibility:**  By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Encourage a deal:** This price might be attractive enough for Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $95. However, I'm still a little over my budget.  Let's try $92. It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to finally get the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is still below my minimum desired price of $100, it's getting very close. At this point, I need to weigh the following:

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate has shown he's genuinely interested, but there's no guarantee he'll budge further.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I'd be left with the option of selling to John for $100. 
* **Time factor:**  The back-and-forth is taking time, and I might not want to risk losing the sale to another potential buyer who could emerge while I'm negotiating with Bob.

Considering these factors, I believe accepting Bob's offer of $92 is the best option at this point. It's a decent profit, and I can't be sure if I can get a better deal with him."
