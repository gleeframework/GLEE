"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
