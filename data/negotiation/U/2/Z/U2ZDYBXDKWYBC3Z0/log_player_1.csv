{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, but also shows I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount, there's no need to risk further negotiations and potential rejection.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,000."
