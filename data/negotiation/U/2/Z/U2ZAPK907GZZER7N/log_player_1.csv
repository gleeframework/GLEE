Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  Bob's offer is very low, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept his low offer right away.  I'm also emphasizing that $125 is still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy it without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my desired price, and it's a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely or that I might end up selling to John for $100. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
