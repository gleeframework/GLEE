"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what I would get from John, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  There's no point in risking a further negotiation and potentially getting less. I'll take the deal!"
