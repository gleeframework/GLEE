Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from our agreed-upon price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  We'll proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still a bit far from our agreed-upon price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're getting close, but $1,400,000 is still below our minimum. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's clear Bob is not willing to meet our minimum price.  He's dropped his offer significantly, and it seems unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000. To avoid further time investment and potential losses, it's best to sell the product to John, who's offering our desired price."
