"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best value for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000 is a bit too low, but $1100000 is a more reasonable starting point for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the best price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1150000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to a fair price. However, I still need to prioritize getting the best value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at $1100000. That's my final offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that this is your last offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1060000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1060000.0,Bob,10,
