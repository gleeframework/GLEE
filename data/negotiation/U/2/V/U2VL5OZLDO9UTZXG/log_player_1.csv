Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $950,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a very desirable product and I want to make a deal.  How about we split the difference and close at $987,500?

Bob is clearly committed to purchasing and his offer is now very close to my guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of risk and reward at this point in the negotiation."
