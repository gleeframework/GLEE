"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said,  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a very desirable product and I want to make a deal.  How about we split the difference and close at $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
