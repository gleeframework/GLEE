Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value to me and the potential profit you could still make. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
