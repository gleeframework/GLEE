Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $950,000 is well above your $800,000 floor, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000), making it more likely he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a potential $50,000 gap for both parties to work with.

This offer allows you to start the negotiation strong, but also leaves open the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's not worth it to accept such a low offer, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $800,000. It's better to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is above Bob's offer:** $850,000 is higher than Bob's offer of $700,000, showing I am willing to negotiate but not at a drastically low price.
* **Is below my initial offer:** It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Is still above my minimum acceptable price:** $850,000 is more than my $800,000 floor, ensuring I don't lose money.

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while keeping my interests protected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, falling well below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Bob won't lead to a favorable outcome.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $800,000, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
