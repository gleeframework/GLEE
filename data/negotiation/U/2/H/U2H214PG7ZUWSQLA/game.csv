"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $16,500? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $16,000 for the product.
