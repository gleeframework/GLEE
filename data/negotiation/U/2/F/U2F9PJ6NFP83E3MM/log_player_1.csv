"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for concessions and makes it more likely to settle closer to your target.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,""  we subtly hint at the product's worth without directly revealing our bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" clearly signals our willingness to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  There's potential to secure a better deal with Bob before settling for our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the significant value I place on this product."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession of $100,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Holding Firm (For Now):**  We're still significantly above both Bob's offer and John's offer, aiming to leave room for further negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,300,000 is a strong profit, exceeding our guaranteed price from John by $100,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly moving closer to our range. Accepting now avoids the risk of him withdrawing or future offers being less favorable. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a good deal now has its advantages.  There's always a slight risk of unforeseen circumstances."
