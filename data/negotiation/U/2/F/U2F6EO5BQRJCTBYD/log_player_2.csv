"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, and John is offering it at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no incentive to negotiate with Alice, as you've already reached your price ceiling."
