Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This offer is a strategic move:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him incentive to consider the offer, as he's still getting a deal.
* **It's lower than your valuation:** This allows you to still make a profit, albeit less than selling to John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some wiggle room to potentially increase the price.

Ultimately, this offer balances your desire for profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you having to sell to John at your minimum price."
