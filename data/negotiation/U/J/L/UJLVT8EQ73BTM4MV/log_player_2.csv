"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but unfortunately, my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $10200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price, or he can always choose to buy from John for his budget price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,200 is still a bit out of my budget.  Could we settle at $9,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will come down much further, especially since she's already made multiple concessions.  Buying from John for $8,000 is the most cost-effective option for Bob, allowing him to stay within his budget and secure the product."
