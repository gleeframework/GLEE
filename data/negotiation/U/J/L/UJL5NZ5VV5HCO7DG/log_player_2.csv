"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, it makes more sense for him to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice will likely only result in a price that is still too high for Bob."
