Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll be watching closely for his reaction and will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I need to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob while keeping my profit high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his initial offer. While I could continue negotiating, it seems unlikely he'll budge much further. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to move on."
