"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the opportunity for you to still make a significant profit.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that should balance our interests and allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget, while ensuring you still realize a good profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also considering the value you're placing on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
