"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob offered $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I can also sell the product to John for the same price.  Since there's no difference in profit, it makes sense to sell to John immediately, avoiding further negotiation and potential delays."
