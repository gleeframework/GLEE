"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a significant profit. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum desired price of $15,000 while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe I can still get closer to my target through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still above Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to consider while still leaving me some room to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a better deal. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I could potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,750. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough to tempt Bob into accepting, as it's significantly closer to his offer, and it's only $250 away from my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal. I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. We're very close now, and this offer splits the difference between our last two offers.  I believe this is a fair and appealing compromise for Bob, and it's only $500 away from my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to close the deal with Bob. Even if I counter with a lower price, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and I'm not willing to drop my price significantly further. It's better to secure the sale with John at my desired price of $15,000."
