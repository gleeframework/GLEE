Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,""  Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at other potential buyers (""listing it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
