{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum price of $80.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $105 is still a good deal.  It's a significant profit for me and likely the best I'll get from Bob. Accepting his offer means I don't risk losing the sale and ending up with just $80 from John."
