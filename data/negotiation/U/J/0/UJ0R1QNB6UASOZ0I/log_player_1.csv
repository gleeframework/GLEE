Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your profit, and selling to Bob allows you to potentially earn significantly more than your alternative offer from John ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $925,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive.
    * It's considerably above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept quickly."
