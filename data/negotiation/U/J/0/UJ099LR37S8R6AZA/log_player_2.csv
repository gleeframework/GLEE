"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $14,000 is still above my budget and what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my limit but trying to leave some room for negotiation, as it seems Alice might be willing to settle somewhere between our current prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about making a deal, and I may need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is signaling she won't budge much further, and I'm not confident we can reach a deal within my budget. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at $12,000."
