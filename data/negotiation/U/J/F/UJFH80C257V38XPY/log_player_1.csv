Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, I've potentially left money on the table. If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. I won't feel pressured to accept any offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to his perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). I'm better off rejecting and proposing a counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll still be able to sell to John for my minimum if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product to me is quite high. I could consider letting it go for $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price to meet Bob somewhere in the middle of our previous positions. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $11,000 price is still above my absolute minimum, ensuring a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still a small margin for further negotiation if Bob pushes back, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I am comfortable to pay up to $10,500 for this product. I hope this revised offer aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
