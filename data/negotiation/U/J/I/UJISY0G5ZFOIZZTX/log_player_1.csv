Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price above my minimum acceptable value ($150) and a bit above what I think Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for some back-and-forth and potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm trying to create a friendly atmosphere to encourage negotiation rather than a hostile one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, he's showing interest in the product. This means there's room for negotiation.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $60 is just way too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, but not by much. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product. 
* **Realistic Price:**  $125 is still significantly above Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:**  I'm trying to keep the communication positive to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $75 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150, and even lower than my previous counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:** Bob has made it clear that $75 is his maximum, and I'm unlikely to get a better price from him.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoid the risk of further negotiation. 

While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, the risk of ending up with a price lower than John's offer outweighs the potential benefits of reaching a deal with Bob."
