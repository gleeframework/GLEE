Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To be candid, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000 for this purchase. If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.

While Bob's latest offer is closer to his actual valuation, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and my goal is to maximize profit.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price."
