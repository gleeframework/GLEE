Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can do better, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $900,000 right now. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However,  $862500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $840000, which represents a fair middle ground.  This price allows us both to benefit from this deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's clear that Bob is not going to come up to my desired price, and with only two rounds left, the risk of getting a lower offer is too high. John is a sure thing, and I can't afford to miss out on that guaranteed income."
