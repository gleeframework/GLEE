"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $825000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $862500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",862500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $840000 is closer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Let's compromise at $850000.  This price is fair to both of us and would allow us to close this deal successfully.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,7,
