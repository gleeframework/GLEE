Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, while still potentially making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes sense to accept his offer. This guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
