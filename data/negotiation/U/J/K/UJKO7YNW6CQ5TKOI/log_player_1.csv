Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price, while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I believe I can get a better price than that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $125. This is still a good price for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $100.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
