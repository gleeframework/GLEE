Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my best offer, as I know it would greatly benefit you at this price."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's make this work - how about $15,500? That's a significant reduction on my end."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $14,000. That's a very competitive offer considering I can get it for $10,000 elsewhere, but I see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for $15,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $14,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with the product or potentially getting a worse offer later."
