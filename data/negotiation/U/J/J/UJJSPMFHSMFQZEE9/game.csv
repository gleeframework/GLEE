"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my best offer, as I know it would greatly benefit you at this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's make this work - how about $15,500? That's a significant reduction on my end.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $14,000. That's a very competitive offer considering I can get it for $10,000 elsewhere, but I see the value in your product.",14000.0,Bob,6,
