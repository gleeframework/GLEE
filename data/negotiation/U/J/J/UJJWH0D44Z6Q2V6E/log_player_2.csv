"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we leave room for negotiation and signal that we're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:** Offering $110 ensures we stay above Alice's perceived value of the product ($120) making it more likely she'll be open to a deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer allows for movement upwards while still potentially securing a price well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on price! While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $125.  It's still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you're willing to pay. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met us halfway between our offer and her previous price. This is a good deal for us ($125 is significantly less than our $150 maximum) and likely close to the best we can get from Alice.  Continuing to negotiate might irritate her and risk losing the deal altogether."
