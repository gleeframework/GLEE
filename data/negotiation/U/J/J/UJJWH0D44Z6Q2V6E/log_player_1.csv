Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being lowballed. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone sets the stage for a positive interaction and encourages Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've earned a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting. I'll also need to consider how much time I want to invest in further negotiation. If his counteroffer is too low or if I'm not feeling confident, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least get closer to my minimum.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his offer and my minimum. I might consider something like $125 or $130, depending on how confident I am in my negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on price! While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $125.  It's still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you're willing to pay. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is above minimum:**  $125 is higher than my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Appeals to value:**  I remind Bob that $125 is still lower than his perceived value of $150.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and determine if I should continue negotiating or move on to John."
