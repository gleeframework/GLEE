Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it, but I need to make sure I can afford it. Can you think about it?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my desired price, $10,800 is still a good deal and better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's important to remember that negotiation is a give and take, and sometimes you have to settle for a slightly lower price to secure the sale."
