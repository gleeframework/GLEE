Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a price that is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives Bob a good deal as he values the product at $10,000.  

By offering a price slightly lower than my guaranteed sale price to John, I am increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer. It also ensures that even if Bob rejects the offer, I can still get my minimum desired value by selling to John."
