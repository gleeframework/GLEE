{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a message along with the price, you establish a friendly tone and open the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price and is a reasonable compromise.  I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
