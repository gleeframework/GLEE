Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,080,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value at $1,120,000.  Let's make a deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,060,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable profit margin, it's still too early to settle.  His ""final offer"" language is likely a negotiation tactic, and there's room to push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also know the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - $1,090,000. This is my final offer, let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $1,090,000, we're meeting Bob exactly in the middle of his last offer ($1,060,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,120,000).  This often feels like a fair compromise to both parties.
2. **Finality:** Stating ""this is my final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency. It signals to Bob that we're serious and not willing to budge further, potentially pushing him to accept. 
3. **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Setting a firm limit now allows us to gauge his seriousness and pivot to John if needed, still leaving us with options."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is consistently lowering his offer in increments of $10,000. This suggests he has some wiggle room and his ""final offer"" claims are part of his negotiation tactic. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While $1,050,000 is a significant profit, we are aiming for the best possible deal.  There's still a chance to secure a higher price with a few more rounds. 
* **Calculated Risk:** We still have four rounds remaining and can always fall back on John's offer. This allows us to take a calculated risk and counter Bob's offer again."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting bogged down. I value your time and I'm sure you value mine. Let's cut to the chase. I'm willing to accept $1,070,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Do we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1070000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  After several rounds, it's time to shift to a more direct and firm negotiation style.  This message conveys a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Final Offer Emphasis:**  By stating a price and calling it our ""absolute bottom line,"" we are making it clear that this is our final concession. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  By highlighting the value of time, we subtly pressure Bob to make a decision without explicitly issuing an ultimatum.  
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering $1,070,000 is a calculated concession. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but I'm not willing to go above $1,030,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Pattern:** Bob continues to decrease his offer by $20,000 every other round, deviating from his previous $10,000 increments. This suggests he is less willing to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries a greater risk than reward at this point.  His offers are getting too close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.
* **Time Value:**  We are running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John now than risk Bob's offers potentially dropping even lower in the remaining two rounds."
