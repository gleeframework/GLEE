"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160, still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation. This should encourage him to accept, but it still leaves some room for negotiation if he rejects it again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $155, which is only $5 more than what Bob is offering, and is now within my minimum of $150. I think this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, and if not, I will have the option to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting very close to my minimum, but Bob is still not willing to go higher. It's likely he's stubborn or is trying to wear me down. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees I meet my minimum and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiation."
