"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an exceptional opportunity given its value to you and our confidence in its quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still considerably higher than both your maximum budget and Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and respectful:**  Maintains a positive tone for continued negotiation.
* **Signals interest:**  Shows you're serious about buying but want a better deal.
* **Strategic positioning:**  Starts the negotiation closer to your desired price range, leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept it at $9,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more agreeable price, $10,500 is still above your target. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Continued Negotiation:**  Shows willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Incremental Progress:**  Moves closer to your target price without being overly aggressive. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By now, Alice should realize you have other options and might lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,250. Is this something you could consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller.  $10,250 is a reasonable compromise. It's below your $15,000 walk-away point and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting now secures the product at a decent price."
