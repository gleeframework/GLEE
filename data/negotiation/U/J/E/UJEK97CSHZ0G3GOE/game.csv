"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it, which is fair for both of us. Let's make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm prepared to pay $100 for it.  I know it's not your ideal price, but I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",100.0,Bob,6,
