"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price.  I'm asking for $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than your fallback option."
