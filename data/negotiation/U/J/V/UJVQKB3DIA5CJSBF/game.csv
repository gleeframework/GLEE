"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $750,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $650,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from your original offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $720,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. However, $720,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $710,000 for the product. This is a solid price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",710000.0,Bob,6,
