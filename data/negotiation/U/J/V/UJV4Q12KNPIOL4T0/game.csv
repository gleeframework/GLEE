"I appreciate the gesture, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,045,000, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1045000.0,Alice,7,
