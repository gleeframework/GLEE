"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm confident that this is the best we can do.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that since we're close, we could try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.
