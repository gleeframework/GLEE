Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave Bob feeling like he got a reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,200,000 might scare him off.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is straightforward about the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he wants it. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing you a substantial profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower in the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might be willing to accept a slightly smaller profit margin."
