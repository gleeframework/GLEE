"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $12000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still leaves room for negotiation but is closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14500. This feels like a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
