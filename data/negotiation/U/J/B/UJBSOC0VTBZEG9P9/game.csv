"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is certainly closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. Let's compromise further. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
