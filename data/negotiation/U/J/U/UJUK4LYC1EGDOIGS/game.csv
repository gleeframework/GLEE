"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is considerably higher.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value we each place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
