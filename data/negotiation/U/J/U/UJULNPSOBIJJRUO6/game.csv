"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget in mind. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11500.  This would still be a great price for you, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to go above $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
