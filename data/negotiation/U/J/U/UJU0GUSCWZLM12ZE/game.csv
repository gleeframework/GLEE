"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to come down a bit to make this deal work for both of us?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle on $8500?  It's a good compromise and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8750. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
