"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
