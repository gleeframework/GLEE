Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a better price than selling to John.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I can still try to squeeze a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly unwilling to pay more, and his latest offer is below my minimum value. At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
