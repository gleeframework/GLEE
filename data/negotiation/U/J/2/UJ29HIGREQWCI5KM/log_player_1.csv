"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer of $8,000.  While I need to make a profit, I believe I can get more from Bob by negotiating further.  $10,000 is my minimum, so I won't sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident I can secure at least $10,000, either by negotiating further with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a reasonable profit on this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will ensure that I can continue offering high-quality products like this in the future. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to sell to John. Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risking further negotiation with Bob."
