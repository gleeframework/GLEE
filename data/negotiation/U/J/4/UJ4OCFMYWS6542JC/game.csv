"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a high-value asset at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
