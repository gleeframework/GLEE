"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting, he can potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. It's lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation and allows Bob to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $9,500 is a good price for him, as it is lower than what he would pay to John. While he could continue negotiating, there is no guarantee that he can get a lower price from Alice. Additionally, there is a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he would have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this situation to maximize his savings."
