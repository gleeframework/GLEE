Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant amount above my minimum value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I hope this is enough to reach an agreement without risking losing the sale to John."
