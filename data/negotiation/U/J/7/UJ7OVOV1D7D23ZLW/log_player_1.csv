Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800000. Would you consider reducing the price to $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push for closer to my original asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $925,000. This still allows you a good deal while respecting my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $875000. This is my final offer before considering purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $875,000 is a good deal and I'm concerned that if I reject it, Bob might walk away and I'll be left with John's offer of $800,000."
