"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $90 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
