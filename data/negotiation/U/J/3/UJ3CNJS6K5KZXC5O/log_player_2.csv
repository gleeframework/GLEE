"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and interested tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  We don't want to go too low initially and offend Alice, so $7,000 leaves space for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice came down a bit, $9,000 is still above your target price and significantly above her own valuation of the product. There's no rush to accept yet.
* **Maintain Momentum:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better deal and keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're suggesting a price that meets Alice at her value while still being within your acceptable range. This increases the likelihood of her accepting.
* **Direct and Clear:**  We're being straightforward about our desired price point without being aggressive.
* **Sense of Fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair price"" helps create a more agreeable atmosphere."
