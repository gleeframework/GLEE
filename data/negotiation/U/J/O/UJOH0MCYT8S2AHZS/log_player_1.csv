Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price I think is fair, considering its unique value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. "", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, focusing on the value of the product rather than giving away too much information. This avoids scaring Bob off with a high price.
* **Product Price:** I'm setting the price at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still earning a substantial profit.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By offering a high price but with a friendly message, I hope to pique Bob's interest while leaving room to potentially negotiate down if necessary.  If Bob does reject, I have a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
