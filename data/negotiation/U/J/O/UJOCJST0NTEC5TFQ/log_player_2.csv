"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would really be valuable to you. Given its features, I'm initially pricing it at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product. While I agree it looks valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially land a great deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $6,000, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about the purchase but expect some back-and-forth negotiation. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle - would you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $11,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer. I'll counteroffer again, staying well below my maximum but edging a bit closer to hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** By countering with $7,000, I'm showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate upwards but in smaller increments.
* **Staying Below Budget:** It's important to remain firm and not exceed my $8,000 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but the price gap is still a bit too wide for me.  I could consider coming down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and her tone suggests she's serious about the other buyer.
* **Above Budget:** Even at $10,000, the price is still significantly above my $8,000 budget.
* **Guaranteed Option:** John provides a guaranteed option at my target price. 

It's unlikely Alice will move much further, and risking further negotiation isn't worth exceeding my budget. It's time to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
