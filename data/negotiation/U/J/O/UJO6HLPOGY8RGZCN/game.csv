"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,600,000. This is a fantastic deal, as the product is worth at least that much to you.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be very profitable for you.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision!",1600000.0,Alice,1,
