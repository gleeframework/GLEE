"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,600,000. This is a fantastic deal, as the product is worth at least that much to you.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be very profitable for you.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though Alice is trying to convince him that the product is worth more, Bob knows that it's only worth $1,500,000 to him.  He can get the same product from John for a lower price."
