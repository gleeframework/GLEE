"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to get the product for less than $800,000, and Alice's offer is too high. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $700,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer and a price I'm willing to pay. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and counter again. I'm getting closer to my target price, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $850,000 for the product. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than her last offer.  I'm hoping this is a price she'll find acceptable, as it's closer to my target price and still provides her with a good profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and she hasn't shown much willingness to compromise. I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation, as it might take too much time, and I could end up paying more than I want.  I'm confident that I can secure the product from John for a price I'm happy with."
