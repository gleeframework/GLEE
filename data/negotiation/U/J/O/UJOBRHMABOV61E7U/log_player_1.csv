Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. There's still room to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for less than what the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can push the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value to you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd ideally want more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as what John is offering. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds. 

Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the deal and get my desired value for the product."
