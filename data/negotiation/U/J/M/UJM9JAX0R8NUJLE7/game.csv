"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would that be workable for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer you the product for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
