"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Would you be interested in that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,500. I'll come down to $10,200. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,200 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,800, Bob. I'll come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
