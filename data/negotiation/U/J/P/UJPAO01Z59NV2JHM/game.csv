"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find an agreement with you, $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not able to go that high. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. ",1800000.0,Bob,4,
