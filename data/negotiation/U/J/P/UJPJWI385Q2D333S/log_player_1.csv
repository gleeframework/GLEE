Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your desired amount. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, providing a reason like ""great deal for the value"" might pique Bob's interest and make him less likely to immediately walk away.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects this initial high price, it indicates he's aiming for a price much lower.  We can then gradually decrease our offer in subsequent rounds,  keeping John ($150) as our safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than both our minimum acceptable price ($150) and our initial offer.  Accepting this would be a substantial loss. We know we have John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $60 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider something closer to $180?"" ,
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** We've made a substantial decrease from $200 to $180, showing flexibility. However, we're still well above both Bob's offer and our absolute minimum, aiming to create a sense of concession while still protecting our interests.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the value proposition, but without directly dismissing his perception of the price. 
* **Encouraging Higher Counter:**  By suggesting a price closer to our desired range, we're subtly nudging Bob to increase his offer in the next round.

**Strategy:**

We're playing a balancing act:  conceding enough to keep Bob engaged while holding firm to a price that's profitable. If Bob doesn't budge significantly from $60 in the next round, we'll likely need to decrease our offer again or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer considering its condition and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer slightly, $75 is still far below our minimum acceptable price of $150. It seems unlikely he's willing to jump to a price that would be profitable for us. Continuing negotiations at this pace might not be the most efficient use of our time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't let it go for less than $150. This is already a very competitive price, and I have another interested buyer. Let me know if you're willing to meet this price, as I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're presenting this as our non-negotiable bottom line. By being transparent about our minimum and the other buyer (John), we're increasing the perceived value and urgency. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're subtly introducing a deadline to push Bob towards a decision without issuing an ultimatum.
* **Protecting Our Interests:**  We're no longer negotiating down; it's now up to Bob to either accept this final offer or walk away. This strategy ensures we don't waste more time on lowball offers and safeguards our option to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

This is a decisive move.  If Bob accepts, we achieve our absolute minimum acceptable price. If he rejects this, we move forward with selling to John at $150, avoiding further haggling."
