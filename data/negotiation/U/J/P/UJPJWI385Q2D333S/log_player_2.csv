"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $80 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states my position. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get Alice to counteroffer somewhere between my offer and my actual maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $60 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider something closer to $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair offer considering its condition and the current market."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up but Staying Strategic:** I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm staying well below her counteroffer. 
* **Introducing Justification:**  By mentioning ""condition and the current market,"" I'm giving Alice concrete points to consider and potentially soften her stance.
* **Nearing the Limit:** I'm getting close to my $80 maximum, so the next round will be crucial in deciding whether to settle or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't let it go for less than $150. This is already a very competitive price, and I have another interested buyer. Let me know if you're willing to meet this price, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has revealed her lowest acceptable price ($150), which is far above my budget. She's also introduced a sense of urgency and competition, tactics to try and force my hand.
* **Staying Within Budget is Paramount:** While I could try another counteroffer, it's very risky. I'm better off securing the product at my target price with John. 
* **No Guarantee of Success with Further Negotiation:**  Even if I counteroffer, there's a good chance Alice will reject it or make a minimal concession. It's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
