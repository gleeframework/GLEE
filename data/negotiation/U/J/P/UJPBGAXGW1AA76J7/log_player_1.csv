Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Secure a Deal:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 might make Bob hesitant, thinking he could get it cheaper. A slightly lower price encourages a quicker, more decisive response. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy optimizes the potential for a high-profit sale while ensuring you don't lose out entirely by having John as a backup buyer."
