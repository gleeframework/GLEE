"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Is that something you'd be interested in?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $110. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
