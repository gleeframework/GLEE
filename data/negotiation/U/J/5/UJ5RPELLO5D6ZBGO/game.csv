"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
