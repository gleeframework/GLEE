"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
