Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, but it's still a decent profit. I'll counter, but I'm keeping John in mind.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
