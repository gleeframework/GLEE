"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a starting price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point, but I wanted to give you the first opportunity to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is way above Bob's budget.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, securing the product at his preferred price."
