"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $750,000? This is a fair compromise and will allow us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
