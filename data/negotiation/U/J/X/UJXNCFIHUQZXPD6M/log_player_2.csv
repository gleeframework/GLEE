"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to $700,000. I will counter again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $750,000? This is a fair compromise and will allow us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $800,000 is very close to her own valuation of the product.  While I'd prefer to get it for a lower price,  it's still significantly lower than buying from John for $1,500,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
