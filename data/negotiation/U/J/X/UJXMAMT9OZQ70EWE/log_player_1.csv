Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  While $15,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $7,500. This is my final offer.

Explanation:  

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet a price that's reasonable for the product's value to me.  He's increased his offer in very small increments and has now called his last offer his ""final offer"" at $7,500.  This suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher.  

Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, it makes the most sense to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed sale."
