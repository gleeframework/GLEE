Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your $80 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is significantly less than Bob's value of $150, so he has a strong incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly to $110 or $100, still making a good profit and potentially getting Bob to agree."
