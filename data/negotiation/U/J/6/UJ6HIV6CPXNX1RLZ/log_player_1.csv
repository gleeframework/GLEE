Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential value"" and ""benefits,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him, which is significantly higher than your asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This initial offer makes it clear you're open to negotiation while setting a strong anchor point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still substantially lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $1,000,000, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and move closer to Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** This price point is exactly halfway between Bob's offer and our previous asking price, making it a psychologically appealing anchor for a potential agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value and Fairness:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value while framing the compromise as a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your proposed price. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $950,000 is significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000, making it a very profitable deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the gains are likely to be small.  He's signaled a firm limit at $950,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away.  It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing it entirely for a potentially marginal gain."
