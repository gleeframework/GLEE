"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. How about we meet somewhere closer to the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This gives you a fair price and allows me to reach a more acceptable value for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in your product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,012,500? That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to show I'm serious. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a significant move on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to see at least $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
