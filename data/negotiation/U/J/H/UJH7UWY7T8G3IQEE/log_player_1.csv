Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. How about we meet somewhere closer to the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This gives you a fair price and allows me to reach a more acceptable value for my product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
I reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still determined to get a price closer to $1,000,000. There are still rounds left and I don't want to settle for less, especially since John is offering $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,012,500? That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to show I'm serious. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a significant move on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum target. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to see at least $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
