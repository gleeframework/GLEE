Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  $755,000 is a reasonable price and continuing to negotiate risks her accepting John's offer."
