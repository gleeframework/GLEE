"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $740,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $740,000, which would be $757,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",757500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're so close to a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession. Let's meet at $755,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to call it a day at this number.",755000.0,Alice,7,
