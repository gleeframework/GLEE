"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, ideally under $80.  Alice's initial offer of $175 is way too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's a better price than the initial offer, it's not good enough to accept. Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $115? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $115 is still above Bob's budget. He's aiming for $80 and can get it from John. Therefore, he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $105. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
