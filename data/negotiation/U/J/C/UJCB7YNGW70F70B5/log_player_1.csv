# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is below my bottom line. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $925,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still feel that $850,000 was a fair offer based on my assessment of the product's value. However, I am willing to compromise further. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for above $900,000, and there are several rounds left to try and reach that goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the negotiations so far, I think we're getting closer to a fair price. Let me propose $885,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $900,000. Accepting his offer of $885,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
