"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price given our respective valuations. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm confident you'll see an excellent return on your investment.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably commit to.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a solid compromise that reflects the product's potential and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
