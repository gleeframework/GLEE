I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$6,000 is far too low for me. I need to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price. I hope this is a more appealing price for Bob and will keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum of $15,000. I'll sell to John to ensure I get a fair price."
