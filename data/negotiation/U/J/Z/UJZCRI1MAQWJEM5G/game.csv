,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value goes beyond its market value. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is the best price for the product.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. I'm now offering it to you for $1450000, but this is my final compromise.
