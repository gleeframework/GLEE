{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price than $95. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $102.50. Let's try $98.50. It's closer to what I can afford, and I'm sure this product will be worth it to me too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $98.5 is still a decent profit for me, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product. It's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
