"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $102.50. Let's try $98.50. It's closer to what I can afford, and I'm sure this product will be worth it to me too.",98.5,Bob,4,
