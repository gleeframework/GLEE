"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $10,000 for it. This price reflects both the value it holds for you and allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your response.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges its worth while working for me financially.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain a certain price point for the product. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose a price of $7,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the value provided.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
