# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $10,000 for it. This price reflects both the value it holds for you and allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your response.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain a certain price point for the product. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose a price of $7,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the value provided.
