"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, I'm still not comfortable going lower than $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
