"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's capabilities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise. However, $812,500 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I can offer it for $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you risk her walking away completely in further rounds.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you the product within your budget."
