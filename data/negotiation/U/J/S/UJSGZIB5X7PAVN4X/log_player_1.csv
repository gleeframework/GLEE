"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $10,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,500 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher in the next round.  If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to drop my price to $15,500.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has offered $14,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the odds of him coming up to my price are slim.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee my minimum profit."
