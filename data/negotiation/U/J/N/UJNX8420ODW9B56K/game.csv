"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $875,000. It's a considerable reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
