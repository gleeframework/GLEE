"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $125. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,130.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $130, but I think I can do even better than that. How about $132.50? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get this deal done.",132.5,Alice,5,,
