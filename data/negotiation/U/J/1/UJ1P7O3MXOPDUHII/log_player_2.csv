Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $70, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $75 and $70, and offer you the product for $72.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You have three options:

Alice is very unlikely to go below $72.50.  At this point, it's in your best interest to take the guaranteed offer from John at $80. You'll save money compared to Alice's latest offer."
