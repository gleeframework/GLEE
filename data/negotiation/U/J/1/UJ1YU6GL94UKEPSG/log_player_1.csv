"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly indicates my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in closing a deal or just trying to get the lowest possible price.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push for a better price or use John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's but still significantly lower than my desired $12,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** The ""middle ground"" language emphasizes fairness and helps Bob see the offer as a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The offer remains higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Even at $9,600, I'm still taking a significant hit compared to my minimum desired profit of $12,000.
* **Seeing if Bob is Serious:** Rejecting this offer allows me to test Bob's commitment to buying the product. If he's really interested, he might increase his offer in the next round.
* **John's Safety Net:** The option of selling to John for $12,000 gives me the security to keep rejecting offers that don't meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $9,600 is closer to my desired price, I still need a bit more to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,700?  This price is fair, allows us to both make a good deal, and keeps us moving towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by a small amount ($100) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm again emphasizing a fair deal and the benefits for both of us to make the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  The offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, indicating that I'm not desperate to close the deal and have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose a price of $9650 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum desired profit of $12,000.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** By rejecting, I'm testing Bob's willingness to go higher. If he's serious about buying, he might be willing to increase his offer further.
* **John as the Backup:** With John waiting to pay $12,000, I'm comfortable rejecting offers that don't meet my minimum.  This gives me the leverage to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $9,700, which is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Threatening to Move On:**  I'm subtly threatening to sell to John, adding urgency and making Bob realize he might lose the opportunity.
* **Slight Compromise:** While I'm sticking with $9,700, the message is less about ""meeting in the middle"" and more about highlighting the value of the product and the benefits of closing the deal."
