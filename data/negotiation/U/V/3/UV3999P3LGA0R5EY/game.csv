"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $14,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $12,000 is below my minimum. How about we meet halfway at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
