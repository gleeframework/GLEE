"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I still believe we can find a solution within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This still leaves a bit of room for negotiation while respecting the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
