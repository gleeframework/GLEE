Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too low, and I believe we can reach a better price point in the next rounds.  I want to see if I can get him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. However, I still believe we can find a solution within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This still leaves a bit of room for negotiation while respecting the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my initial asking price.  I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
