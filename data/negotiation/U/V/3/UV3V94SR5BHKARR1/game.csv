"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my limitations and the potential of the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your need for information, but I'm not comfortable sharing my plans for the product at this stage. I'm confident it will be valuable in my hands, but I need to keep those details confidential. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is my absolute limit. It's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
