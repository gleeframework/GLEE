"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $695,000.
