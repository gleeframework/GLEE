"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500,000 at this time."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. There's a good chance Alice will counter, giving us more information to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $1,000,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's room for further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground quickly. It's a significant jump from our previous offer but keeps us below our maximum budget and John's fallback price. This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is signaling that $900,000 is her bottom line. Since you have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000, it's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice. You maximize your savings by going with John."
