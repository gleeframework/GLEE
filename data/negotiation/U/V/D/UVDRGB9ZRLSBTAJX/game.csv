"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500,000 at this time.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
