"Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,600,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,450,000 remains too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This offer takes into account our negotiations and represents my final position.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
