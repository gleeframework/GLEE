"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from the transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $900,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we settle at $825,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  Let's split the difference. How about we close this deal at $862,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we could finalize this transaction quickly.  What do you say?",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really driving a hard bargain! I'm willing to budge a little, but $862,500 is still pushing it.  My final offer is $840,000.  If that works for you, we can wrap this up now. If not, I think I'll have to explore other options.",840000.0,Bob,6,
