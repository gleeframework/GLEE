Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can do even better. How about $900,000 for the product? This price aligns more closely with my valuation and still offers a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
