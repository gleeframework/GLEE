"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $105 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $112? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again - how about $108?  That way we both get a little closer to our target price.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go down to $108 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $115? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  To make a deal, I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider buying from John.",110.0,Bob,6,
