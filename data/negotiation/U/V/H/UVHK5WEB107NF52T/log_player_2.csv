"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as I understand it's worth even more to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
