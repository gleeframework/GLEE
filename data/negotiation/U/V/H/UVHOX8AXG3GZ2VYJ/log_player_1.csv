Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, an investment reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to see its worth beyond his initial assessment. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit."
