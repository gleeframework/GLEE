Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate with Bob. Starting with a higher offer ($20,000) makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Anchoring:** It sets a high initial point for the negotiation, potentially influencing Bob to consider a higher price than he might have otherwise.
* **Maximizing profit:** If Bob accepts, you'll make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:** You can always come down in price if Bob counters, and you'll still likely land above your $15,000 minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. If you need to sell quickly, a lower offer might be more strategic."
