"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Could you consider meeting me at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value. Would you consider $990,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
