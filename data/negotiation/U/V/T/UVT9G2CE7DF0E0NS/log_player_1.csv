Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value. Would you consider $990,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $987,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

Bob is very slowly increasing his offer price, and we are getting close to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the profit."
