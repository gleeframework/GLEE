"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. This is an exclusive deal just for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $12,000 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer means saving $2,500 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of rejecting her offer and ending up paying more to John is not worth it in this scenario."
