{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is still above Bob's maximum value of $120.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Initial counteroffer:** $85 is a reasonable starting point, well below Alice's offer but still above her minimum value.  
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to start a negotiation and see if Alice is willing to budge.  There's still room to negotiate higher if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Previous offer:** Alice offered $95, which is still above Bob's maximum.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $91.50, which is still above Bob's maximum value of $120.
* **Strategy:**  With only one round left, the time pressure is high.  While Alice has come down slightly, it's still not within Bob's budget. The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might not budge further, and Bob would be left with no deal.  It's safer and more cost-effective to buy from John at $120 to ensure he gets the product."
