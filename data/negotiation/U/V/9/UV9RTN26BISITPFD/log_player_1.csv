Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for you.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is. If he flat-out rejects it, you know he's likely very price-sensitive and you're better off with John."
