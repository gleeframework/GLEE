"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving me room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price I'd accept, but there's still room to haggle. I'll try countering again, aiming somewhere between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate that, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to staying above $80.  While I could try to haggle further, $82 is a good price and it's not worth the risk of her backing out or the time for further negotiation."
