This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $115 is a decent compromise. You're saving $5 off John's price.
* **Risk of losing out:** Alice is threatening to sell to John if you don't accept. While it might be a bluff, there's no guarantee she'll offer a better price.

Pushing for $110 might backfire, and you'd end up paying $120 to John anyway."
