Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is still a significant discount from your initial offer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much further from his $975,000 offer. Accepting a lower price now incurs a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
