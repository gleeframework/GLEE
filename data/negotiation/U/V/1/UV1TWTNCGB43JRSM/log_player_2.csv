Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $88.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $88, which is within your budget and closer to your desired price.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While you could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you could end up losing the deal or paying more at John's."
