Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit above my minimum of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum price and a good deal considering he rejected my initial offer. It's better to accept and secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale entirely."
