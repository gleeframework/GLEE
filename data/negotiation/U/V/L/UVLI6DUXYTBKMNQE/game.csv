"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the price yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $10.",105.0,Alice,5,
