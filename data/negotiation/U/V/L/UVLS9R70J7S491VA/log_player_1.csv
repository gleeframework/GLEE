{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter. It also frames the offer as beneficial to him, highlighting the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  I'm very interested in the product, but I need to make sure the price is right. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired price and leaves room for a better deal. You're confident you can negotiate a higher price and want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference at $9,250? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm very eager to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  It's above your minimum price of $8,000 and is closer to your desired price.  While you could continue negotiating,  it's unlikely you'll get a significantly higher offer from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and a good profit."
