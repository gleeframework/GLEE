"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,075,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. How about we try $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,080,000 is getting close, but I have to consider my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $1,095,000?  I'm confident that at this price, this will be a win-win for both of us.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $1,095,000 is still a bit out of reach. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,080,000 and $1,095,000. How about we try $1,087,500? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
