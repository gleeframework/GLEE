"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. While it's worth a great deal more to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant price reduction, considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a significant discount from the product's true value to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the same product from John for a much better price."
