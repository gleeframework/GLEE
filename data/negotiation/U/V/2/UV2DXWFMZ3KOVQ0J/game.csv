"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $125? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $127? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $126. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the pot.",126.0,Alice,7,
