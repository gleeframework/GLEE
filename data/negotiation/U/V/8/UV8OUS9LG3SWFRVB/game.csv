"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great price, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  It's a fair price that's still beneficial for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $80, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me is $120. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $95.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm thinking more along the lines of $98. It's still a great deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
