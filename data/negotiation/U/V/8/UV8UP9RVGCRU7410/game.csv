"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
