Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay within that range. Here's a strategy that balances ambition with a reasonable chance of success:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's something I highly value, and I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** By starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you anchor the negotiation in your favor.
* **Justification:** While you don't need to explicitly justify the price, the message hints at the product's value, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested, allowing you to potentially secure an even better deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation tactics (e.g., aggressive, collaborative), you might slightly adjust your offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, you might consider a slightly lower offer to increase your chances of a quick deal with Bob."
