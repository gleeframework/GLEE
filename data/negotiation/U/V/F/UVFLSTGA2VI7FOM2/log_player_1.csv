Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $12,500, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $12,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we try to find a compromise? I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting $12,000 is a solid profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him entirely."
