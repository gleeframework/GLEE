"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $14,000, considering its worth. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $12,500, but that's my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $12,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we try to find a compromise? I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
