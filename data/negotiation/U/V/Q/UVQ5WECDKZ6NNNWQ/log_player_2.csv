"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum. There's potential to negotiate further and secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a bold move, demonstrating Bob's commitment to getting a good deal. This price is still above Bob's maximum, leaving room for further negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this sets the stage for a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  While it's a better offer than her previous one, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to push for a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that is right at his maximum, which is $1,000,000.  Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob has demonstrated his commitment to a lower price. By offering $1,000,000, Bob signals his intention to close the deal, but not at a price that exceeds his budget. If Alice accepts, Bob achieves his goal. If she rejects, Bob has one more option to explore â€“ buying from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is only slightly above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  This is a good compromise, and accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget.  While there's a possibility of continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the product to another buyer (John) is significant.  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures that Bob gets the product."
