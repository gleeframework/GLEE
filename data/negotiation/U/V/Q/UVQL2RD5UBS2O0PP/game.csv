"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  While $1200000 is not a price I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1700000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows us to come to an agreement. ",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1550000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
