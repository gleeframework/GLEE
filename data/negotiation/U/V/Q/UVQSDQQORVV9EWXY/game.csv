"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept.  Would you consider $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. How about $900,000?  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $875,000, but I'd like to propose a deal where I pay cash upfront and also give you a 2% commission on any future sales of the product. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, that commission offer is interesting, but it adds uncertainty. I'm willing to make this simple: $890,000, and we close the deal today. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to finalize the sale.",890000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product, but this is my absolute final offer.  This price reflects the immense value of the product while recognizing your interest. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to pay $855,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",855000.0,Bob,10,
