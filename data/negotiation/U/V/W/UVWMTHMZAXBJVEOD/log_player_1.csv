Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  I don't want to risk getting stuck at a lower price, so I'm going to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price."
