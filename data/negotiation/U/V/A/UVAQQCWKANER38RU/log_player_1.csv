Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $120 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I need to secure a better price. I will counteroffer and try to close the deal for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $130 would be a more reasonable price for the product. Let me know if this is something we could agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $130 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  There's a chance I might not get a better offer, and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
