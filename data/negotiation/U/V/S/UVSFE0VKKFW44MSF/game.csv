"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm sticking with $125.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $115. Can you consider this offer?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $115 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
