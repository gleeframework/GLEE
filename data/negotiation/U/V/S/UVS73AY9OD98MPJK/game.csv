"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this point. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
