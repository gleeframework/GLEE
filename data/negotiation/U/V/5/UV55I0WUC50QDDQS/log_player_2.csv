# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price to get a deal done."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and represents a significant improvement over her initial offer.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might harden her stance, and you might end up buying from John for a higher price. Accepting this offer provides a reasonable deal without unnecessary risk."
