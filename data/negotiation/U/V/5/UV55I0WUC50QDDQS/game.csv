"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
