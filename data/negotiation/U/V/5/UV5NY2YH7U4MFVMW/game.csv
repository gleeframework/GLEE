"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Can you consider that?,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $110. I've already done some research and found similar products for lower prices. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",105.0,Bob,6,
