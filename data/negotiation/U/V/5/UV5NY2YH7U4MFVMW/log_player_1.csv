"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not at a point where it's worth selling to Bob. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can get a guaranteed $120 from John. I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $110. I've already done some research and found similar products for lower prices. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, it's clear he's not willing to meet me closer to my minimum price.  I've got a guaranteed offer from John that will allow me to make a profit, so I'm going to take it."
