"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If that fails, he can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm still confident the product's value is higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can try to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get a better deal. If that doesn't work out, he can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,180,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, as Alice has stated she's reached her bottom line.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a stalemate."
