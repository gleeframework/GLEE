"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your perspective, I'm not comfortable with $1,150,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal and is closer to the value I'm seeking. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1180000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,180,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,220,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go without sacrificing too much. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,220,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1,180,000. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can agree on that.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
