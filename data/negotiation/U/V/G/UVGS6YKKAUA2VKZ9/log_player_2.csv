"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance he could negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting his counteroffer and potentially ending up paying more isn't worth it."
