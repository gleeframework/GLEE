"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $165. It's a bit higher than your counteroffer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $155.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $160, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price that I think you'll find worth it.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $160 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $158.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",158.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're really close, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. I'm willing to meet you at $162, but I'm not going any lower than that. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",162.0,Alice,7,
