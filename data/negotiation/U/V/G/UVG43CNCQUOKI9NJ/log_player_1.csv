Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation if he wants to counter. It also gives me a chance to see if he's truly interested in buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
I am accepting Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's less than what I would like, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and better than selling to John for $12,000.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
