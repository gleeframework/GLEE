"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1600000. I'm thinking of a price of $1700000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product can bring to your business.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1650000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the value this product brings. I'm thinking of a price of $1650000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure it's a reasonable one. I'm thinking of a price of $1625000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1625000.0,Alice,9,
