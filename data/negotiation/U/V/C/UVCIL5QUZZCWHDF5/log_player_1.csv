{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price reflecting its worth and the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price with John creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps it significantly above his valuation.
* **Confidence and Urgency:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and my confidence in the deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a strong opening offer. I'm willing to negotiate slightly if Bob counters, but I have a strong alternative with John.
* Bob might try to lowball. I need to be prepared to walk away if his offer doesn't come close enough to my desired price range."
