"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for Alice to counter and for you to eventually reach a price closer to your goal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal. 
* **Strategic Number:**  The offer of $1,050,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it's not an insultingly low number. It signals serious interest while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $1,225,000.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to go with the guaranteed lower price.  Further negotiation with Alice has a low chance of saving you a significant amount, and might even make you miss out on John's offer."
