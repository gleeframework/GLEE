"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
