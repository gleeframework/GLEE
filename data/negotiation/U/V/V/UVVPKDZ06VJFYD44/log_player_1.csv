{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$75 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
