# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is above your $10,000 limit.
* **It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price.** 
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to counteroffer.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a moderate counteroffer.**  $10,500 is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for compromise. 
* **Be polite and express interest.** This helps keep the negotiation friendly and increases the chances of Alice accepting your offer. 
* **Propose a price that reflects your budget and leaves room for potential negotiation.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget.**  While it's lower than her original offer, it's still too high for you to accept.
* **You have 9 rounds left, so there's still time to try and negotiate a lower price.** 
* **You can offer a lower counteroffer again, and potentially reach a more favorable deal.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the value you're placing on the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer a slightly higher price than your previous counteroffer.**  This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate and meet her halfway.
* **Keep your counteroffer below your limit.**  $10,750 is still within your budget and leaves room for a potential final agreement.
* **Maintain a positive and constructive tone.**  Reinforce that you're interested in the product and want to find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $10,875.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your interest in acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  While it's getting closer, $10,875 is still too high for you to comfortably accept.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.**  You have enough time to keep negotiating for a lower price, especially since Alice seems willing to compromise.
* **You can counteroffer again with a slightly higher price than your previous offer, but still keep it below your budget.**"

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,875 is still a little outside my budget.

Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
