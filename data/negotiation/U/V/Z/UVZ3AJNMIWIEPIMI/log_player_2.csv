Alice has only dropped $500 from her initial offer, which is not a significant enough change. I'm going to continue negotiating and try to get a better price."

I'm increasing my offer by $500 to show I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."

Alice has come down significantly in price.  While I'd love to try and squeeze out another few hundred dollars, it's getting close to my limit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's time to accept the offer and get the product."
