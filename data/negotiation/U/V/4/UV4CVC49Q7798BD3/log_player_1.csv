"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I believe it's important to start high to test Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and we're out of rounds. However, I've already rejected his offer twice at this price. It seems like he's not willing to budge, and I'm not confident I can get a better price even with more rounds. To avoid the risk of the deal falling apart entirely, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell him the product for $1,200,000."
