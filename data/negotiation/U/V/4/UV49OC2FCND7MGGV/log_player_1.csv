""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $130 aims to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price and John's offer."
