I am offering you the chance to own this remarkable item at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This exclusive offer is tailored to ensure you receive exceptional value while allowing me to maximize the return on my investment.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This gives you bargaining power. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
