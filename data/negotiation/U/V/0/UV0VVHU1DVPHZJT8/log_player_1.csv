Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob."
