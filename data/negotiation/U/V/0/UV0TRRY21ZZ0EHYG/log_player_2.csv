Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $950,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and at $950,000 I'm getting a good discount compared to John's offer."
