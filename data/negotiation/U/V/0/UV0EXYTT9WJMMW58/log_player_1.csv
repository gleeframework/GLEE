Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $97.5 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $97.50 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference again?  $101.25?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $100.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, $100.5 is significantly better than the $100 I would get from John, and we are now at the halfway point of our negotiations.  It's a good deal for both of us."
