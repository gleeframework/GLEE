I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to the maximum value Bob is willing to pay as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering with $140. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to consider."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer and $15 more than John's offer. I'll take it."
