"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to a price.  There's a significant difference between $900,000 and $1,500,000, so a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and shows Bob is willing to walk away if he doesn't get a good enough price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest price. It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, but still leaves room for Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob could continue to negotiate, the price is now within a reasonable range, and it's getting closer to what he's willing to pay. Accepting Alice's offer avoids further back and forth and secures a product at a price significantly lower than John's."
