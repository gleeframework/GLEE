Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This is to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his valuation of $80, especially since he might not be sure if he can get a better deal elsewhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price to $95. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While I'm still hoping to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $85 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to accept the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob."
