"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
The product is worth $100 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $110.  This is clearly a bad deal for Bob, as he values the product at $80.  It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Bob should offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is $80.  This is the price he can get from John, so it makes sense to start there and see if Alice is willing to negotiate down to that point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $95 is better than her previous offer of $110, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob values the product at $80, and he can buy it from John for that price.  It makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob should offer $85. This is a compromise between his desired price of $80 and Alice's current offer of $95. It shows that he is willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal."
