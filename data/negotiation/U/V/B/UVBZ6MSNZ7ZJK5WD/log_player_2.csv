"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $10,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still leaves you a good deal at $4,000 under your estimated value.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $4,000 below his estimated value.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and him having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.  Accepting the offer is the most rational choice in this situation."
