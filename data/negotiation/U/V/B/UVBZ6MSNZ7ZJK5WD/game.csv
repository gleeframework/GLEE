"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $10,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still leaves you a good deal at $4,000 under your estimated value.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
