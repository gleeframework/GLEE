Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Since Bob values the product at $800,000, offering him the product for that price ensures he will accept the offer. This maximizes my earnings as I can't get more for the product than its value to him. Selling to John for $800,000 would be the same outcome, so offering Bob the same price ensures a guaranteed sale with no risk."
