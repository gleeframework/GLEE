"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great chance for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $875,000**. This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price.
* **Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a good price**.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice for Bob."
