"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $13,000? That would work much better for my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I know we're getting close. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,250? That would seal the deal for me.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer it to you for $13,450. This is my final compromise.",13450.0,Alice,7,
