"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
