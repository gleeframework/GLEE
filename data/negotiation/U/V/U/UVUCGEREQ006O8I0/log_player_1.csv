I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives Bob a good opportunity to negotiate, but it's still a decent profit for me. I'm confident that I can get at least $10,000 for the product, either from Bob or from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum price, I'm hoping I can squeeze a bit more out of him. I'll see if I can make a counteroffer that he'll find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this is attractive enough for him to accept, but it still gives me a profit that I'm happy with."
