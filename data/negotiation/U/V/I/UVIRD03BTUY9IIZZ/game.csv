"Alice, I appreciate the opportunity, but $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for the product, given its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1600000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a more realistic starting point for us both. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000, but that's still a little higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1500000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing the product from John for that price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
