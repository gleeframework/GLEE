,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $1,250,000 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to go down to $1,280,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in closing this deal at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,220,000 is still below what I need, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,250,000 as a final compromise.  Let's seal this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000, which is the lowest I can go. Please consider this as a final offer.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
