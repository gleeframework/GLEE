"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000. This seems like a fair price given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is the best price I can offer at this time, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This price reflects the value to me while allowing you to make a fair profit.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,325,000 is a more comfortable price for you, but I'm still not sure if I can meet you at that number. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
