Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the $800,000 backup offer from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and tailoring the message to Bob's ""expertise"" adds perceived value, making the higher price more palatable.

This approach balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale, aiming for the best possible outcome for Alice."
