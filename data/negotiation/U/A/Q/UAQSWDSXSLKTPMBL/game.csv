"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $13,500. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I see you're serious about the product.  While $13,500 is closer, I can't accept anything less than $16,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true value.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Bob,6,
