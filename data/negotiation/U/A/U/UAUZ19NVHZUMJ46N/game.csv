"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make this investment. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
