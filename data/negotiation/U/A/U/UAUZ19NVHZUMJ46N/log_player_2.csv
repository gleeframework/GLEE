"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly more than his budget of $800,000. He has room to negotiate and should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. He has room to negotiate further and should try to push for a lower price.  There's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make this investment. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he's unlikely to be able to get a better deal from her.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget."
