Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a touch of desirability.
* **Value Emphasis:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of the ""unique value and potential,"" justifying the high price.
* **Fairness:**  The phrase ""fair deal"" aims to frame the price reasonably, even though it's closer to Bob's maximum.
* **Profit Maximization:** This offer allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust slightly downward, but hold firm closer to $1,300,000. Remember, you have John's offer as a safety net."
