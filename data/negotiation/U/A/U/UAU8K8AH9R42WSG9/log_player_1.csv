Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the offer as exclusive. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't miss out on a sale by pricing yourself out of his range completely."
