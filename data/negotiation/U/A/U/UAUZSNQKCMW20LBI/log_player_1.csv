Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we want to aim higher initially. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,200,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than his perceived value but lower than John's offer.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  Offering it for $1,500,000 (what John will pay) is unlikely to be accepted by Bob. We need to find a balance between maximizing profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
