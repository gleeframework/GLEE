"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get a better price. While $1,200,000 is lower than what John is selling for, Bob has room to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to get a good deal. He offers $1,050,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but higher than her desired price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  At $1,150,000, Bob is still getting a good deal and saving $350,000 compared to buying from John."
