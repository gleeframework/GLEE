"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $120. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, as this product is truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $75?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is still below my minimum for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $85, as a final offer before considering other options. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $85 is slightly above your ideal price, it's getting close to your maximum budget and significantly lower than her previous offers.  

Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better outcome.  Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer"" which could mean she's ready to walk away. You risk pushing her too far and losing the opportunity for any discount."
