Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Targeting Bob's perceived value:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being substantially higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Exclusive opportunity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $1,500,000 (John's offer)."
