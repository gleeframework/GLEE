"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $800,000 is still quite high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price.",725000.0,Alice,5,
