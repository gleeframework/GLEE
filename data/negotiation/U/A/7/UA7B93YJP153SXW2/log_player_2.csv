"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is still quite high, considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation. You have 10 rounds, so it's worth exploring lower offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $800,000 is still quite high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer drops the price significantly, showing your serious intent to negotiate. It's a bold move, but it might incentivize Alice to come down further or at least start a more serious discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for further negotiation.  $750,000 is still above your desired price point.  Since you have several rounds left, continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're continuing to negotiate, but now the counteroffers are getting closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer is a small jump from your previous offer, showing Alice you're serious about finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is closer to your desired price point.  You have reached a point where continuing to negotiate may not yield much further savings.  It's a good deal for you, and you've still managed to save $275,000 compared to buying from John."
