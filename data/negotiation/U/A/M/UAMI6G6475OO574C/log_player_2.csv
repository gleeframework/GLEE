"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is higher than your maximum budget of $120. 
* You know you can get the product for $120 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with buying from John."
