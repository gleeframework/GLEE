The offer is still below Alice's latest offer, but it's a significant jump from the previous round, suggesting that Bob may be nearing his limit.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical moment for Bob. Alice's offer of $14,000 is getting very close to the price Bob would pay from John.  There's only one round left, and the chance of getting a lower price from Alice is slim.  Furthermore, Bob is nearing his limit in terms of how much he's willing to pay.  Choosing to buy from John now ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's within his budget, minimizing the risk of further negotiations and potential loss of time and opportunity."
