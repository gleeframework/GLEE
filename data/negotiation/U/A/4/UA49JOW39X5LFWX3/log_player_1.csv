Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth $200. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
