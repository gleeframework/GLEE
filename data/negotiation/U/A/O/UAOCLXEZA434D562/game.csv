"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about $920,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $920,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $940,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your decision.",940000.0,Alice,5,
