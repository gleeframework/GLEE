"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be able to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, as it's below what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000, which is a good price for Bob.** It's below what the product is worth to him ($12,000) and gives him a significant discount compared to John's price. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk.**  Alice might not be willing to go lower, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out altogether.**"
