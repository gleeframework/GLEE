"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $15,000. This is my final compromise on the price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $15,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,000? I'm willing to go a little higher, but that's my absolute maximum.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $13,500. If you're open to this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm going to make one last offer. If you accept $13,000, we can close the deal. However, if you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to go with another option. ",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $13,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer: $14,250. This is my absolute final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",14250.0,Alice,9,
