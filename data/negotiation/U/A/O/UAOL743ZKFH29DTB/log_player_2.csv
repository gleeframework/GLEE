"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can save at least $100,000 by negotiating with Alice.  There's a good chance he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $125,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it."
