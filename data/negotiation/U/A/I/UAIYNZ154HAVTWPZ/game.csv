"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  This still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us!",9500.0,Alice,3,
