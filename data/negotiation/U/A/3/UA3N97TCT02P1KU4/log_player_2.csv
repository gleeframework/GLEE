Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, the product is valued at $1,500,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it at an exclusive price of $1,400,000. This offer is designed to ensure you receive unparalleled value while allowing us to maximize the return on our investment. Please let me know if you require any further information or if you wish to proceed with this exciting opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I know my upper limit is $1,500,000. Her offer of $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **John provides a fallback:**  I know I can get the product for $1,500,000 from John if needed. This gives me leverage to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, I can signal that I'm looking for a better price and potentially get her closer to her own product valuation of $1,200,000."
