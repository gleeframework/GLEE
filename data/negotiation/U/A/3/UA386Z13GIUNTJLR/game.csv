"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still reflects the value this product brings.  Let's work together to find a solution.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $800,000? This would allow us to move forward while respecting both our financial considerations.",800000.0,Bob,4,
