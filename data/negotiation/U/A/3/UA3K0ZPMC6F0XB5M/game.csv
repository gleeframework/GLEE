"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,500. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $14,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement.  $13,750 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,250.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll be selling to John.",14250.0,Alice,7,
