Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is the final concession I'm willing to make, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, the price is $980,000, which is a good deal for Bob, given his maximum budget. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a higher price.  It's better to secure the deal at a good price than to risk losing out altogether or having to pay the full $1,200,000 to John."
