"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product can bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $1000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1000000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and dedicated support for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
