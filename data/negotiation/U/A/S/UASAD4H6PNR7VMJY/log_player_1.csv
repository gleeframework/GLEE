"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm raising the price to $950,000. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's below his valuation and a significant increase from his initial offer. This counteroffer will hopefully be accepted by Bob, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and counteroffer in the next round.  I believe I can get closer to $900,000 which is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. Bob's counteroffer was getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but this is still a good deal for him, considering it's below his valuation. I'm hoping he accepts this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Although I would prefer a higher price, I am running out of time, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price.  I will accept this offer."
