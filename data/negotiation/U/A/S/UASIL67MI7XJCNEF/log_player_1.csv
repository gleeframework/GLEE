Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you leverage.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $925,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a gain ($75,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net and ensures you won't go below your minimum.
* **One-Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept quickly without trying to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a risk Bob might counter-offer or reject the proposal. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate based on your assessment of Bob's personality and your own risk tolerance."
