"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88?  It's a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $90. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $89? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",89.0,Alice,5,
