# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the product's value more than justifies the cost.  Let me know your thoughts and we can discuss the details further.
