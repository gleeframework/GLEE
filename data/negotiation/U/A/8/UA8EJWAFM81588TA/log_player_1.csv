Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth more than Bob might initially think.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important:** While John offers a safety net, aiming slightly higher with Bob could result in a more profitable outcome."
