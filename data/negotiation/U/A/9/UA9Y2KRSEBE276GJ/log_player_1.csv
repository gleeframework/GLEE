{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,300,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This price would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction efficiently. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,250,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm running out of time. It's not ideal, but selling to John is better than risking further negotiation and ending up with an even lower price."
