Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant concession, and I truly believe it represents a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer.  However, $1,112,500 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm confident that the product is worth the value I'm offering, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  Let's settle on $1,118,750. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.
