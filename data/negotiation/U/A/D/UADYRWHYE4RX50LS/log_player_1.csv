{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to:

* **Start high but be realistic:**  $1,150,000 is a significant price, but it's lower than my minimum, so I have room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  My message highlights the product's value to Bob, which is a key negotiation point.
* **Be prepared to counter:** I'm ready to counter Bob's offers if necessary, but my goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Have a Plan B:** If the negotiation doesn't go well, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my starting point, I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum just yet.

* **Time Efficiency:** Selling to John avoids further negotiation and potential deadlocks.
* **No Risk:**  There's no risk of Bob rejecting my offer again and delaying the sale further."
