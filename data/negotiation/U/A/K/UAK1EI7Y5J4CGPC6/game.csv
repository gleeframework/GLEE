"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline the $1,125,000 offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
