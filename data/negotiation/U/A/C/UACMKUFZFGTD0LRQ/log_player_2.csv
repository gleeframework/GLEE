"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially save more by making a counteroffer.  There's room to negotiate since Alice values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still above her value for the product.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for further compromise if Alice isn't happy with the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,250, which is a significant move from her previous offer.  This price is within your budget and still leaves you a good deal compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer allows you to purchase the product for a price you're comfortable with, while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases."
