Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still well within my desired range. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product higher than $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is too low for me.  It's only $500 more than what I can get from John.  Since there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
