"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet at $2,000,000? This offer reflects the product's exceptional value while recognizing your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our interests.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
