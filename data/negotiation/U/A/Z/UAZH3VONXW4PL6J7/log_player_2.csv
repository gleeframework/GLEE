Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet at $2,000,000? This offer reflects the product's exceptional value while recognizing your interest.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is lower than the previous offer, it is still above my limit. I will reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
