"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $850,000? Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value this product offers.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still allow me to cover my costs, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
