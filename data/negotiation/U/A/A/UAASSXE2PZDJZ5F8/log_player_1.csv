"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price that's close to the middle of our estimated values. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also demonstrates the product's worth.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and professional tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's potential benefits to Bob can make him more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $850,000? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **I have leverage:**  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and John is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome, increasing my chances of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value this product offers.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still allow me to cover my costs, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial proposal. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Show flexibility:**  The phrase ""find a price that works for both of us"" shows that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise, falling within my acceptable range. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We're only on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Secure profit:**  $900,000 is significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring a profitable sale."
