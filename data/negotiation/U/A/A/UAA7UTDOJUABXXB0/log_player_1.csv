"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to secure a good price while also leaving the option of selling to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm dropping my price a bit to $1,200,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob while still staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and see if he'll budge a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,100,000, hoping to find a middle ground while still making a profit. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still very low, and I'm running out of time.  It's not worth risking losing the deal completely. I'll sell to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale."
