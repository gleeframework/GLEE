Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiating, which might make Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to him now than risk a long negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price."
