Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price below what it's worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering it at $10,000 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and your guaranteed sale price. This is a common negotiation tactic and aims for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as a special opportunity for Bob."
