"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. What do you think about a price of $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John for $100, which is still within your budget. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to wait and see if Alice lowers her price or if you can find a better deal elsewhere."
