"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer still represents significant value for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering.",14000.0,Bob,4,
