"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for my product. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
