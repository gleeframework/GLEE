Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 
* **Strategic Communication:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making the offer more appealing."
