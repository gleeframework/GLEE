# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($11,500) is higher than your maximum price ($10,000). 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.
