"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $130, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

You can still try to get a better price from Alice. $125 is better than $150, but you can likely get it for closer to $120."
