{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a good deal while still maximizing your profit. He saves $10 compared to his valuation, and you make a significant profit over both your minimum and John's offer."
