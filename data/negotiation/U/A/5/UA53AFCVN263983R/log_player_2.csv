"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really worthwhile and I'm hoping to get $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $90, but I can't go any higher.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
