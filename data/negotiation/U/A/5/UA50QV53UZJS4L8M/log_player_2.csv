"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still potential for negotiation, especially since Bob can buy from John for $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
