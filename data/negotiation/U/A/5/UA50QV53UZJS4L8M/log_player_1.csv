"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  The initial offer is close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), aiming to immediately capture his attention.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that this is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good one, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. Accepting John's offer at this stage would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between the initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,300,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The language emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" reinforcing the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product, and his offer of $1,350,000 is a strong one. While we could try to push for a little more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might lose interest or the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and represents a successful outcome for both parties."
