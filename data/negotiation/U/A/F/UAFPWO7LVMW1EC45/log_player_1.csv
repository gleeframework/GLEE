Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $13,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I'm going to risk it and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,250,  which is a significant compromise from my initial price. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already at round 6. It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
