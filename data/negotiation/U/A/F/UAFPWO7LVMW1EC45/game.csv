,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,250,  which is a significant compromise from my initial price. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiations.",13250.0,Alice,5,
