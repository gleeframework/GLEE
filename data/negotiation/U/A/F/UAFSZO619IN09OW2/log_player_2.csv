"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, there's still room to push for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is still a great price for you, and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $850,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get the price down further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
