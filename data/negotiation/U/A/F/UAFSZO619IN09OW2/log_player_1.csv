"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is still a great price for you, and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to push for a higher price, $900,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired profit.  There's a risk of going back and forth with Bob and ending up with a lower price, or having to sell to John for $800,000.  It's time to close the deal."
