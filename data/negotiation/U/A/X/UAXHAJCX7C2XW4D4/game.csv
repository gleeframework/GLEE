"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This price is still very fair given the value it holds for me. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to part with it for.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also acknowledging the need for you to make a profit. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. My next counteroffer is $1180000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1180000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1120000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I truly believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",1120000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1120000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we may not be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $1165000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1165000.0,Alice,7,
