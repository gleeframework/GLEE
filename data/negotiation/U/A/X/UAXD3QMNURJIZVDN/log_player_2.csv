"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're aiming to save as much as possible, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a lower price than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

You're starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant reduction from her initial price, but still within the range you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is a better deal than John's $120, you're still aiming to save more. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice you're serious about buying but still wanting a lower price.  This counteroffer is a good compromise between your desired price and Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $82, which is a good deal compared to John's $120.  At this point, the negotiations are getting close to your maximum price, and it's likely you won't get a significantly better offer from Alice in the remaining rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
