"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850000. This price reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I believe this is a good compromise and would like to hear your thoughts.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $875000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to offer $860000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this gap.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $880000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
