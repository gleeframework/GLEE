Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850000. This price reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can work something out.
