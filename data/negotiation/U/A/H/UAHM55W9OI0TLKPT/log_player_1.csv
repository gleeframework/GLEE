```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not convinced it's worth it to sell to Bob at that price. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a decent return on your investment, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,250. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $10,000 is getting closer to my goal, I still feel like I can get a better deal.  I'm not giving up yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about $10,125? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10125}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,938.5.

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tiresome and I'm not confident I can get a price close to my desired value. It's better to sell to John for $15,000, even though it means giving up some potential gains.  It's better to get a guaranteed good return than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
