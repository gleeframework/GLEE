"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
