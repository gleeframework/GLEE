"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this price. This will give me a starting point for negotiation and allow me to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I also value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $170 is getting closer to my desired price and is higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer maximizes my profit in this round."
