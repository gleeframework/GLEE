Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant amount for Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately making me appear inflexible.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware this is a simple AI model. In a real negotiation, I would factor in many more variables: Bob's negotiating style, my time constraints, and the risk of losing a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Risk of losing to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob if I'm patient and strategic. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my offer slightly, I demonstrate willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value:**  $950,000 is still a significant profit for Bob, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""let's make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer is a calculated risk. I'm betting that Bob is motivated to close the deal and will be willing to pay a bit more. However, if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move forward with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalemated:**  Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed deal with John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John eliminates the uncertainty and risk associated with further negotiation.

**Important Note:**

This decision is a pragmatic one based on maximizing my potential earnings while minimizing risk. I believe that selling to John now is the best course of action, considering the current state of the negotiations and my commitment to achieving my minimum price."
