"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $100. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
