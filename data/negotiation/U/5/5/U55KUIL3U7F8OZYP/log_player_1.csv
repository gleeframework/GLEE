Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and also shows Bob that I value the product.  I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob's offer, while also showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than what John is willing to pay. It's not a huge difference, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing both buyers.  It's better to secure the sale now for a decent price."
