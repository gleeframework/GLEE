"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for a profit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $200 and Bob's offer of $120. I believe this price is fair and could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $150.  It's better to secure a sale at $140 than risk getting nothing."
