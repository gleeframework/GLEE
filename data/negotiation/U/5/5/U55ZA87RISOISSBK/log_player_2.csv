"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $120, and she's offering it for $110. While this is less than John's price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You can get a better deal from John.** Although John's price is your limit, you're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John if you absolutely need the product."
