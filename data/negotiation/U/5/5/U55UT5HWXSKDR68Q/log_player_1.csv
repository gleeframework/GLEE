{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum ($12,000), but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point as it's slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while also ensuring I'm not giving away too much value from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $10,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counter-offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm definitely interested in this product.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, though. Would you consider $10,750? That's a good compromise and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,750 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a deal, but it's risky. John is a sure thing, offering my minimum. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
