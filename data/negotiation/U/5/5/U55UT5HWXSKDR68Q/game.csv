"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $10,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm definitely interested in this product.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, though. Would you consider $10,750? That's a good compromise and I think we can both be happy with that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
