Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob is only offering that amount. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 as a compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,187,500?  It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1187500}

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so let's see if we can find common ground with Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob.  He's not willing to go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. I've already compromised significantly, and with only two rounds left, I don't want to risk getting a lower offer. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale, and while it's not my ideal price, it's the best option available at this point."
