"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 as a compromise. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1125000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1187500?  It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
