"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This still gives you a significant saving compared to your initial estimate, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm trying to save as much as I can, but I also want to make sure I'm not being too aggressive and risking a deal falling through.",825000.0,Bob,4,
