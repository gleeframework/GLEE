Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob.
* **It's not too aggressive:** You're leaving some room for Bob to negotiate, which could potentially lead to a faster and smoother transaction. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response.  If he rejects the offer, you can either counter-offer or decide to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for you. Therefore, rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round is the most beneficial option. 

In the next round, you can counter-offer with a price closer to your desired range, aiming to bridge the gap between your expectations and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This still gives you a significant saving compared to your initial estimate, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but still protecting your minimum price.
* **It's a compromise:** The price is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's, showing you're open to a middle ground.
* **Positive messaging:** The message highlights the benefit to Bob and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties. 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping you in a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm trying to save as much as I can, but I also want to make sure I'm not being too aggressive and risking a deal falling through. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's still slightly lower than your preferred price, it's a reasonable compromise and ensures a successful transaction.  

Selling to John for $800,000 would be a lower return, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk him walking away entirely.  

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to maximize your earnings while securing a sale quickly."
