,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can do.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm a serious buyer and ready to close the deal today if the price is right.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
