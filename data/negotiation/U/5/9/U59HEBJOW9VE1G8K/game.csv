"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a tremendous asset to you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working within a budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budgetary constraints. However, the offer of $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic number.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering its value and my financial limits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. It seems we're getting closer. I've taken another look at my own calculations, and while this product is truly exceptional, I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle on $1,650,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To be frank, I'm only willing to go as high as $1,200,000. If that's not workable for you, I understand, but I believe it's a very fair offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
