"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $680,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this price.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm confident that this price will satisfy both of us and allow us to close the deal.",700000.0,Alice,5,
