"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which I believe reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is closer to your desired price point, you still have room to negotiate.  You're aiming for a price closer to $650,000, and with several rounds left, rejecting the offer allows you to continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $680,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 680000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm confident that this price will satisfy both of us and allow us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good compromise.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with continued negotiation, it's likely that further rounds would only yield a minimal reduction.  The risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer or reaching a stalemate increases with each round. Additionally, you have 5 rounds left, giving Alice plenty of time to harden her position. It's in your best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
