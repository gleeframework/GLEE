"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your endeavors. I understand the value of this product might vary based on your individual needs and perspective. To be transparent, this product holds a value of no less than $1500000 to me. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I'm confident that this product will provide you with substantial returns, exceeding the asking price. If this offer isn't appealing, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1500000. So, consider this a chance to secure something potentially very valuable at a price that offers significant upside. What do you say?
