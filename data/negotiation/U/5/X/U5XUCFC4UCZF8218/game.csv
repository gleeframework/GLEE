"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is a significant sum, this product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll be receiving.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
