"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and it allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a discount from her perspective, it's not a good enough deal for you.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $975,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is closer to your desired price point. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  $937,500 is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $937,500 is still above my budget of $800,000.  It's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Given that John is willing to sell me the product for my maximum budget, I will choose to buy from John instead."
