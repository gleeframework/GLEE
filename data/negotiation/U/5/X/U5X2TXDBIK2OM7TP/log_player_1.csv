Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures I make a significant profit.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While I have a backup buyer, selling to Bob at this price guarantees a higher profit than my alternative ($100 from John)."
