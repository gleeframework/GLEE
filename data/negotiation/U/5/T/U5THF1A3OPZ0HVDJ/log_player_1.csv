Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing you a better deal than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could:

* **Go even higher:**  Push closer to $1,200,000 if you're feeling bold.
* **Start lower:**  Aim for a faster sale, knowing you have John's offer as a safety net. 

The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and how much you want to push for the highest possible profit."
