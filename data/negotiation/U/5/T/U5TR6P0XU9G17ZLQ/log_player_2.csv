"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects its worth to me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's potential. However, $800,000 undervalues its true capabilities and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and unlocks significant value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I'm going to continue to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This price reflects a balanced compromise, allowing me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value."", ""product_price"": 900000}
