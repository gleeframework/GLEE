Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $8,000 is too low.  I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're working within a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,250 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm going to try to get a little closer to my target in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay closer to $9,000. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear we're not going to be able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal."
