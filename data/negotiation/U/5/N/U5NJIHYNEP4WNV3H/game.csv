,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're working within a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay closer to $9,000. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at that price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
