Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll recognize its immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,900,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** By starting with a very high price ($1,900,000), I'm setting a strong anchor. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it makes the following scenarios seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counter, and I can appear flexible while still aiming for a price well above my minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This knowledge gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to confidently aim high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Negotiating prices involves understanding the psychology of the buyer and adapting to their responses."
