Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $850,000 is too low.  How about $950,000? This is a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $900,000 is a good deal and I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating, I might risk losing the sale entirely and having to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
