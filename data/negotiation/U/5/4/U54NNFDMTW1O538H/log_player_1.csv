"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  I think this is a fair starting point for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a price closer to our minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation but ensuring we don't sell ourselves short. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" we aim to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a premium level.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""fair starting point"" signals our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have room to negotiate and can leverage our ability to sell to John for our minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but stand firm on the product's value, avoiding a drastic price drop. 
* **Compromise:** We move down slightly to $1,400,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the ""true value"" to reinforce the product's worth and justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,380,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $1,380,000 is still too low, and we have the leverage of John's offer.  We'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1390000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We make a smaller concession this round ($10,000) to signal we're nearing our limit but are still open to negotiation.
* **""Competitive Offer"" Framing:**  We emphasize the attractiveness of our offer relative to the product's value.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By stating we're ""serious about closing the deal,"" we subtly introduce a sense of time sensitivity without resorting to hardball tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $1,390,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,370,000? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is not increasing significantly, and he's still substantially below our minimum. His willingness to make concessions has decreased (""one more concession"").  At this point, we risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with diminishing returns. Selling to John for our guaranteed $1,500,000 makes the most sense, avoiding further risk and potentially wasted time."
