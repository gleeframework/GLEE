"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've stated.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a significant deviation from its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still above my comfort zone.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
