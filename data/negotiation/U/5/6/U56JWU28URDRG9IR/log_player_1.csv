Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, we want to see if we can get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly if needed. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it's worth a shot to see if he's willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
