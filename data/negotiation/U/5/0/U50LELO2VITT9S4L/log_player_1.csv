Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  A positive tone might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $170 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, and still earn more than my minimum.
* **Selling to John:** I keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only able to pay up to $120 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, I can still negotiate with him.  I believe there's a chance to get a price closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:** I have John's offer as a backup. If negotiation with Bob falls apart, I can still secure a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $170, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  Highlighting that $140 is a ""good deal for both of us"" emphasizes fairness and helps build common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still not able to go above $130 for the product. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price reductions, potentially ending up with a deal below my minimum.
* **John provides a secure deal:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum profit, which is significantly better than the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

It's better to take the safe and secure option with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
