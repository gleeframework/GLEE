"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a great opportunity for Bob, encouraging him to consider it seriously.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear that I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though I have 10 rounds, I don't want to waste time on an offer that's so far below my expectations.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,000,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his original counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of a good deal for both sides.
* **Open to negotiation:** Again, I encourage Bob to respond, keeping the conversation open."
