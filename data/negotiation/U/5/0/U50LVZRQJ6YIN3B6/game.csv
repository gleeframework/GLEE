,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $125?  That's a good price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $127.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
