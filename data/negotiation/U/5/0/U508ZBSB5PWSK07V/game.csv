"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still gives me some room to work with, but it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet you at $1,150,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between the value of the product to me and the cost to you.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
