Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,200 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,100. I think this is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,100.  At this point, accepting her offer would mean overpaying. Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John."
