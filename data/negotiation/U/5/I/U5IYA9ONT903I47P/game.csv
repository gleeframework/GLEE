"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8875?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8875.0,Bob,4,
