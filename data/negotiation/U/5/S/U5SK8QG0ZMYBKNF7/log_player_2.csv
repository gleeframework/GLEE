"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $1000000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant decrease from her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and Bob should aim to secure the product within his budget."
