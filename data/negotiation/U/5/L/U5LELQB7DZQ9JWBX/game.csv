"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, however $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  Could you do $13,000? This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value the product holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be at $11,250. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a great deal for both of us and allow me to comfortably purchase the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
