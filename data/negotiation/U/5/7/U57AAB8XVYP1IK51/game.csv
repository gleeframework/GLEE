"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $850000 is the best price for me.
