"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $110.  I still have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $100. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident I can get closer to my $110 target in the next few rounds.  Plus, I have the backup option of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $108.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $108. Would you be willing to meet me at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still a bit disappointed that I couldn't get closer to $110,  $106 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the deal to Bob completely.  I also have the backup option of selling to John for $120, so I'm not feeling too pressured to get a higher price."
