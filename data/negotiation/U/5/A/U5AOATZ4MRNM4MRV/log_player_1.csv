{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both parties. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the value I know you see in this product, while still giving me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you understanding the value of the product. However, $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I want to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,400,000 is unfortunately not enough for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's try $1,600,000. This is still a good value for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
