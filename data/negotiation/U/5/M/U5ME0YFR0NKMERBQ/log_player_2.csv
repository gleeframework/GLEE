"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your eagerness to sell, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product and its potential benefits, I'd be willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down to $925,000 or closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to accept $925,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer $920,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $925,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and we might end up stuck with a deal closer to $950,000.  Accepting her offer secures a good price that's well within my budget."
