{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  How about $10,750? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 5

# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,100. This is my final compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

Alice is being stubborn, and the price is still too high. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $12,000. You're still within your budget, and you don't want to risk getting stuck with a price you're not comfortable with."
