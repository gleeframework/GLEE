"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also shows that I value the product highly and am not afraid to ask for what I believe it's worth.  I'll keep in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial value.  I'll keep an eye on John's offer, but I'm hoping to secure a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a higher price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction, but it's still above John's offer, and I'm hoping Bob sees this as a good compromise.  I'm running out of rounds, and I need to make a decision soon on whether to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough, and I'm running out of time.  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, John's offer is a guaranteed sale that's better than risking a last-minute negotiation breakdown with Bob."
