"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 still isn't workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
