Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about $101.50?

You have three options:

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $101.50. Accepting this offer gets you a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of her increasing the price or the negotiation falling through."
