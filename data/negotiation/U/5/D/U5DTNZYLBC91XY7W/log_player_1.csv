Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
