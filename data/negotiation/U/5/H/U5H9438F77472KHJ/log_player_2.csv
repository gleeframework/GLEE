"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to him, and Alice's offer is higher than that. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay from John. There's room to negotiate further, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is still lower than Alice's offer, but it shows that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget.  He's getting closer to John's price, but it's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down a little more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. 

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.  At this point, John offers a better price and the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and getting a worse deal isn't worth it."
