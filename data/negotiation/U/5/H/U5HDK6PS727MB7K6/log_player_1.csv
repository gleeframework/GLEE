Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" compared to my other offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
