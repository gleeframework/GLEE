"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below what it's worth to me and a good price for you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
