{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below what it's worth to me and a good price for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's a clear and friendly offer:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response and your desire to reach a deal quickly versus maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that low.  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate. 
* **Time investment:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming.
* **John's offer:**  While John is offering a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then finding out John is no longer interested.

I'll take the $10,750 as it's a reasonable outcome, and I can move on to other opportunities."
