Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a lower price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to accept. $1,080,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I think I can still negotiate a better price, and I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm also not going to buy from John yet, as I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,090,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting a bit tight. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and while her offer of $1,090,000 is still a bit higher than my desired price, it's closer than my previous counteroffer. There's a risk of Alice becoming even more stubborn or rejecting my next counteroffer. Additionally, buying from John at $1,500,000 is considerably more expensive.  It's best to accept the offer and finalize the deal, securing a decent price for the product."
