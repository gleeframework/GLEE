Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $800,000 (our guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to leave Bob with some perceived value (surplus) to incentivize him to buy. Offering it for $925,000 gives Bob a potential surplus of $75,000 while netting us a $125,000 profit over our minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Sale:** The price is attractive enough to Bob while still very profitable for us.
2. **Avoid Leaving Money on the Table:**  We don't want to offer it too low and miss out on potential profit."
