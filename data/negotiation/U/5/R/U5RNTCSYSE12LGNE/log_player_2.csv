"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your personal value limit of $1,000,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate with John or potentially find another seller."
