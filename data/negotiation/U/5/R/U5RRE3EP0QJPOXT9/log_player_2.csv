"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get the product for a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he might be able to get it down further, Alice is now closer to his ideal price point. It's not worth risking a further rejection, which would push him closer to John's price, which is higher than Bob's desired amount."
