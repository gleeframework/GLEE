"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
