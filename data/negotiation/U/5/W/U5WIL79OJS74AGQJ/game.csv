"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can do $1800000, which is a compromise between my original price and your offer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
