Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is essential for a successful negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, and I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup option:**  While John is willing to pay $150, I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm responding to Bob's counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive and Persuasive:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the potential for a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The price of $140 is a significant move from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Further Lowering:**  If I counteroffer again, I risk pushing Bob away or ending up with a price that is too low for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is better than the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed profit rather than risk a potential loss in further negotiations with Bob."
