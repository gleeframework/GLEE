"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $950000 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate a lower price, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000. My revised offer is $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
