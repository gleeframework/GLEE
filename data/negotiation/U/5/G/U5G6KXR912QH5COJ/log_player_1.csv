{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my desired price, but we're still too far apart.  John's offer is significantly higher than any of Bob's, and it's important for me to maximize my profit.  I'm willing to accept a smaller profit than my ideal $15,000 if it means a much faster sale, but  $9,600 is not enough to satisfy that.  I'm choosing to sell to John instead."
