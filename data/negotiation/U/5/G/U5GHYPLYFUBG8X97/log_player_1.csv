"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not yet willing to sell to John as I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price point for Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good compromise. I've now exceeded my minimum threshold and there's a chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer. It's better to secure the deal at this point than risk getting a lower price or losing the sale to John."
