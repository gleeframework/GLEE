Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This reflects the product's value to me while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
