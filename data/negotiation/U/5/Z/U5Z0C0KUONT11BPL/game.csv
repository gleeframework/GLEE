"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to another buyer who's already offered me that amount.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
