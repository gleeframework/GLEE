"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about we start at $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $9,500.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and it allows you to make a profit. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession: how about we meet at $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a reasonable price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I need to make a bit more. How about we try $10,750? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and it's worth it for the value this product will bring to your business.",10750.0,Alice,7,
