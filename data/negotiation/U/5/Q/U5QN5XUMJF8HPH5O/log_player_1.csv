"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This gives me an opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again in the next round. I'm willing to consider selling to John at this point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000. It's a compromise that acknowledges Bob's reluctance to pay more, but still keeps me above my minimum. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is tempting, I believe I can push for a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,500.  This is getting closer to Bob's offer and I'm hoping it shows my willingness to compromise.  I'm running out of rounds and I want to see if we can finally reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is tempting, I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm running out of rounds, but I want to see if I can get closer to $14,000. It's worth trying one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise between our last offers. If Bob rejects, I will sell to John for $15,000."
