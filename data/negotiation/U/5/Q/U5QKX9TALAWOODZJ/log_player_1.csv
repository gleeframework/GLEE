Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  This is a good starting point as it is a little higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will incentivize Bob to counteroffer while still leaving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiation, it's not high enough for me. I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's less than what he's willing to pay, but it's also closer to my desired price of $9,000. I hope he will accept this offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation. There's no guarantee that a counteroffer from me would be accepted, and I could end up selling to John at the same price."
