"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's room for negotiation, making a counteroffer a better strategy than accepting or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my business needs. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might save Bob a few hundred dollars, but it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer at $11,500 is a good compromise and ensures Bob gets the product."
