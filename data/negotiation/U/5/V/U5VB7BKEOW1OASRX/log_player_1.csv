Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on it and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
