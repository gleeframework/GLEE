"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'd like to start the conversation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on it and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $987,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired value and me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",987500.0,Bob,4,
