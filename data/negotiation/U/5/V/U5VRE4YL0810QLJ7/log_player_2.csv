{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$18,000 is far above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Let's start with your maximum budget.  If Alice won't come down to $8,000, you're better off going with John."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$14,000 is still too high. You're still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're getting closer to your budget, and Alice might be getting more serious about making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's split the difference and see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway. $10,000 is a significant drop from $14,000 and still within your comfortable range."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice is coming down in price, but $13,000 is still above your goal. You've got a few rounds left, and if you're patient, you might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

You're inching closer to a deal. Let's go with $11,000. This shows Alice you're serious about buying, but you're not willing to go much higher."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, you're getting closer to your goal with each round. Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price. You still have a few rounds left to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

You're close to your budget. A slight increase to $11,500 might be enough to convince Alice. You're showing you're willing to budge, but still within your comfortable price range."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire. $12,000 is still too high for your budget.  You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, but she's not budging much further.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and save yourself some money."
