"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $125. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $140. It's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $140. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $155. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,5,
