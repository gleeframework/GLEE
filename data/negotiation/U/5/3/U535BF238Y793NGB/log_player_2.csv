"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to me and its potential benefit to you.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $14,000. While this is a good deal, Bob can get the same product from John for $15,000.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would be the better choice."
