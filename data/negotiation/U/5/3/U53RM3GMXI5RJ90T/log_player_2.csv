"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but it's still above my ideal price point. I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a better deal.  While I could buy from John for $1,000,000, I'm not desperate yet. I'm still within my rounds and believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,025,000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still looking for a bit more room.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a good sale.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target but it's still a bit above what I'm willing to pay.  I've already used several negotiation rounds, and it's becoming clear that Alice isn't going to budge much further. Since I'm running out of rounds and John is offering the product for my ideal price, it's best to move forward with his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
