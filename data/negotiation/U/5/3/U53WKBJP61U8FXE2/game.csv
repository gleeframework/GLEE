"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000. How about $12000?  It's a fair compromise and closer to where I can comfortably afford it.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
