Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

We're still leaving money on the table. While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have room to negotiate before accepting his offer or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but to be frank, I need to see the number a bit higher. Would you consider $1,375,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,325,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We're getting close to a point where squeezing further might make him walk away. However, another counteroffer might push us past the $1,350,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been great to work with, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. To be completely transparent, $1,350,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1350000

``` 

We're setting a firm but fair final price. This shows Bob we're serious while acknowledging his efforts.  Depending on his response, we can decide whether to accept a final offer from him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is signaling that he's reached his limit. He's sticking to his previous offer instead of meeting in the middle, and he's introduced the possibility of walking away. While we could try to squeeze a little more, it's risky. Bob might be serious about his limit, and we'd lose the deal entirely. Accepting his $1,300,000 offer is tempting, but John's guaranteed $1,200,000 is the safer and smarter choice at this point. It minimizes risk and guarantees a strong profit."
