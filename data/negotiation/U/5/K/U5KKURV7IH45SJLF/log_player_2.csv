"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an offer on the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Bob might be able to secure a price closer to his target of $9,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $10,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price and save as much money as possible.  Although Alice has stated this is her ""final offer"",  Bob can still attempt to negotiate a lower price. If this doesn't work, he can always fall back on buying from John, but it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,750, which is closer to your previous offer.  This is a fair price considering we've both made concessions.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I can see that we're getting close, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $10,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while Bob could try to negotiate further, he's already come close to his target price of $9,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $10,250 is a good compromise, saving Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John."
