"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
