"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the potential value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need a bit more than $1000000.  The product is truly unique and has a lot of potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1250000. How about we try $1125000? I think this is a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
