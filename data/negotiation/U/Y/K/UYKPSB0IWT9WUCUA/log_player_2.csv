"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000.  I know how valuable this will be for you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a profit. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer."
