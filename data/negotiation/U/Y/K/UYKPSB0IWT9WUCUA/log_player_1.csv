Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000.  I know how valuable this will be for you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob is willing to pay significantly more. Our goal is to get as close to his valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the price as fair, encouraging him to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. We might need to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
