Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong starting point, aiming for a significant profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** A high initial offer allows me to maximize my potential earnings. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,500,000 is ambitious, it leaves room for Bob to counter with a lower price. 
* **Strategic Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely. 

This initial offer creates a framework for a potentially profitable negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting Minimum Value:** Selling for less than $1,000,000 goes against my established minimum.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position and leverage in the negotiation.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer of $1,500,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to meet halfway, hopefully leading to a faster agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $1,200,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still considers it too high.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  I'm trying to avoid a stalemate or a lengthy back-and-forth negotiation that could lead to a less favorable outcome for me.

This counteroffer is a strategic step in the negotiation, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's also a reasonable compromise, considering my previous offer of $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum Value:**  Accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoid any potential losses.
* **Potential for Profit:**  While it's not my initial asking price, $1,050,000 still offers a reasonable profit.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Accepting this offer avoids further back-and-forth negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome.

By accepting this offer, I secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements and potentially allows me to move on to other opportunities."
