"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. For you, this product is worth $120, and I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its significant worth to you. Don't miss out on this chance to own it at a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $120.
* Alice is offering the product for $100.
* While this is a good deal, you can get the same product from John for $120, which is your maximum price. 
* Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
