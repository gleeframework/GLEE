I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $125. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $175.  It's a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground!"
