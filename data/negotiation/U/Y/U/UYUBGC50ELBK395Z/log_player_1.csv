"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum asking price, I believe I can do better. Bob's counteroffer was very low, and it's worth seeing if I can push him higher. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit. I hope Bob will see that this is a fair price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  If things continue to stall, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to offer $1,300,000.  This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm not willing to go that far down from my minimum asking price, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
