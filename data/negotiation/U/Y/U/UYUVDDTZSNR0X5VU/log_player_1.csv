"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired range.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is a good deal for me considering I'm only four rounds in. It's also a good compromise that indicates Bob is serious about buying the product. Accepting now ensures I get a decent price and avoid risking a lower offer in the following rounds."
