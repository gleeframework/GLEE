"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it could bring to my business. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly below the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $850,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $850,000 is a bit too high for my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,4,
