"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item holds a significant value to us at $15,000, reflecting its quality and uniqueness. Given its worth to you is estimated at $10,000, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. I kindly invite you to consider purchasing it for $12,000. Should you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to either get a better price from Alice or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
