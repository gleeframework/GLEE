"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $860,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",860000.0,Alice,5,
