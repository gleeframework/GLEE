"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9000. It's still a great deal considering its value and rarity.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $8500. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $8750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more adjustment to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product for $8700. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
