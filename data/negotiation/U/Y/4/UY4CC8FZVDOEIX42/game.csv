"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,250,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale, and $1,250,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we discuss this price?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
