# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my budget, but closer. It's worth trying another counteroffer before going to John.  There's still room for negotiation."
