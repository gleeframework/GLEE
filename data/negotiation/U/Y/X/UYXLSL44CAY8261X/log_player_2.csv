"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,000 is more than his maximum budget and he can get a better deal.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $8,500 is within his budget, he's still paying more than he'd like.  He should counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired limit. John offers a price that aligns perfectly with Bob's budget, and further negotiation with Alice might not yield a better outcome within the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
