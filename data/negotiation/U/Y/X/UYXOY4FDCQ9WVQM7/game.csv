"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000, but let's talk and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget concerns. While $22,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value in the long run.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000, which I think is fair considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize the value you see in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
