Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000, but let's talk and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000, which I think is fair considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize the value you see in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below my $15,000 threshold.  I can secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
