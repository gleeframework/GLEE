Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point for negotiation. I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects outright, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also still willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to Bob for $12,000 than to sell to John for the same price.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better deal with further negotiations, and it's a risk I'm not willing to take."
