It's much too expensive.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significant discount, hoping to get Alice to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget."

While $15,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to try and get a better price."

I'm going to increase my offer a bit, but still stay below my maximum budget. I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also want a fair price."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly again, but still stay below my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also want a fair price.  This is a good compromise, as it's a good price for me, and if Alice accepts, it's a good deal for her too."

Alice and I are not close to an agreement. At this point, it's clear that I can get the product from John for a better price, saving me $2,500.  I'll go with John."
