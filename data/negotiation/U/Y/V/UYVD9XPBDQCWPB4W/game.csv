"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6800, which is my absolute maximum budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. Can you consider it?",6800.0,Bob,6,
