Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'd love it! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than Bob's value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $65 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $77.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 77.50}
