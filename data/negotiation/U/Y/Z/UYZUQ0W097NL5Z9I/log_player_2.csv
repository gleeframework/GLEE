"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent deal, you can likely get a better price.  There's room for negotiation, and you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's offer of $120 is a compromise, and it's closer to your desired price point. 
* **Value for Money:**  The product is still worth more than $120 to you (your maximum is $150), so it's a good deal.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in Alice walking away or further delays.  

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
