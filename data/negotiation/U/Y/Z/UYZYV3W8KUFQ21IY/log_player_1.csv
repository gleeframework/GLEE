Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100.  I believe it's worth a lot more, but I'm offering you this exclusive price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product for $120 (Bob's maximum valuation), it's unlikely he would accept. My goal is to get the highest price *he* is willing to pay. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $100 is a strong offer that allows Bob to realize significant value ($20 profit) while still granting me a substantial profit ($20 over my minimum).
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides me with a safety net. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
