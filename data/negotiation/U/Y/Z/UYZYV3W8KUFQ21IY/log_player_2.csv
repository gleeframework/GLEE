"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100.  I believe it's worth a lot more, but I'm offering you this exclusive price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd pay $100 instead of $120.
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  The product is worth $120 to you, and you're paying $100. This is a good deal, even though Alice values it at $80."
