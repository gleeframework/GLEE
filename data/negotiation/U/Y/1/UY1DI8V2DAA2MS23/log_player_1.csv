(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky one! Bob is now offering my absolute minimum to break even. There's a chance he might go slightly higher, but there's also a risk he walks away. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** Guarantees I don't lose money, but I don't make a profit either.
* **Rejecting:** Risks him walking away, but I *might* be able to squeeze out a little more.
* **John:** My safety net, guarantees no profit but no loss either.

I'm a little risk-averse in this situation.  

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I might be able to get a slightly better price, taking Bob's offer at my break-even point guarantees I don't lose money. It's not ideal, but it's better than the potential downsides of pushing further."
