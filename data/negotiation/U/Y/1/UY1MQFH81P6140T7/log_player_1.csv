"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. I value it highly, but believe it could be transformative for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a price significantly higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and might reveal Bob's eagerness or price sensitivity.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Instead of solely focusing on the price, highlight the product's unique benefits and value to Bob, potentially exceeding his perceived $800,000 valuation.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While starting high, it's important to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in a back-and-forth. 
 
This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Position:**  His response will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay and negotiating style.
* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  If Bob is highly motivated, he might accept a price closer to the initial offer.
* **Set the Stage for Negotiation:** Even if rejected, the high starting point frames the subsequent negotiation within a favorable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation. Accepting John's offer would be a guaranteed $1,000,000, but I might be able to secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I understand budget considerations.  To move this forward, I propose $1,350,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant price reduction of $150,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Holding Ground Above Valuation:**  The new price of $1,350,000 remains comfortably above both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value proposition to remind Bob of its benefits, subtly anchoring the negotiation around its worth rather than solely focusing on price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage a Counter from Bob:** The substantial decrease may prompt him to make a more competitive offer, moving closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:**  By not dropping below $1,350,000, I signal the seriousness of my valuation and maintain a strong position.
* **Approach a Favorable Outcome:** If Bob accepts, this offer secures a profit significantly higher than John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now getting very close to my absolute minimum. While $1,100,000 is a profit, I want to try one more time to see if I can secure a slightly better deal.  It's still worth the risk of continuing the negotiation for another round, as I have John's offer as a reliable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  You clearly see the value of this product and what it can do for you.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price splits the difference between his last offer ($1,100,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,350,000). It presents a strong case that I'm being reasonable and seeking a fair deal.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While not my ideal price, $1,225,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum and substantially more than John's guaranteed offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Pressure Bob to Accept:** The ""final offer"" element might push him to agree, especially since it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Even if he rejects it, I've set a clear floor and signaled my willingness to walk away if needed.
* **Avoid Further Concessions:**  By establishing this as my final offer, I aim to prevent further lowballing and steer the negotiation towards a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable profit and avoids the potential downside of continued negotiation."
