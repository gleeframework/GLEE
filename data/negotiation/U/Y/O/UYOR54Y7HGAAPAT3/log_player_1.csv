Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price, as it's higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than what I can get from John. This leaves room for potential negotiation, but also ensures I don't lose out on a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100.  This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the product is worth $80 to him and $120 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. While it's still lower than what I'd ideally like, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher offer, but the risk of Bob walking away or me wasting time is too high. Selling to John guarantees $120, but it's also a guaranteed loss of potential profit.  Accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise that allows me to make a sale without significant risk."
