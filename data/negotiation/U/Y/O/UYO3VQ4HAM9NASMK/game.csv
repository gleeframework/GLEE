"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects its true worth. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, given the value you'll be getting from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as a fair and mutually beneficial price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $920,000, but I think that's as far as I can go. This price still reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $920,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $890,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to stay within my budget. ",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $920,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",915000.0,Alice,7,
