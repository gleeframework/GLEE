"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
