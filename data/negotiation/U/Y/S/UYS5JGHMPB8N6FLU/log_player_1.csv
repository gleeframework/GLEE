"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport.  This strategy aims to test Bob's initial interest and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe $10000 would be a fair price for it. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, there's potential to get more.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price.  It's important to remember that 10 rounds is a lot, and there's no rush to settle for the minimum right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come up a bit to $12,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes both the product's value and fairness, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-ended:** The ""Let me know what you think"" invites further dialogue and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my research and understanding of the market value, I would like to propose $11000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since we're already in Round 4, there is a significant chance that we could get stuck in a back-and-forth scenario where the price doesn't increase much further.  Accepting his offer now guarantees a sale that is only slightly below my initial target.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk a stalemate or losing the deal."
