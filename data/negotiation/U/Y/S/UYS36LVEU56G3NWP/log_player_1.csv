Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves more potential profit on the table. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $1,500,000 is a reasonable starting point, high enough to be profitable but not so high that Bob will immediately reject it. It encourages a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides security. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still walk away with a decent profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to counter his offer, accept it, or switch to John based on:

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** If it's close to my desired price or seems reasonable, I might counter with a slightly lower price. 
* **Bob's Stance:** If Bob seems unwilling to negotiate or his counteroffers are too low, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it and walk away with $1,000,000, I'm not satisfied with just the minimum. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to maximize my profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and keeps the possibility of a better price alive. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John right now would be the safe option, but it would mean settling for my minimum. I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than his offer, but closer to his offer than my initial offer. I will aim to find a balance between securing a profit and keeping the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $1,000,000 and my previous offer of $1,500,000. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Maintaining a Distance from John:**  By offering $1,250,000, I keep a $250,000 difference between my offer and John's price. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation, as I still have a backup option that is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  While this offer is still higher than Bob's initial price, it is a significant decrease from my first offer. This could increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, especially if he truly sees value in the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I have a successful negotiation. 
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I will be prepared to make another counteroffer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's counteroffers and his negotiating behavior. 
* **Assess John's Offer:**  I will continue to keep John's offer in mind, but I won't be quick to switch to him.  I want to explore all possibilities with Bob before accepting John's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 than my previous counteroffer. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** While I would ideally get closer to my initial price, accepting this offer still allows me to secure a profit of $150,000, which is a good outcome.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further or becoming unwilling to negotiate at all. This could lead to me ultimately accepting John's offer of $1,000,000, which would mean a smaller profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Negotiation Complete:** This decision marks the end of the negotiation with Bob. I have successfully sold the product for a price that is acceptable and profitable."
