"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than its value to me. I can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy it from John instead.
