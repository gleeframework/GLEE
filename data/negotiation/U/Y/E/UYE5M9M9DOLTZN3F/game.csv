"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the value it brings to my business.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the price.  However, I need to stay within my budget. I can offer you $775,000, which I think is a very fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,7,
