Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and hopefully earn more. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a better agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $1,350,000? This still gives you a significant value for the product while allowing me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,300,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price, and I'm comfortable accepting it. It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether by rejecting his offer."
