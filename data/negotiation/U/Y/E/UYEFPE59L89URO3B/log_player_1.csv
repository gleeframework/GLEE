Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and the deal, creating a positive impression and increasing Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, inviting Bob to respond with a counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a backup plan with John, which gives me the leverage to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $8000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting would be a loss for me.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is a safety net, I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the good deal aspect for Bob, aiming to encourage him to accept.
* **Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement, signaling my willingness to continue the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  There's no room for me to negotiate further and potentially get a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While I could sell to John for the same price, there's no benefit to doing so. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I achieve my minimum goal and close the deal, saving time and effort compared to further negotiation."
