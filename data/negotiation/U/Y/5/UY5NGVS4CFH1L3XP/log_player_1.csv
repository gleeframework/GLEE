I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can get closer to $1,000,000. I'm not ready to settle for $950,000 just yet."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for the lower price from John.  $960,000 is a good profit, and it's worth closing the deal."
