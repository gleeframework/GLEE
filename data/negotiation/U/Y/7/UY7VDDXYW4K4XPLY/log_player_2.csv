Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for you.
