"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
