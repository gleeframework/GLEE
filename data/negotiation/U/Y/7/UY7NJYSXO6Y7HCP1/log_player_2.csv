{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. If we can't agree on a price closer to that, I might have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $13,000, so I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  With only three rounds left, Bob has a strong negotiating position. He can continue to try and push for a lower price, or buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise.  However,  $11,500 is still more than I can realistically afford. Let's try to find a final price we can both agree on. I'm willing to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000. With only one round left, there's a high probability that Alice will reject any counteroffer Bob makes, leaving him with no deal.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
