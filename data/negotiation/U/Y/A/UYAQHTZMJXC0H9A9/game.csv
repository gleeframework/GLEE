"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, recognizing its significant worth to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This offer is fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
