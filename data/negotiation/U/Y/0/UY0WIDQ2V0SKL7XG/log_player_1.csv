{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also frames the offer as fair, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.  By opening with a higher price, you set a baseline for the negotiation and leave yourself room to make concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  By rejecting his offer, you maintain your leverage and can continue negotiating for a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I believe we can still find common ground. Would $775,000 be a reasonable price for the product?
