"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in your product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $95? It's still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,4,
