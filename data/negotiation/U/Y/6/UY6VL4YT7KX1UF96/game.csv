"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $130 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $125. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
