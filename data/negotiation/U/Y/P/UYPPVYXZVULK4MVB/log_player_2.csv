"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $14,000, considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  The counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. However, it's not so low as to be insulting, leaving room for a compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob acknowledges the product's value but emphasizes his own perception of its worth, justifying his lower offer. 
* **Opens the Door to Discussion:**  The message invites further discussion, allowing Alice to either accept, counter, or engage in more negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair deal considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and $13,000 is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Value Gap:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his next offer and potentially stalling the deal is high.  
* **Time Pressure:**  Each round brings Bob closer to having to purchase from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a deal within his budget."
