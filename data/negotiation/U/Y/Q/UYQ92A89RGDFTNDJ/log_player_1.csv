Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, given its features and benefits. I'm initially offering it for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is very low and doesn't leave much room for negotiation upwards. It's clear he knows the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bring him up a bit.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your quick response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's a very fair offer considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is definitely interested and negotiating.  While $11,000 is still less than ideal, it's a reasonable gain over John's offer.
