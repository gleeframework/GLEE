Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a favorable deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he intends to negotiate down, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if you had started lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers your minimum acceptable price, securing a deal with Bob above that price is ideal. Starting high allows you to potentially make more money before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is quite good, it's still below my initial asking price.  There's room to negotiate further and try to close the gap.  Rejecting at this stage keeps the negotiation open, and I can aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the product's value, I had a higher number in mind.  Would you consider $1,825,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to meet you partway."", ""product_price"": 1825000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,900,000) and Bob's offer ($1,700,000) with a slight bias towards my desired price. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving down, I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and compromise, which can help build rapport.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm still aiming high, keeping the pressure on Bob to either accept a price above his initial offer or to counter with a more aggressive proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's $250,000 above my minimum acceptable price and a healthy profit margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield slightly more, but the risk of Bob walking away increases.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now puts cash in hand quicker, which has its own value.

While I started higher, accepting this offer represents a successful negotiation outcome."
