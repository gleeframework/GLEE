"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation as the product is worth $10,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is worth $15,000 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $14,000, and still within Bob's budget. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and the price could rise back to $14,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a higher price."
