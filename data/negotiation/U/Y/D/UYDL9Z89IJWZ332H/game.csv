"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is a great compromise. It's still a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
