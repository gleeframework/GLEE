(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to inflate the product's value to you.  While you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, you know John will sell it for that price.  Rejecting Alice's offer pushes her to either lower her price or lets you buy from John without feeling like you missed out."
