It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $500,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will give me room to negotiate upwards if necessary, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

$400,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  $350,000 is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers."

Alice is coming down in price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only by $50,000. I want to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go too much higher."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is back to her original price.  While that's a decent deal, I still think I can get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

I'm going to split the difference between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince her to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now asking for more than her initial price.  While I could try another counteroffer, there's a risk she'll continue to raise her price.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk ending up with a worse deal.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
