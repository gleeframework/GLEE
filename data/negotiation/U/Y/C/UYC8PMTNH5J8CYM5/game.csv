"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $13,000 is out of my budget. I am confident that I can find an equivalent product elsewhere for less. I am willing to pay up to $11,000 for this product. Let me know if this is a feasible offer for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
