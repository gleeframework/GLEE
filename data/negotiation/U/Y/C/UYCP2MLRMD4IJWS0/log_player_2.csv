# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"",

``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still above your maximum and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."

{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair compromise."",

This counter-offer aims to split the difference between her current offer ($140) and your previous offer ($100), while still staying below your maximum budget."
