Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, and I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,500 is still too low for me, and I have a few more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,800? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $9,600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $12,000, it's getting late in the negotiations and $9,600 is a decent price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for less than I'd hoped."
