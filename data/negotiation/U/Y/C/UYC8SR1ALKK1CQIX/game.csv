,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,800 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,900?",10900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,450. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10450.0,Bob,4,
