Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,800 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,900?"", 
""product_price"": 10900
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,450. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.  We're getting closer to a price point that works for both of us. I'm not willing to go as low as $10,450, but I can concede a bit more to keep him engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now. How about $10,700? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 10700
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm coming down a bit more, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.
* **Creates urgency:**  By stating it's my final offer, I'm encouraging Bob to make a decision now rather than dragging out the negotiation. 
* **Remains profitable:**  $10,700 is still a significant profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, $10,500 is a strong offer and meets my minimum requirement. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds and ensures I make a good profit."
