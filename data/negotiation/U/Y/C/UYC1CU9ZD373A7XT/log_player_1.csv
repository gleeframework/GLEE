"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the product's value and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

By starting high, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation at a point favorable to me. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for potentially securing a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a strong offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to pay a premium over my minimum, but his message also suggests he's eager to make a deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still allowing for some bargaining space."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial assessment.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still anchoring the negotiation above Bob's initial bid.
* **Simplified Proposal:**  Offering a single, clear number makes it easier for Bob to accept and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** My message implies that I value the product highly and am not desperate to close the deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a compromise. My counteroffer is $925,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller.  $925,000 is a significant profit margin, and continuing to negotiate risks alienating Bob or pushing him away from the deal entirely.  It's time to accept a win-win outcome."
