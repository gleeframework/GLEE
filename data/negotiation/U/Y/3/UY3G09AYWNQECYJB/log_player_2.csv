Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250. This is the best I can do. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price point. You've already been through several rounds and you only have 3 rounds left.  You can't guarantee that you'll get the product for your desired price by continuing to negotiate. It's better to buy from John at $10,000, which is a price you're comfortable with and a guaranteed deal."
