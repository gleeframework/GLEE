Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it can benefit you significantly. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John, she has room to negotiate.  Starting at $15,000 allows for potential profit without immediately scaring Bob away.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and benefits, creating a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know what you think!"" suggests Alice is willing to discuss the price, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** If Alice knew the general market value for similar products, she could adjust her offer accordingly. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice had insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., whether he's likely to negotiate aggressively), she could tailor her approach."
