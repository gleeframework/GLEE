"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
