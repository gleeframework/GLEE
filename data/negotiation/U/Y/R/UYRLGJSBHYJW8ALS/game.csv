"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $150, but that's my absolute top limit.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $150. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
