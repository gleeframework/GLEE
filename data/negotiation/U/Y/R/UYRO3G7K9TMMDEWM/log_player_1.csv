Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $145, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and avoids making him feel pressured.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By asking for his thoughts, I'm inviting a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:**  I can always go to John for $150 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $145 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John at $150 is a guaranteed profit, so I'm not desperate to accept a drastically low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  $125 is a compromise that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Highlighting the ""good deal"" for Bob can increase his willingness to accept.
* **Maintain Profit Margin:**  $125 is still above my minimum threshold of $150, ensuring I don't lose money."
