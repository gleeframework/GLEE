"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum price, it's still below what you'd like to earn. Since you have 10 rounds, there's still room for negotiation and potential to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go. This product is worth a lot to you, so I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to your ideal price,  you are still within the negotiation rounds, and there's a good chance you can get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $92.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but considering the number of rounds left and the potential of not getting a higher offer from Bob, accepting his $87 offer is the best option.  It's only $3 less than what John would pay, and it secures the sale rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
