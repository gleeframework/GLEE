"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects the potential value you'll gain from owning it. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the highest price I am willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I had in mind.  The product's value to you is significantly higher, and I'm confident we can find a price that reflects that. How about $1,225,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure it'll be a worthwhile investment for you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
