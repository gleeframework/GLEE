Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's still potential for you to increase the price if he's willing to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value and that you're willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what you're hoping to achieve.  You have a good chance to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. You can counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still leave a good profit for you and get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
