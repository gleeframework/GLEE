"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to consider. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price, and waiting introduces the risk of losing the deal."
