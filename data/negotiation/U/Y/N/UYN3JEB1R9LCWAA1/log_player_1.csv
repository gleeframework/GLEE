I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers based on his responses and his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet. I'll try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a profit above my minimum threshold.  I believe this price is fair considering my product's value and Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and also higher than John's offer. Accepting this deal allows me to maximize my profit while avoiding further negotiation."
