"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still more than your maximum value of $100.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is still above my maximum value of $100.  However, it's a significant discount from Alice's offer, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I can still go with John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is still above my maximum value of $100.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $100 and avoid further negotiation."
