"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. To be fair, I can drop to $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you call that a middle ground? It seems we're still quite far apart.  While I'm serious about purchasing this product, $1,250,000 is just not feasible. My final offer is $750,000.  Let me know if you can work with that.",750000.0,Bob,6,
