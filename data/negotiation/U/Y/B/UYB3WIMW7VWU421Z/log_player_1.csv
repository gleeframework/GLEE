"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the product's value to me.  I'm confident that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his $8,000 valuation, especially if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm open to negotiation,  $9,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping to find a price point that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he's inching closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $10,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still wary of selling too low.  I'm  considering John's offer, but I'm hoping we can close this deal with Bob in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  John's offer ensures I get the best possible price."
