"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Considering its value and your interest, I propose we make it yours for $140. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, given your appreciation for the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140.  While this is a good deal, you can get it for $150 from John if you reject Alice's offer.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
