"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm not sure what the product is worth, and I'd like to negotiate a better price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it holds significant value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $850000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal at this point, and we can both move on.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $875000, but I'm still not convinced that's the right price. How about we try $825000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
