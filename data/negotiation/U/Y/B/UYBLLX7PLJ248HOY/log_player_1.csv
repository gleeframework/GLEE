Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this time. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 right now.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I have room to negotiate and time to try for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take this offer than risk him walking away in further rounds."
