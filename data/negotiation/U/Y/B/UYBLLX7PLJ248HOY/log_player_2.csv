Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this time. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 right now.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.
