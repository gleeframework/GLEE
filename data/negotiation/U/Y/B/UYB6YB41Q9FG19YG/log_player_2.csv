"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a significant value to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I will be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd save $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **It's within your budget.**  The $1,000,000 price is below your maximum of $1,200,000. 

While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a good price."
