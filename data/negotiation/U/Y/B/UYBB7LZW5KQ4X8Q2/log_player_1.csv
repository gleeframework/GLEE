Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a higher price than John's offer.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** This price shows you understand the product's worth while acknowledging that Bob also benefits significantly from the deal."
