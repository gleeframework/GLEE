"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $925,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll buy from John, paying the same price as your maximum value. This gives you no advantage over buying from John directly. However, rejecting the offer opens the door for potential negotiation with Alice."
