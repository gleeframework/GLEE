"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product for $11,250. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
