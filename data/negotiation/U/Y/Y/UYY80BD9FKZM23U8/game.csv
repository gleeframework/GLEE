"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is definitely interesting to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $600,000?  That would work much better for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $600,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $675,000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to get.",675000.0,Alice,7,
