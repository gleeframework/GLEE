# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $600,000?  That would work much better for me."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $600,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 625000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $675,000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Alice has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate but is also holding firm to a price above $650,000.  While we might be able to get the price down a little more in the remaining rounds, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting the $675,000 offer secures a good deal for us without risking the price going up or losing the opportunity altogether."
