"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $12,000. This is the highest I can go at this time.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  Let's split the difference - how about $14,000? That's a fair compromise and leaves some room for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
