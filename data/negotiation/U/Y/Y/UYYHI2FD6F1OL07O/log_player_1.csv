"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $200,000 more than its worth to him. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging while highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate down while still securing a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $500,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left and the option of selling to John for a much higher price, so I'm not willing to settle for Bob's offer yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob is unwilling to budge, I have the option to sell to John and ensure a much higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $800,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is within Bob's stated comfort zone.
* **Message:** I'm being firm but still friendly, acknowledging Bob's previous offer while reiterating the value proposition for him.  

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more assertive approach, aiming to close the gap between our offers. This is a strategic move to potentially secure a faster deal while still maintaining my profit margin.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reassess my options and potentially consider selling to John, depending on how many rounds remain."
