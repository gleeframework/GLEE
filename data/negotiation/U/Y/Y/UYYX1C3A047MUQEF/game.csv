"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,850,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference at $1,875,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",1875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll counteroffer at $1,825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
