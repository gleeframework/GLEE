"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a limited time at the price of $200.  I think it's a great deal for something of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget, and $200 is a bit out of my range. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might be a bit high, but $120 is too low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so how about we try $145? I think that's a fair price for the value the product offers.",145.0,Bob,4,
