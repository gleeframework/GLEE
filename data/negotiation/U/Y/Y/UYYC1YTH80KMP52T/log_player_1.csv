Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm aware of the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
