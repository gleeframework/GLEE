Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $100, you aim for a price slightly below his valuation while staying above your minimum.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll at least get your minimum price if Bob declines. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and ensuring you don't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
