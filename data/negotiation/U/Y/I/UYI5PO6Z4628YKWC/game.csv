"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position. While I believe $1,050,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to show my commitment to this deal. I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. But I'm willing to make a small concession to $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $975,000.  I believe that's a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,025,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,012,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, and I'd like to see if we can finalize it.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm thinking that the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,005,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
