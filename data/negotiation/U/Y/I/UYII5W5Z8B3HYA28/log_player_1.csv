Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive and won't be available for long."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below this is instantly accepted, but doesn't maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of an extra $400,000 is worth the calculated gamble."
