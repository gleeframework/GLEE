"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is already a fairly competitive price.  Could you meet me halfway at $110?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $100 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we possibly meet at that point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

At this point, it's clear Bob is unwilling to budge above $100. Since you have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
