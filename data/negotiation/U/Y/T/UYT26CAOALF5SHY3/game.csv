"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $125? It's still a great deal for a product worth $120 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, which is the value I place on it. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,4,
