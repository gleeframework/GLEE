"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  However, I'm aiming to spend a bit less. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, accepting this offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of running out of time. 
* **Future Opportunities:** Even if Bob could get a slightly lower price, the potential gain might not be significant enough to justify the risk of losing the deal altogether."
