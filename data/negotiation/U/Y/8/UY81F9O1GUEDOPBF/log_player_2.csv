"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still above his target price of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,280,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1260000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1290000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price, but Alice is only willing to go down a little bit at a time. They're now at $1,290,000, which is still $290,000 more than Bob's target price.  With only 3 rounds left, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further, and Bob is risking losing out on the deal with John. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and guarantee the product at his target price."
