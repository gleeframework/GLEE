"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to have a successful transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
