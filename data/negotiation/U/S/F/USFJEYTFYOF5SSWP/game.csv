"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $800,000. Would that work for you?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price still allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
