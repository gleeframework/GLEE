Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your operations. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so this gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It allows for some back-and-forth negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of getting a good price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $800,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum and even lower than his own initial assessment of the product's worth. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.  

Rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round allows you to:

* **Maintain your negotiating position:** You demonstrate you're not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Explore potential counteroffers:** You can try to push Bob closer to your desired price point. 

Selling to John is always an option, but at this point, you haven't fully explored the negotiation with Bob.  There's still a chance to get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price still allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This approach shows you're willing to compromise while still securing a price closer to your initial offer. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** Emphasizing a ""fair margin"" for both parties can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Staying above your minimum:**  While this counteroffer is lower than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

This strategy aims to maintain a positive negotiating tone while pushing Bob towards a more favorable price point."
