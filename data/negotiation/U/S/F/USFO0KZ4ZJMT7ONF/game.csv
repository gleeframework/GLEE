"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $15,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while still staying within my range.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's try $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
