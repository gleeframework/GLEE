Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to jump to $13,500.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $13,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while still staying within my range."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's try $14,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. We're getting closer, but I'm not willing to pay $14,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal.  If she rejects that, I'll buy from John."
