"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $200? I'm open to negotiation, of course.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $200 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay up to $100. Would you be open to considering that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $150 for the product? I believe this price reflects its true value while staying within your budget.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. As I mentioned before, my maximum budget is $100. If you're willing to come down to that, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we aim for $125 for the product? This price still allows us to discuss further if there are any additional benefits or services you would like included.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still beyond my limit. I'm firm on my maximum budget of $100.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to buy.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your firm stance and understanding your budget constraints, how about we aim for $110 for the product? This price reflects a compromise between our positions and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial transaction.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However,  $110 is still outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and ready to buy right now, but my maximum is $100. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. If not,  I'm going to have to move on to other options.",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try $105 as the price for the product. This is a bit closer to your maximum budget, and I hope it will allow us to reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still just a bit out of reach for my budget. I'm ready to buy right now, but $100 is my absolute limit.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to look at other options.",100.0,Bob,10,
