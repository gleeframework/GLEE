{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's value of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also below my minimum value of $120, so I'm still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $88 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's offer of $88 is significantly below my minimum value of $120, and I don't see much room for further negotiation to get a price that's closer to my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's the most rational decision in this situation."
