,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,120,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1,050,000. I really want to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget. Please consider this final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
