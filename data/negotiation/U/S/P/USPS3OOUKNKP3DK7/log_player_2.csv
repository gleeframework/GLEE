Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980,000. I'm willing to make one final concession to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,040,000.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're running out of rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, the potential gains from further negotiation are shrinking.
* **Alice is firming up:** Her language suggests this is her best offer. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Significant savings:**  We've already negotiated a price significantly lower than both her initial offer and John's price.

While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting at $1,040,000 secures a good price and avoids the higher cost from John."
