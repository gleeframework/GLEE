"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to move this product, so let's wrap this up.  How about $980,000 and we call it a deal?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $980,000. I'm willing to make one final concession to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,040,000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
