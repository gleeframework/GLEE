"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is still a bit below my expectations. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
