Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate and maximize my earnings.  However, if he rejects outright, I'm prepared to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I want to test the waters a bit more with a counteroffer and see if Bob is truly serious about this product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below my expectations. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1300000. I hope this is a closer alignment towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,300,000, which is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could potentially try for more, I'm risk-averse and don't want to lose out on this deal.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still a chance I might get a higher price from another buyer or from Bob in the future, but I'm going to take this offer and secure the sale."
