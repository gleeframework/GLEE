""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob for slightly above his valuation ($800,000), our goal is to maximize profit. We know John will pay the full $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,200,000 creates a strong negotiating position. 
    * It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
    * It's substantially above Bob's perceived value, giving us room for potential negotiation if he counter-offers.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  We don't know Bob's personality. If he's highly risk-averse, he might accept this offer. If he's a tough negotiator, we need to be prepared to counter-offer or potentially walk away. 
* **Relationship Value:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, we might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a positive experience. However, the prompt prioritizes maximizing our profit on this sale."
