"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the market value, the product's unique features and long-term benefits justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
