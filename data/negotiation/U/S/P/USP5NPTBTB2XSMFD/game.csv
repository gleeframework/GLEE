"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer in this range.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I can go down to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  This offer represents a significant opportunity for you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little, but that's still far too high for me. I can do $1,100,000, but if we can't agree on that I think it's best I move on. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to drop to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial concession and a great opportunity for you to acquire this asset.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks. I do feel like we're getting somewhere. To be fair to us both, how about we split the difference and land at $1,250,000?  That's the best I can do.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
