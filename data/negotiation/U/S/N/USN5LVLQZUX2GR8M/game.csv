"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and my budget constraints. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll come down to $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to work within my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway once again and offer $1,112,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1112500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,112,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll come down to $1,120,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
