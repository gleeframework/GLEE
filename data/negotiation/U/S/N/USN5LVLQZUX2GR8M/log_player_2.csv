# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2

This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll come down to $1,120,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob is running out of time. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's Offer:**  This would save him some money compared to buying from John, but it's still a significant amount above his desired price point.
2. **Buy from John:** This is the safer option. John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget.

Considering the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and the limited time remaining, it's more prudent for Bob to purchase from John. It guarantees the product at his desired price and ensures a successful transaction."
