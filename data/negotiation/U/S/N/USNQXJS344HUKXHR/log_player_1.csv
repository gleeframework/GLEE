Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price ($800,000)  allows you to be more assertive with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
