"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $13,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,7,
