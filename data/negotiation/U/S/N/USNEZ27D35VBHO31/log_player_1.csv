"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bit of a gamble, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can start the negotiation process."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $10,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will find acceptable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a bit higher than Bob's offer, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway to close the deal. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I want to secure a decent price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price. We only have four rounds left, and I want to make sure I get as close to my initial asking price as possible. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,800. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering we're running out of rounds. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid risking losing the deal completely."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're in the 8th round, and time is running out.  While $8,200 is slightly less than I hoped for, it's still above my minimum of $8,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
