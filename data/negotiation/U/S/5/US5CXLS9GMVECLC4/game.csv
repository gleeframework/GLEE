"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $825,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $787,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $787,500. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer $812,500. It's a compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit.",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit to $800,000. This reflects a serious offer on my part, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,
