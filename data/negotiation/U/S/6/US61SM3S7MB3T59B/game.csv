"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly above that mark. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1,050,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
