"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $7,500. I believe this is a fair price and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
