Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reaching out. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $7,500. I believe this is a fair price and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
