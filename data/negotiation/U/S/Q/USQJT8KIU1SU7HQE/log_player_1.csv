{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $80, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $105? It's a fair price for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
