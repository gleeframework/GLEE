"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very reasonable price. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is likely overselling the product's value to you.** She claims it's worth at least $150, but you've already established your maximum price is $150. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. Alice might be willing to lower her price to make the sale. 
* **Your fallback option is $150.** While you aim to save money, buying from John guarantees you get the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
