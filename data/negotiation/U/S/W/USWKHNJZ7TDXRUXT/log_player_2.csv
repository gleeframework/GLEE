"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high.  It is significantly above your maximum budget, and there's no reason to accept it at this stage. It makes more sense to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your budgetary constraints. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,650,000? This price reflects some flexibility on my end while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a slight improvement, it's still above my maximum budget. It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

This offer is a good compromise, as it falls in between our previous positions and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
