Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay  $1,300,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value you place on it and my ability to purchase it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I understand the value of the product, $1,650,000 is still outside my range.  I'm comfortable with $1,400,000.  This offer is a good compromise, as it falls in between our previous positions and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both of us.
