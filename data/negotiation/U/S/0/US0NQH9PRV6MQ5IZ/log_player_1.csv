Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is ideal. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  The price needs to be attractive to Bob (who values it at $1,000,000) but still profitable for you. $1,150,000 provides a potential $150,000 profit for you while being a significant discount for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation, and there's a chance Bob might counter-offer or reject the initial price.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his response."
