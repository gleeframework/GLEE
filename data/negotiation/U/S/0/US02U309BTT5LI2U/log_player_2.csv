**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly coming down, but it's unlikely she will move much below $1,000,000.  We are in round 9, and while we could push to the final round, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice not budging. Accepting at $1,007,500 secures the product at a reasonable price."
