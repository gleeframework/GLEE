"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm keen to purchase the product, but I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high. How about we settle at $900,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, I'm sticking to my valuation.  Would you consider $950,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
