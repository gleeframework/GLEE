"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $650,000 is closer, but to be honest, my budget is tight. Could we settle on $620,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",620000.0,Bob,4,
