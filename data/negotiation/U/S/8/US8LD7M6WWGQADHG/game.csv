"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That way we both get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but no higher. Can you consider that?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. However, $9,900 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, at $10,000.  That's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,7,
