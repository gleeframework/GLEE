Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price.  Would you be willing to pay $90 for it?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 gives Bob the feeling of potentially getting a deal, while still leaving you with a significant profit.
* **Avoid a Too-High Offer:** If you start too high (e.g., $95 or more), you risk alienating Bob and forcing him to reject the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
