Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum value of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price down slightly or up slightly depending on his counteroffer. 

This approach gives you a good chance to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it doesn't leave any room for potential profit.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value.  There's still a chance you can get closer to your ideal price of $10,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a good deal for both of us and allows me to keep the product in my inventory."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll try one last time. How about $8,500? It's still within my budget, and it's closer to my maximum price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than your desired price of $9,000.  Considering you have a backup buyer willing to pay $8,000, accepting this offer makes sense:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's a fair compromise:** It's a reasonable middle ground between your last offer and Bob's last offer.
* **It avoids further negotiation:**  You've gone through a few rounds, and continuing to counteroffer could prolong the negotiation without guarantee of a better price. 

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or you having to settle for the lower price from John."
