Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $720,000.

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is down to $720,000.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively could backfire.  Alice might dig in, and we're already getting a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's backup price. It's better to secure the deal now at a price well below our maximum budget."
