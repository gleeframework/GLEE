"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? I think this is a fair price that would allow us to come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
