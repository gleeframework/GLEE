(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of saving as much as possible.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This price is well below her initial offer but still within a reasonable range for me.  If she's serious about selling, she should at least consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's not enough yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to buying from John.  I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below $1,100,000.  This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further.  However, I'm still determined to see if I can get the price down further. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time, but only slightly. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than Alice's last one. If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but not as much as I hoped. I have only a few rounds left, and while I'd like to save more,  $1,120,000 is still a good price compared to John's offer.  I'll accept and avoid the risk of running out of time and having to pay John's higher price."
