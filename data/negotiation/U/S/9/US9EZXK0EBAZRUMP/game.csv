,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $100?  This is still a great price for a quality product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
