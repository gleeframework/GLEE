"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $130 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
