Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint might push Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's always a chance Bob might accept an offer higher than that. It's a balancing act between securing a good sale and potentially maximizing profit."
