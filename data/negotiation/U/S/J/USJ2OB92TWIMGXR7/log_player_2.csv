"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a decent profit for Alice ($20 above her value) and significantly lower than her initial offer. This counteroffer allows for some room to negotiate while still being within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $130 is a better deal than buying from John for $150. While I would have preferred a lower price, this offer is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. Further negotiation could potentially lower the price, but there is a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees I get the product for a price within my budget."
