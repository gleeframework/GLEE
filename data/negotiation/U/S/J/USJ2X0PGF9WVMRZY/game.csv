"Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $900,000 is closer to my target price, but I still need to make a profit. How about $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $912,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $918,750. This is a small step up from your offer and closer to my target price.  We're getting closer to a deal, let's see if we can finalize it.",918750.0,Alice,7,
