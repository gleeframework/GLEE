Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Realistic Expectation:** While $1,200,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's not outrageous. It's a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest without immediately resorting to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response.** If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly, but not too drastically, in the next round. 
* **Be prepared to counteroffer:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll analyze it and respond strategically.
* **Consider John as a backup:** If negotiations stall or if Bob's offers become too low, I'll be ready to accept John's offer to secure my minimum desired price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a starting point, $850,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's offer acknowledges the product's value and indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still room for a deal closer to my target price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer that is more appealing to me but still within the realm of a potential agreement. I might consider an offer in the $900,000 to $950,000 range.
* **Strategic Approach:** I'll continue to monitor Bob's willingness to compromise and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **John as a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail to yield a satisfactory result, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer to ensure I secure my minimum desired price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower but Still Profitable Price:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping my offer above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Highlighting Value and Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:** My message is friendly and positive, encouraging open communication and a potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or potentially explore other options.

* **Strategic Flexibility:** I'll remain flexible and adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and the evolving dynamics of the negotiation."
