"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a great starting point and I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's a good starting point, you have a lot of room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her value for the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within your budget.  By expressing willingness to negotiate, you show good faith and encourage a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit high. You have a better chance of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your target price and potentially reach a deal that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $750,000? I'm prepared to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further step towards your desired price while still being reasonable. You're showing you're serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway, but you're also firm in your price point. This approach should encourage Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product to you for $800500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your desired range, coming in just above your target.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  Considering you only have 5 rounds remaining, it's in your best interest to accept this offer. You can save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
