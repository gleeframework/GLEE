"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. Can you consider this?",12750.0,Bob,4,
