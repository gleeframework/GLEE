Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm starting high to explore the possibility of exceeding that.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The tone leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob counters, I can gauge his seriousness and potentially still secure a price significantly higher than my fallback offer from John.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
