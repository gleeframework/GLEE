,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115?  I'm really hoping to make this work.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $115 is getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work too, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's try $120.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me.",120.0,Bob,6,
