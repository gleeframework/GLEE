"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm looking to get $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion to signal I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While I want to sell the product, I need to ensure I'm getting at least my minimum value of $120. 
* **Negotiation is key.** I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation process. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Staying open:** I end with a question to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115?  I'm really hoping to make this work.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below my ideal price point.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can push closer to $120.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain some leverage and show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $115 is getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work too, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I reiterate the importance of getting a fair price for the product to justify the offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit of urgency by saying I'm hoping to ""make this deal work"" to encourage Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet in the middle, but $125 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's try $120.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No room for improvement:**  I have already reduced my price significantly and there's little room to negotiate further.  
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject this offer, I risk losing the sale to Bob and may have to sell to John at the same price. 
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further rejection could lead to a breakdown in negotiations.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure the sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
