Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point, ensuring you make a substantial profit even if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You are still below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate and potentially come to an agreement.
* **It mitigates risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

By offering $1,400,000, you maximize your chances of getting a better price while protecting yourself from a worst-case scenario."
