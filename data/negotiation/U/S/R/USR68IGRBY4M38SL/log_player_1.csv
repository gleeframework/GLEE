Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. 
* This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
*  It's also a significant enough amount to potentially incentivize Bob to accept the offer, especially if he values the product highly.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a higher price, I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest level and potentially trigger a negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still guaranteeing a minimum sale price."
