Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.  This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while leaving open the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. It's worth trying to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, showing you're still willing to negotiate, but it's also lower than your initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway. This approach keeps the negotiation moving and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close to your initial counteroffer, and it's a good compromise. It's a better price than selling to John, and it's a reasonable profit for you. Continuing the negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
