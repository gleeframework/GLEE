"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit you'll gain from it. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial proposal.  I could consider coming down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a more reasonable middle ground. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,025,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
