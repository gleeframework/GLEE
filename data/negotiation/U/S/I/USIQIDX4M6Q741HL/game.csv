"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $8,250? This would still leave me some room to make a profit, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today.",8000.0,Bob,4,
