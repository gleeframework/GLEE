"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Signaling that I'm open to negotiation makes the offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential interest for Bob creates a positive tone and sets the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000, so accepting his offer is not an option.
* **Selling to John is a good backup plan.**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not in a rush to make a deal with Bob at a lower price.
* **I have 8 rounds left to negotiate.**  There's still time to try and get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $8,250? This would still leave me some room to make a profit, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a margin:**  $8,250 is still above my minimum price of $8,000, so I'm not losing out financially. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price would benefit both of us, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum price.** I'm not going to get a better price from Bob, and I'm comfortable selling at this price. 
* **Time is a factor.** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **John is a good backup, but I don't want to waste time.** Since I'm satisfied with Bob's offer, it's not necessary to go to John. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a deal at my minimum price and avoid further negotiations."
