"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $7,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $8,250? This would still leave me some room to make a profit, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 8000}
