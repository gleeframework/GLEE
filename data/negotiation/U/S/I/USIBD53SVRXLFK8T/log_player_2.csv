{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $150, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it signals my seriousness in getting a lower price and sets the stage for negotiation.  Alice might counter with a higher price, but it's a good starting point to gauge her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I still want to try and get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still significantly below Alice's offer, hoping to push her towards a more reasonable price. With several rounds left, I believe there's still room to negotiate further."
