"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. While the product might be valuable, Bob should aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation process and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you think the product is worth, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at the bottom of Bob's acceptable range.**  $1,200,000 is within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation might not yield significant savings.** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price.**  Bob gets the product within his budget, and he avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
