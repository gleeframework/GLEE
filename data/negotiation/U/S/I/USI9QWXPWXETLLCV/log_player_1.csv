"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. It also leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price. Bob's offer is not attractive enough to accept right now, and I want to explore further negotiations. I believe I can potentially get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with a price of $18,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than my minimum.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is appealing to Bob while still getting a decent profit. If he's willing to negotiate, I believe this price will be more attractive than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $16,000, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $15,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and secures a sale.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and selling to John for $15,000 is a less attractive option."
