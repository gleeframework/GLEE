Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits of the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to explore this option further.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Although I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiations with Bob are taking too long, and I'm worried we won't reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and it's the best option at this point."
