"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I have to consider the value that this product brings to the table.

"Bob, I've been patient and willing to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to understand that this is my last offer. I'm willing to meet you at $970000. This is the absolute lowest price I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this product at this price point.",970000.0,Alice,9,
