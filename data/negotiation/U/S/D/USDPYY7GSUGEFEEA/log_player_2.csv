"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is your maximum price, there's no incentive to negotiate. You're guaranteed the same price from John, so it's best to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially losing out on the deal."
