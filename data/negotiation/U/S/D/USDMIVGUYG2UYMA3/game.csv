"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. I'm confident this price represents a great deal for you, given the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering both our positions. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, considering your own valuation of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to be closer to your desired price point, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would be a significant gain for you compared to selling to John, and a fair deal for me. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
