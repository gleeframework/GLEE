"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
