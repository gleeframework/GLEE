Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $13,000 for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I think the value I'm offering is worth the extra investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we make a deal at $11800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob has come up slightly in his offer, it's still not enough to reach my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John at this point to ensure I get my minimum price.  There's no guarantee that Bob will come up any higher, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
