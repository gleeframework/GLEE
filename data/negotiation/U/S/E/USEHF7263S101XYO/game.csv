"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still significantly less than the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $8250 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and your profit margin.",8250.0,Bob,4,
