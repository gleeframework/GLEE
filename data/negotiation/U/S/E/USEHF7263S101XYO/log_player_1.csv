Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to propose a price of $8500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $8250 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and your profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially ending up with less than my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, so that's the best choice."
