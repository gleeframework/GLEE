Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $6,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while I might be able to squeeze out another $100, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. $6,800 is a good price and a significant savings."
