"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I phrase it as a question to encourage Bob to engage in discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving space to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $750,000 for your product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal and not settling for less than what the product is worth.

By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Capitulation:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price but staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Re-Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm leaving the decision in Bob's hands but making it clear that I won't go much lower.

This strategy aims to inch closer to a deal while keeping the pressure on Bob to make a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. I am willing to pay $825,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject his offer, further negotiation might result in a lower price, or Bob might walk away. 
* **Time Factor:** We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Bob altogether.

While I would ideally prefer a price closer to $900,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and provides a profit margin close to my expectations."
