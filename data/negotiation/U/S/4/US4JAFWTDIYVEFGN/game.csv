"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $825000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $850000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",850000.0,Alice,5,
