"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below my valuation for this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
