"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit. This is a risky move, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. I'm keeping in mind the $8,000 fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe Bob is willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price, considering my minimum of $8,000. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not sure it's the best I can get. I'll counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm now offering $8,500, which is a more significant compromise. I believe this price is within the acceptable range for both of us. It's above my minimum, but still lower than Bob's previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price.  While I would love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale. I will accept his offer and close the deal."
