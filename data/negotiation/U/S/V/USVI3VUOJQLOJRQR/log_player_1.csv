Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, you can adjust your strategy accordingly.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can be firmer in your negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value.  While selling to John for $100 is an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):** This counter-offer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss. Moving closer to $100 signals flexibility while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to you.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We know Bob values the product at $100, so there's still a good chance he'll be willing to pay slightly more than that. 
* **John as a Back-Up:**  We haven't forgotten about John! If Bob continues to lowball, we can always walk away and take the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from the middle, how about we try $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering your minimum acceptable price, which is also his perceived value of the product. It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale altogether."
