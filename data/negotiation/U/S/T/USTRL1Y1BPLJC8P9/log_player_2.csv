"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for $14,000. I believe it will be very beneficial for you and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 represents a fair price for its value, I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,500.  This allows me to meet you halfway while still reflecting the worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his target price, it's still more than his preferred $13,000.  There's still a chance to negotiate further, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500. I'd be willing to go up to $13,250.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
