Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your position, I need to maintain a certain price point to ensure profitability. I am willing to consider a middle ground at $7,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer of $7,000 is close to John's price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit further. We're in no rush."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $6,000? That would be a great deal for me and still give you a decent profit."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad we're narrowing down the price range. To further accommodate your needs while maintaining a reasonable profit margin, I propose a final offer of $6,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $1,500 less than John.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and it's a good deal for us."
