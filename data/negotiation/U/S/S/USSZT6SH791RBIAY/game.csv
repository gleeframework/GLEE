,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $110?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $125. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm eager to get this product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $127. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
