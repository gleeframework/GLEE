Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for [Insert price here].  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and open-ended. This is designed to pique Bob's interest without giving away too much information about the product's value to me.
* **Product Price:** I've set the price at $180, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

This strategy is a balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk.  Here's why:

* **Higher Price:**  Starting with a higher price gives me more room to negotiate if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy requires careful consideration of Bob's potential interest. If you have any additional information about Bob's likely willingness to pay, you can adjust the price accordingly."
