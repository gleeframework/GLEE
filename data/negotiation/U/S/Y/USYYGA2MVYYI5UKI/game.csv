"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to sell the product to you for that price.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to sell the product to you for that price.",90.0,Alice,5,
