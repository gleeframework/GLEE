"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This allows me to potentially negotiate down while still securing a good profit.  It also sets the tone that I believe this product is valuable.  

**Key Factors to Consider:**

* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  I don't know Bob's perception of the product's worth, so a high initial offer could make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I want to create urgency and avoid a long, drawn-out negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob is willing to engage.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's willingness to make an offer, even if low, indicates he values the product.
* **Limited Rounds:** I still have eight rounds to explore a better deal.  Selling to John right now feels premature.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap and leads to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for further discussion.  I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my desired profit while still potentially being attractive to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price is midway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  It's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good return.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true interest and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** This price is only $100,000 below my initial asking price and a significant improvement over John's offer. It's a good profit margin and a solid outcome.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I'm halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. This offer ensures a sale and a substantial profit."
