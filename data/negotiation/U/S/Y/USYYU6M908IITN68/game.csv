"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. How about we discuss $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe we might be able to find common ground at a price that suits both of us better. How about considering $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're having a productive conversation, Bob! However, $1050000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1150000? I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think we can find a price that works for both of us without compromising too much. How about considering $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $1100000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1200000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept? If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
