# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is a better offer than $18,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can go."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob has reached his limit. While $11,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his budget.  At this point, it's better to buy from John and save $3,500."
