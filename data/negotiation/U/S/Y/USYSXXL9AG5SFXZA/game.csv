,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
