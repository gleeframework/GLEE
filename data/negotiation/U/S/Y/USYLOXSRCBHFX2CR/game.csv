"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $15000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $12000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12500. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $11500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
