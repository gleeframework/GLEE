"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
