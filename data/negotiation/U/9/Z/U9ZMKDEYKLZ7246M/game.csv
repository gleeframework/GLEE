"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my target profit margin.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget simply won't allow me to go over $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $13,000, which would be $14,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and my target profit margin.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your coming down, $14,500 is still pushing my budget. I'm feeling a lot of pressure to buy, but I really can't go above $13,500.  I know you want to make a good profit, but I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle here.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $14,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest counteroffer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",14000.0,Alice,7,
