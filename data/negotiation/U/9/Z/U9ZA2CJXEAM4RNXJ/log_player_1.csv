Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll value."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Psychology:** A strong opening offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading to a higher final sale price. 
 
**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes some flexibility in Bob's budget and a willingness to negotiate.
* If Alice knows more about Bob's financial situation or negotiating style, the offer price might be adjusted."
