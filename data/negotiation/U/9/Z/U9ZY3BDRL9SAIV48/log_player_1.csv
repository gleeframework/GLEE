Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) can influence his perception of the product's value and create room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I aim high, the offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the conversation open and allows me to potentially secure a price higher than my minimum.
* **Confident presentation:** The language used emphasizes the product's value and benefits, aiming to justify the higher price and create a sense of desirability.

**Important Note:**  I am aware I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. This strategy aims to maximize profit, understanding there's a risk Bob might reject the offer."
