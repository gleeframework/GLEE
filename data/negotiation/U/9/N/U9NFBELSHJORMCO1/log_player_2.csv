Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value you place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop to $750,000 for the product, which is a compromise on my end. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still well above your initial offer.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

At this point, Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $750,000.  Since you can buy the product for $800,000 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
