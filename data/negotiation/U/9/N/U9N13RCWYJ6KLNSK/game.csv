"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also being reasonable for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to accept $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some more, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",795000.0,Alice,5,
