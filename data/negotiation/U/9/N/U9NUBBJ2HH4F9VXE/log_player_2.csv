**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high. It's within your budget, but you're aiming to save as much as possible. There's room to negotiate, and you should try to get a lower price."

While $900,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target price. I'm aiming to get a price closer to $850,000. There's still room to negotiate, and I should try to get a lower price before considering buying from John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is getting closer to my target price of $850,000. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it."
