Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum price of $80. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price and I believe I can push for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $95 and his offer of $85. I believe this price is fair and a good starting point for further negotiations. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as the negotiation is getting close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is close enough to my minimum price of $80 and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, he might walk away and I'll be left with John's offer of $80.  It's a better deal than John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
