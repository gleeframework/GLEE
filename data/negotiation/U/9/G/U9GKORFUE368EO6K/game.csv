"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still confident in the value of my product and I'd like to counter with $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure it's a price that you'll find appealing.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I can only go up to that price. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we meet at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
