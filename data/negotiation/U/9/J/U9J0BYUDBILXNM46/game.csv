"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $10,750.  This is closer to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,875?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10875.0,Alice,5,
