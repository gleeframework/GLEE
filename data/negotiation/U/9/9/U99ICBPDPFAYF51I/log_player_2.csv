Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

This is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's latest offer, potentially leading her to consider it. This might be a good bargaining point as Alice might accept your offer to avoid further rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is too close to John's price of $150, and we are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a high chance that Alice will not agree to a price lower than $140.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point to ensure you get the product without risking further rounds of negotiation."
