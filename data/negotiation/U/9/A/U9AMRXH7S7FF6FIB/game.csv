"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any lower.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
