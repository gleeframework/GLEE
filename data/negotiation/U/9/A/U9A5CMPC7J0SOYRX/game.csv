"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and it's in excellent condition. I'm asking for $12,000 to start. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $7,000?  I think that would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $7,000 is closer to a fair deal. To show I'm flexible, how about we settle on $8,500?  That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
