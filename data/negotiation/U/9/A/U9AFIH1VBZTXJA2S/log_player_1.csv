Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, making it likely he'll consider the offer and potentially counter. 
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving the product away, but you're also not being overly aggressive.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible while still making a sale. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer moves the price up from Bob's offer while still being below your initial offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $875,000 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This would be a great price for you and a fair deal for me. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's last offer ($875,000) and your previous offer ($900,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the compromise you're making. It also re-iterates the value of the product for Bob.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to your desired price while showing flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below your previous counteroffer, it is a significant improvement compared to John's offer. It is also very close to your ideal price, which suggests you might not be able to get a better deal.  

* **Accepting the offer:** You are getting a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price or even no deal.

Considering the risk of a stalemate with Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price, accepting this offer is the best option to maximize your earnings."
