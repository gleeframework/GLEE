Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 offers a significant saving for Bob compared to his perceived value, making it a compelling offer he's likely to accept. 
* **Alternative Secured:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed a sale at my minimum acceptable price with John."
