"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
