"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially save more by counter-offering and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's likely that Alice will counter with a price closer to $1,100,000, which would still be within your budget. If she rejects this offer, you can then choose to either make another counteroffer or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially increasing the price means it's better to secure the deal at this point. You're saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
