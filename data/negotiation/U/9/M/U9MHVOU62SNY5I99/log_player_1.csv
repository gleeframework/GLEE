Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but significantly below my minimum. It starts the negotiation at a point that might encourage Bob to accept, while still leaving room for negotiation if he rejects. It also leaves room for me to make a new offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you consider $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my goal of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $128. How about we split the difference? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has gotten closer to my desired price, it's still not at my minimum.  Considering the potential for further negotiation and the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer, it's safer to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
