"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially setting the price at $22,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your product, $22,000 is far outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This price reflects a compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  It's a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to sell. Let's work towards a solution.",15000.0,Bob,4,
