Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a desirable range, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're not in a desperate situation to sell immediately, so we can afford to counter his offer again."

Round 5

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly jumped down in his offer, indicating he might be getting less willing to negotiate further.  We are getting closer to a point where accepting his offer might be better than risking him walking away, but we can still push a bit further by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to assure you that I'm committed to finding a fair agreement. Let's make this simple: $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're introducing a sense of urgency by presenting this as our final offer. This aims to encourage Bob to make a decision and potentially accept a price slightly higher than his last offer without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging much, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting his offer of $1,125,000 is significantly better than John's standing offer of $800,000. It's time to secure a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
