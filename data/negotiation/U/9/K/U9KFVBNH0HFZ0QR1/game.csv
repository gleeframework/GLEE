"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
