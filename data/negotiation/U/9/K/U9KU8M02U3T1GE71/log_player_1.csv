{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This offer is significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000), ensuring I maximize my potential earnings.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase my chances of securing a price closer to Bob's valuation while still having the safety net of John's offer."
