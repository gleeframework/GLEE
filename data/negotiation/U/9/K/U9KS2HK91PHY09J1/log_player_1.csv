Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal,  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob or sell to John as a backup."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is still quite far from my minimum valuation.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is still too far below my minimum. While John is a safe option at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can achieve a better outcome."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,075,000 is closer than previous offers, it's still significantly below my minimum. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap and secure a deal closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm running out of time and need to secure the best possible deal.  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and meets my minimum valuation.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
