Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's unlikely he'll reach $8,000.  You have a guaranteed sale with John at your minimum, so it's time to cut your losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
