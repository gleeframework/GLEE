Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high ($200+) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer.  $150 is a significant markup but still within a potentially acceptable range if Bob values the product.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher than the asking price, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale with John at our minimum acceptable price."
