"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,10500.0
"I understand you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you consider this price?",10200.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10200 to $11000, but I can do a bit better than that. I'll make a final offer of $10800. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10800.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $12000. I'm confident that the product is worth this amount to you, and I'm willing to hold firm on the price.
