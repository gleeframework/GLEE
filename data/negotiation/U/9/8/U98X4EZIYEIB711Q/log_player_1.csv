Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it will be very beneficial to you, and this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range favorable to Alice.
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  Alice has a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Why not ask for the full $15,000?**

While ideal, it's risky. Bob might perceive it as too aggressive and walk away, even if the product is worth that much to him. A slightly lower offer increases the chance of a successful sale."
