"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think you'll be happy with the deal! If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, allowing you to save even more money."
