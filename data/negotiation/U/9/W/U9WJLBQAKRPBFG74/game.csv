"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $825,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
