"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make you a great deal. Would you be interested in buying it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a lower price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  He can get the product for $80 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice."
