"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still offers you a significant profit margin.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's below Alice's value, it's above Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John. There's still room for Alice to come down in price, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $950000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
