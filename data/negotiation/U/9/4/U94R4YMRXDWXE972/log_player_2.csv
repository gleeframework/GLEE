"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make it a deal you can't refuse. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further in price.
* You have John as a backup who will sell it to you at your maximum budget, so there's no risk of losing the product entirely."
