Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm framing it positively to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I want to encourage Bob to counteroffer so we can find a price that works for both of us.  
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me leverage if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **I have a better option:**  I can sell to John for $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  

I will counter with a price that is higher than $120 but lower than my initial offer. This approach keeps the negotiation open while still protecting my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $145?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Reframing the Value:** I'm emphasizing the deal's value for Bob, highlighting the product's quality and appealing to his interests.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $145. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is willing to make a commitment, the price of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150.  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a longer process and potentially a lower final price. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John now is the most efficient and profitable option. I can secure the highest value and avoid the uncertainty of additional rounds of negotiation.

I'm choosing to prioritize certainty and maximizing my profit by accepting John's offer."
