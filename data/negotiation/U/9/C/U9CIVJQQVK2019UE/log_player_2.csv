"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,000.**  This is a good price for Bob because it's within his budget of $15,000 and saves him $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting the offer could lead to more negotiation rounds.**  While there's a chance of getting an even lower price, it could also lead to Alice getting stubborn and not lowering the price further.
* **Buying from John would cost more.** John's offer is for $15,000, which is more expensive than Alice's current offer. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows Bob to get the product for a price within his budget and saves him money compared to buying from John."
