"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to Alice while still saving Bob some money. It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target price of $13,000.  While it's closer to his ideal price than John's offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer to $13,500. This is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still willing to negotiate.  This price is closer to Alice's last offer, making it more likely she'll accept. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. It's no longer beneficial for Bob to continue negotiating as he won't be able to get a better price from Alice. At this point, it's the same price as John's offer, so Bob might as well buy from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price with Alice, and there's a risk of Alice walking away completely."
