"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum of $10,000.  Bob can potentially still negotiate a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  There's also the option of buying from John if he can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  Offering $11,000 shows he's willing to compromise, but it's still within his budget and leaves room for Alice to accept.  The mention of John serves as a reminder to Alice that Bob has other options, increasing the pressure to reach an agreement."
