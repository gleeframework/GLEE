"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
