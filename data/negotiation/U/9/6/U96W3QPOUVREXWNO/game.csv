"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
