"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $12000 is significantly lower than what it's worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $13500? That's a good compromise, and it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $12500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm always open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - how about $13000?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll still be getting a great value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not sure $13000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $13000, so how about $12750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
