Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
 ""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the high price (""Given its value..."") to anchor the negotiation around the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob's feedback (""What are your thoughts?"") to signal my willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is decent, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I know he values the product at $1,000,000, so I'll try to meet him closer to the middle. Selling to John for $800,000 is my fallback option, but I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you."",
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $900,000 positions the deal as a win-win. Bob gets a discount, and I still make a significant profit over my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a good deal for himself, but his offer of $875,000 is now getting close to a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $875,000 is still a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only yield small increments, and there's a risk that Bob could walk away or become less willing to compromise.
* **John as a Back-Up:** While I could sell to John for $800,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher profit now.

It's always tempting to try and squeeze out every last dollar, but in this case, accepting a strong offer like this is the most rational decision."
