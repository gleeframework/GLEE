"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'm confident that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he might be willing to negotiate. I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm confident in the value of the product and feel there's room for a more favorable deal.  I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially continue negotiations to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal.  I'll keep a close eye on the situation and be prepared to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will only result in a lower price.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum requirement, so selling to him now is the most sensible option."
