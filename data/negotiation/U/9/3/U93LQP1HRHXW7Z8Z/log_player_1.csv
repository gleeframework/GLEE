"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:** A $140 offer leaves some room for me to potentially drop the price if Bob counteroffers. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for further negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob continue to fall short.
* **Future Rounds:** I'll use the next round to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a good offer, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $140 to $135, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Shared Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as finding a price that works for both of us, emphasizing cooperation.
* **Room for One More Move:**  $135 leaves a little more room to potentially lower the price if Bob is still hesitant.
* **John's Offer as Anchor:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a reminder that I have a good backup if we can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise, meeting us almost halfway.
* **Close to Target:**  $130 is only $10 below my initial asking price and significantly closer to my desired value than his initial offer.
* **Time is Limited:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** While John's offer is tempting, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and keeps the negotiation process open for future potential deals with Bob."
