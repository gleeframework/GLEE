"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting the offer at $15,000 gains him nothing.  By rejecting, he can attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying since he can always buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes his willingness to negotiate and potentially forces Alice to reveal her minimum acceptable price. If Alice rejects, Bob has several more rounds to adjust his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial price, but it's still above Bob's target.  He's already established a willingness to negotiate and has several more rounds to potentially get a better price. There's no point in buying from John at $15,000 when Alice is showing some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This demonstrates his commitment to negotiating while also showing that he's willing to compromise.  The goal is to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still close to his target price and has several rounds left to negotiate.  Alice is showing flexibility, but it's still worth trying to push for a lower price.  While buying from John at $15,000 is an option, Bob is getting closer to his goal with Alice, and there's no harm in trying to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is closing in on his target price and has shown his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a modest increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  With only four rounds remaining, it's time to start closing the deal, but still holding out for a price below $12,500."
