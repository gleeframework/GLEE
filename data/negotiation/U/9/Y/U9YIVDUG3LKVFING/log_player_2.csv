# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now matching John's price, so there's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John.  Take the deal!"
