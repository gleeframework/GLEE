Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,100,000 to $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I hope we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. This is my highest offer within my budget constraints, and I hope it is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether. It's better to secure a sale at a price that's reasonable and within my acceptable range."
