"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
