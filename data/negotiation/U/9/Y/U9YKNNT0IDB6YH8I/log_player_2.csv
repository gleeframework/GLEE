**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While it's possible further negotiation *might* get the price lower, it's risky. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving $50,000. At this point, the potential savings with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her refusing any further offers."
