# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum value, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price of $1,000,000. I am willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There's always a chance Alice might be more willing to compromise if she feels the deal is at risk of falling through."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $1,140,000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,140,000 is still above my maximum value.  I'm confident that I can get the product for my target price of $1,000,000 by going with John.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and I don't want to risk losing out on a deal that meets my budget."
