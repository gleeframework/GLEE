"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to offer $15,500.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $15,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,750. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $16,000. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16250.0,Alice,5,
