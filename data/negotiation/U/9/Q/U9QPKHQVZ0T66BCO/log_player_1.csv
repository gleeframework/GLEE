"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Confident Justification:**  While the price is high, framing it as a ""valuable product"" and a ""worthwhile investment"" can help justify the initial ask. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, indicating you're willing to negotiate. 

By starting high, we can gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. Accepting $750,000 would be leaving money on the table. We'll counter in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $750,000 is lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We want to keep the negotiation collaborative and show that we are considering his perspective.
* **Conceding, But Firm:**  We're coming down from our initial high price, but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's offer and our minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $900,000 positions our offer as a potential compromise. This gives Bob room to negotiate further while signaling that we're serious about a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $820,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price and provides a $20,000 profit. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
