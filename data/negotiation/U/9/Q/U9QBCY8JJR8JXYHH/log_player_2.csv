"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $100, which is the same price John is offering, you might as well accept Alice's offer. There is no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John."
