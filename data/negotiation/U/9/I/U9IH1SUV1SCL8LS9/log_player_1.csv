Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob,  it hints at it with the phrase ""given its value."" This subtly implies the price is justified without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $15,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still negotiate down to a price above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer, so you can afford to be a little more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
