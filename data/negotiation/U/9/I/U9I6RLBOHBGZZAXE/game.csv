"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a discussion. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand from my end. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and quality.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
