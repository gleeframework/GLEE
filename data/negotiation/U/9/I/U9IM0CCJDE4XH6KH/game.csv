"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, however, $1,600,000 represents a significant discount from what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,400,000.  This reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that price is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $900,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a price of $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
