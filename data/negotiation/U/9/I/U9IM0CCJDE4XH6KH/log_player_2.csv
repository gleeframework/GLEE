Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, however, $1,600,000 represents a significant discount from what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,400,000.  This reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $900,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a price of $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is digging in and unlikely to drop below $1,150,000. While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer.""  You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000, which saves you at least $150,000."
