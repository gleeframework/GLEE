Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000.

**The Risk:** If Alice asks for too much, Bob will reject the offer, and she'll get her baseline price from John.

**The Strategy:**  Alice should propose a price that's significantly higher than $12,000, but not so high that Bob would never consider it. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of securing a higher profit.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Polite and Professional:** The message maintains a positive and business-like tone.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The phrase ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **""Starting Price"":**  This implies Alice is open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $18,000 is a significant markup but not entirely unreasonable, given Alice's goal to maximize profit.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, leading to further negotiation."
