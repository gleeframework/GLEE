{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but $1,200,000 is still a significant amount. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to avoid paying that much if possible."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You've already established a lower price point, and there's potential for compromise.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You're committed to getting the best deal possible."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.** While still above your ideal price point, it's within a reasonable range, and you're making progress.
* **There's a risk of going back and forth.**  You're already in Round 5, and you don't want to risk Alice getting frustrated or changing her mind.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You're committed to getting the best deal possible from Alice. 

By accepting, you secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than buying from John, while also acknowledging the progress made in the negotiation."
