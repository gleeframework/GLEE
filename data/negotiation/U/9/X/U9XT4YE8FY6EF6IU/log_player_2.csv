"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value ($150).** You can potentially save money by negotiating.
* **There's a chance to get a better deal from Alice.** While John is willing to sell for $150, there's still room for negotiation with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $125. Would that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price ($150).** 
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You can try to bring the price down closer to your target by making another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** While $150 is your maximum, you're not yet at that point and can try to get a better deal."
