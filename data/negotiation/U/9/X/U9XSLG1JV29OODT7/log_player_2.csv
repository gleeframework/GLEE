# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for a product worth $12000 to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a good price for a product worth $12000 to me, and hopefully a good value for you too. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. It seems like Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance I can get a better deal."

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $11,000.  While it's a good price for the product, it's still above my budget.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
