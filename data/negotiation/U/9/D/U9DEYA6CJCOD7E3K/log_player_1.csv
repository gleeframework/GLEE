Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Motivation:** This price offers a decent profit margin for me while also being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have room to lower the price, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum of $150.  
* **Alternative:** The option to sell to John for $150 gives me a strong bargaining position, allowing me to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, $90 is still significantly below my minimum price of $150 and far below the initial offer I made.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I can still negotiate a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can propose a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **Alternative Still Available:** The option to sell to John for $150 gives me the upper hand in this negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is unfortunately not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **Meeting Halfway:** $105 represents a compromise between my initial offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Reiteration of Value:** I emphasize that this price is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the potential value of the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open while still positioning me to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price, especially considering my alternative option of selling to John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. It also reinforces my position of not being desperate to sell at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. $100 is a bit closer, but I still need to make a profit.  How about $110?  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this offer my ""final offer"" to create urgency and pressure Bob into accepting.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm only increasing the offer slightly from $105 to $110, showing I'm willing to compromise but not for too little.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm reminding Bob of my alternative option (selling to John), emphasizing that I don't need to accept his offer.
* **Negotiation End:** This is my last counteroffer; if Bob rejects, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer waiting, but I'm not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you reconsider and meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Negotiation:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go above $100, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  
* **Alternative is Better:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a significantly better profit than selling to Bob for $100.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would waste time and potentially lead to a lower price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting my final offer and walking away.

By selling to John, I ensure the highest possible profit and avoid further negotiation."
