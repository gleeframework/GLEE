Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,450,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000, ensuring you meet your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a degree of realism."
