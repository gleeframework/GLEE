You can do better than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

While $9,500 is better than John's price, you can still do better.  You have room to negotiate further with Alice.  Let's see if we can get a bit closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't come to an agreement, I might have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is now offering $10,000, which is close to your limit, but you can still do better by going to John. You only have a $2,000 difference to save."
