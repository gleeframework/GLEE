# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial asking price, you can still do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,250,000 is a good price point,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise, and it's worth accepting.  You're getting a good deal, and it's likely you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice. Buying from John would be cheaper, but the risk of losing the deal with Alice is not worth it."
