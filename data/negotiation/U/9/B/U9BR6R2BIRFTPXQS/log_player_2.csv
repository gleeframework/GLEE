"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're extending an exclusive opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $100. This offer is tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive the best value. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than the product's worth to her ($120), it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and what John offers. You can save $20 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
