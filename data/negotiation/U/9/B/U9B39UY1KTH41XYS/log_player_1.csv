Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $85 is significantly below my minimum value for the product.  I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $110 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $95 is still below my minimum value, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now, but I'm also aware of the alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer,  I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $105 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $98.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum value.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident I'll get a fair price from him.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the opportunity with Bob."
