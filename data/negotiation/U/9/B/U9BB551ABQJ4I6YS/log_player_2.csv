"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is $900,000. There's room for negotiation.  You should counteroffer to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value you placed on it yourself, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $850,000 is still too high. You can still get a better deal. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so a counteroffer will likely be accepted by Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still interested but  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I offer you $825,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  You are still able to get a better price, as you are willing to pay more than what she is asking.  The counteroffer should be closer to your target price, but still acceptable to Alice."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a little, but she seems firm on $900,000.  At this point, it is likely a better deal to accept her offer.   You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and her offer is $900,000, which is a better price than buying from John for $1,200,000.  It is a good deal for you and likely for Alice since she is only selling it for $800,000."
