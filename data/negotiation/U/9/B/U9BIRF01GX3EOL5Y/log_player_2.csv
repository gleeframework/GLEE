# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $100 to us, but considering your interest, I'm willing to extend a special offer. Would you like to purchase the product for $120? This price reflects its true value while providing you with an excellent deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can go with your guaranteed option of buying from John."
