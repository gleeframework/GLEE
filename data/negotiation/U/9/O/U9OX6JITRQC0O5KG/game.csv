,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit more reasonable given the market value.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than your offer. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly to $19,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for the value you're getting.",19000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value of this product. $17,000 is too low for what it offers. I'm willing to make one last concession at $18,500.  This is my absolute bottom line.",18500.0,Alice,7,
