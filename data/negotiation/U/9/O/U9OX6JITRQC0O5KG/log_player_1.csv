**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet a price point that reflects the product's value to me.  At this point, it's clear he's trying to get a deal that's significantly below my minimum.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing John's guaranteed offer."
