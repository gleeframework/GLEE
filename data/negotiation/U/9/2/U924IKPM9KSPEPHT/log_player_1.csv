Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, remember your bottom line is $1,200,000 (John's offer)."
