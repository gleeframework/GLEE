Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob has incentive to accept to secure the product. 
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not just throwing out a lowball offer, but are willing to negotiate.

Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but you also need to be mindful of Bob's willingness to pay. We'll adjust our strategy based on his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than what you're aiming for. You want to maximize your profits, and you're confident that you can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

**Here's the strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer** shows Bob that you're not desperate for a quick sale and that you're willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Continuing to negotiate** gives you a chance to counter with a higher offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Selling to John** is a backup option, but it's not ideal since you'll be leaving money on the table. 

In the next round, you'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to your original price, but still within the realm of what Bob might be willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for a good profit for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  This shows you're serious about getting a good price and you're not willing to settle for a low offer. 
* **Show flexibility:** You're offering a compromise by lowering your original price, but not going too far down. This encourages Bob to reciprocate and meet in the middle.
* **Emphasize shared benefit:**  By mentioning a ""good profit for both of us"", you're framing the negotiation as a win-win situation.  

This counteroffer is a strategic move that balances the need to get a good price with the need to keep the negotiation moving. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While it's tempting to try and push for a higher price,  $875,000 is a good compromise. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:**  You're getting close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring you still make a decent profit.
* **Bob's final offer:**  It seems like Bob is firm on his offer, and pushing further might risk losing him as a buyer.
* **Time and risk:**  Continued negotiations could drag on, and there's always the risk that Bob will walk away or find a better deal elsewhere.

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a sale quickly and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.  It's a wise move that balances potential profits with the realities of the situation."
