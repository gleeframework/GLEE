Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to invite Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest. 

This approach allows me to potentially get a higher price while also leaving room for compromise. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 threshold I set for myself. 
* **Opportunity for More:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $100 would be a loss compared to a potential higher price from Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, aiming to negotiate a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $125 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on that - let's try $127.50. This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming to get a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:**  I'm highlighting the benefit of this price to both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Avoiding Extreme Counteroffers:** This counteroffer isn't too far off from Bob's, keeping the negotiation moving forward without risking him walking away.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, allowing me to achieve a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $127.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $122.50 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my initial goal, it is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer again, there's a risk he'll walk away completely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $22.50, which is more than I'd make selling to John.

Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $122.50. It's the best outcome considering the potential for a stalemate if I reject again."
