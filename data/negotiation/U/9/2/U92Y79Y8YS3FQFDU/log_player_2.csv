"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be of great value to you.  Given its unique capabilities and potential, I'm asking for $1400000.  Let's start our negotiation here and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the offer gives Bob more time to potentially reach a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make this deal work, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a reasonable middle ground.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution that works for us.  While I appreciate your offer, $1250000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1275000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. While there are still rounds left, accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is significantly lower than John's offer and within his budget.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only result in a small price decrease, making this offer a good deal for Bob."
