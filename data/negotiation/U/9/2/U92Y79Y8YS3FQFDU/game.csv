"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be of great value to you.  Given its unique capabilities and potential, I'm asking for $1400000.  Let's start our negotiation here and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make this deal work, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a reasonable middle ground.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution that works for us.  While I appreciate your offer, $1250000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1275000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
