Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial high offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and potential budget. His response will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates the price down, you have a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than your baseline of $800,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Be prepared to justify the high price by highlighting the unique value and benefits the product offers to Bob specifically.
* **Negotiation:** Be open to negotiating the price, but stand firm on your minimum acceptable price (which should be comfortably above $800,000).
* **Alternative buyer (John):** Remember, you have a safety net with John, so don't feel pressured to accept any offer below your desired threshold."
