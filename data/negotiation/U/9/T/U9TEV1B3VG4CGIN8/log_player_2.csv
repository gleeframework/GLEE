{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget but still leaves room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum value. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further while still leaving me room to increase my offer if needed."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my ideal price, I want to see if I can get it even lower. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a better price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  This is a more reasonable counteroffer, but still leaves me with a significant savings compared to Alice's last offer and John's price.  Hopefully, this will incentivize Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but I'm getting closer to a deal. It's still too early to buy from John, as I have a good chance of negotiating a lower price with Alice. I will continue to counter offer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. This should be close enough to her price that she will consider accepting it, while still allowing me to save a significant amount compared to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.  We are nearing the middle ground, and a few more rounds of counteroffers could get us to a mutually acceptable price.  I don't want to rush into a purchase before exploring all options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer one more time, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  This is a significant offer, close to Alice's last offer, but still leaves me with a reasonable savings. It's a high-risk, high-reward move, but I believe it will either push Alice to accept or force her to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. I am running out of rounds, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer is still above my target price. I've made significant counteroffers, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but Alice is not budging.  At this point, it's better to buy from John, as his price guarantees me the product and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice in the last round. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
