"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to his ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not quite comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  Bob's target price is $12,000 or less. 
* **Alice's value:** Alice wants to sell for at least $8,000. 
* **Current offer:** Alice's offer is $9,000.

Accepting the offer of $9,000 saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might refuse future offers, leading to a scenario where Bob has to buy from John at a higher price."
