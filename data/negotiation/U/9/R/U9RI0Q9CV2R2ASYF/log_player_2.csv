# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see it in your capable hands.
