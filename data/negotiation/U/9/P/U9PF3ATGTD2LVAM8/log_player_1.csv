"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's value to me, hoping to get a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still higher than my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm now willing to meet Bob's valuation of the product. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. John is offering my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not willing to risk further rounds of negotiation."
