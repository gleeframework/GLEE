Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal he might find appealing."
