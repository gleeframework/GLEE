Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The tone of the message aims to convey the product's value and my confidence in the price without seeming overly aggressive. 

By starting at $14,000, I have a strong chance of:

1. **Bob accepting immediately:**  He gets the product for less than his perceived value.
2. **Negotiation:** We potentially settle on a price between $13,000 - $14,000, which is still highly profitable for me. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward, giving me the best chance of maximizing my profit from selling the product."
