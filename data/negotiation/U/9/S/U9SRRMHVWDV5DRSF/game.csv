"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen to purchase the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high, but I was thinking more in the range of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Could you consider $13,500? That's a significant move on my part, demonstrating my serious interest in purchasing the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll meet you at $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement on price. How about we settle at $14,000? It's a win-win - you get a fair price, and I get the product.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,250, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,7,
