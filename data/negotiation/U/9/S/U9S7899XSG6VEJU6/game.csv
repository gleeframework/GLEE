"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $680,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",680000.0,Alice,5,
