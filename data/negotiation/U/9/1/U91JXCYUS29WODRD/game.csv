"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  While $1,000,000 is a fair starting point, I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true worth.  Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant advantage and allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it's the closest I can come to your offer while still ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However,  $1,050,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to drop to $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and it's a substantial compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1060000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
