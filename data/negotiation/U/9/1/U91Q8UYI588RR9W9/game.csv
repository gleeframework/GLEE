"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm happy to compromise and come down to $1050000.  This reflects the value I believe this product brings to your business, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
