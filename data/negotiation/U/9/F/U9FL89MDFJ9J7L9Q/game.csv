"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $135? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $165? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $150. This feels like a reasonable compromise, and I'm sure we can make this deal happen.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $155? It's a slight compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $152.50. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $152.50, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about I throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10? That way, you'll be getting an even better deal than you thought. In that case, I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $162.50.",162.5,Alice,7,
