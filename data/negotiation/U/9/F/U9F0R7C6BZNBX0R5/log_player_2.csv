# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget limitations.  While $800,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is still below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal if you're open to it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good compromise, but it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While there's a chance we could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely. I've already established a reliable alternative with John at $800,000. It's time to secure the deal and avoid further potential delays or complications."
