"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $9500? This would give us both a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and a good deal for him. 
* **Progress:**  Alice has already moved from her initial $10,000 offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll have to pay more. 
* **Time:**  With only 7 rounds left, it's important to close the deal."
