"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming high to see how he reacts. I'll be prepared to adjust my offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but also making sure I get a price that's worth my time and effort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would like to get closer to $950,000,  $920,000 is a good price, and we're already in round 4.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher offer. It's important to weigh the potential for a better deal against the risk of losing the sale altogether."
