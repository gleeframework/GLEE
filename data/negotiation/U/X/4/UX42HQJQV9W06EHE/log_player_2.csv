"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice is happy to sell for $800,000.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a last resort, so it's best to try to negotiate further with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still too high. You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice is willing to come down.  Rejecting this offer and counter-offering again gives you a better chance of getting a price you're happy with. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a last resort."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. I'm willing to meet you at $885000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is very close to your last offer of $875,000.  It's worth accepting this offer.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate and reached a price that's significantly lower than your initial maximum.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only waste time and potentially risk Alice walking away.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a less desirable option."
