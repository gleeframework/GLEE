"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my target price of $95.  Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but he seems interested. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm happy to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $87.50 is still a bit too low. I want to see if I can get Bob up to $90. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $90. Would you be willing to go up to $89? It's a small step for you, and it would mean a lot to me."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $89, which would be $88.25. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than my target price, it's getting close, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  I'm also running out of rounds, and I need to make a decision soon."
