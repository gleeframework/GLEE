"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That's my absolute max.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I really think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
