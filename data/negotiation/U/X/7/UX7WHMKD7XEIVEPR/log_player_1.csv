"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly above what you offered, but it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a good compromise, considering we're both looking for a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $900,000 is still too low.  However, I'm getting a sense that he's willing to negotiate further.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  This price still offers you a good deal, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John.  I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a successful outcome.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
