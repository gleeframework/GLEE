"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise and allows you to make a decent profit. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
