"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. I'm hoping this initial high offer will encourage Bob to engage seriously in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that amount just yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, it's still a good price for me, and I believe Bob might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher amount. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,350,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good price for me. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and a fair compromise. I'm also running out of time, and the risk of reaching the end of the negotiation without a deal is high.  It's better to accept Bob's offer now and secure the sale."
