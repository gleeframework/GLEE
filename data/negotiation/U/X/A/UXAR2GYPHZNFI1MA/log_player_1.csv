{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing my minimum is $80. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $60 is significantly lower than my minimum of $80. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's value. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This price is closer to my desired range and leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $72? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $72 is still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $80, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $72 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this valuable product. How about $78? That's a compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 78}
```

I'm offering $78, which is a compromise on my part.  I'm hoping this price is appealing enough for Bob to accept. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that it's closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72 and $78. How about $75? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and a better deal than selling to John for $80.  I'm satisfied with this outcome, considering the back-and-forth negotiation."
