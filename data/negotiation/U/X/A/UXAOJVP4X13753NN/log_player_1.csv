"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to establish a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can secure a better price with Bob or John.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while also allowing me to maintain a fair return.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to convince him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value it holds for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, this deal ensures I meet my financial goal.  It's also a good strategy to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
