"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, he can potentially get a better price by negotiating further.  He has nothing to lose by trying to get a lower price from Alice, as he can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal. While Bob could potentially negotiate further and try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at $1,200,000. It's more strategic for Bob to accept this offer and save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
