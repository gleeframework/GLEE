"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $85 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her valuation and leaves room for you to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down a bit, the price is still above your target. There's space to negotiate further.
* **John as Backup:** You have the option to buy from John for $120, so you don't need to feel pressured to accept an offer above your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($95) and your previous offer ($85). 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** It shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Time Consideration:** As the negotiation continues, it might be wise to incrementally increase your offer to avoid reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at the higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I think I can do a bit better than $90. I'll offer you the product for $92. It's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $92 is a reasonable price, saving you $28 compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Alice. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal.
* **Time Value:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
