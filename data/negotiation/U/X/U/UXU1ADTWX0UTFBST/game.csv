"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $1,325,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,362,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1362500.0,Alice,5,
