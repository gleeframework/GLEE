Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we settle on $1,400,000?
