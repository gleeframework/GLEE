{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** This signals flexibility and makes Bob more likely to engage in a discussion. 

This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for potential negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, based on my research and budget, I am only able to offer $14500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to risk a little bit to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see you're genuinely interested.  However, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to cover my costs.  How about $14,750?  I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counter offer is a compromise, slightly higher than Bob's offer but still less than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** I use positive language to maintain a good relationship with Bob. This is important for ensuring a successful negotiation.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, my budget constraints prevent me from going above $14600. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and the potential of further negotiation is uncertain.  Given the risk of going back and forth further and potentially losing Bob altogether, accepting his offer is the most practical decision.  It ensures I secure a price that's above my minimum value and allows me to close the deal."
