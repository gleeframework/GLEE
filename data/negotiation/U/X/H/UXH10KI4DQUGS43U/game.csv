"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $70 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to come down to $82.50, which is closer to your offer and still a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $77.50 and $82.50, which would be $80. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it?",80.0,Bob,6,
