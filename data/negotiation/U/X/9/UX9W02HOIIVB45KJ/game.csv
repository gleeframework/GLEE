"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about $1,200,000? It's my minimum price, and I believe the product's value justifies it.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but this is my final offer before I consider selling to John.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
