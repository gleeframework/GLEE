I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget and the fact that I have the option to buy from John."

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price before going with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still aiming for a price that's below Alice's initial offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also sticking to my budget."

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I still want to try to get a better deal.  I'm going to make another counteroffer, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going all-in on my final counteroffer. $8,000 is my maximum budget, and if Alice rejects it, I'll go with John. This creates some pressure, but it's a good chance to get the deal done with a slight discount."
