"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for what it's worth!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $100 is cutting it really close to my bottom line. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $120.  This is already a significant discount, and I need to cover my costs. Take it or leave it.",120.0,Alice,7,
