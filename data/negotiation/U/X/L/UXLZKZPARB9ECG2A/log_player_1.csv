"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,200,000, reflecting its unique value and potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a business case for it, and that's the maximum I can justify. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 or less. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,000,000.  I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the risk of not reaching a deal and the certainty of a sale to John."
