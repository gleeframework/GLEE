"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a business case for it, and that's the maximum I can justify.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both some room to compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 or less. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
