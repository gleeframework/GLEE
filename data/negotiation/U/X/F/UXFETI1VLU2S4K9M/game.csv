,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap -  how about $10,250? That's a small step closer to your offer, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,900?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to make one more concession.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I really think this could be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,7,
