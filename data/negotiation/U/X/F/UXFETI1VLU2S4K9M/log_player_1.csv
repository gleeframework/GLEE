"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I've included a question to open the door for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Remember:**  This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how many rounds are left before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, which gives me room to negotiate further with Bob. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is upbeat and invites Bob to continue the conversation.

**Strategy:**

By sticking with a counteroffer, I aim to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while still securing a profit above Bob's initial perceived value.  I'm also leaving room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my minimum by continuing to negotiate.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap -  how about $10,250? That's a small step closer to your offer, and we can finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, but staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasize finding a middle ground:**  I'm emphasizing the need to bridge the gap, encouraging Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Keep the negotiation positive:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the conversation going.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to spark a positive response and move closer to a mutually acceptable price. I'm also mindful of the remaining rounds, ensuring I don't concede too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still secure a price closer to my minimum by continuing to negotiate.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to make one more concession.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I really think this could be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm stressing the fairness of the price considering the product's value.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  However, I will also take into account the number of rounds remaining and Bob's potential for a counteroffer closer to my minimum."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:** I only have two rounds left, and I'm unlikely to close a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time remaining and the likelihood of a continued stalemate with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible decision. This ensures I receive the minimum value I'm seeking for the product."
