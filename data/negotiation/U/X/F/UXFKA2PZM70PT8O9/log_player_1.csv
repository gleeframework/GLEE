Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I am only willing to pay up to $950000 for it. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
