"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than John's offer of $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
