"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significant discount, but still leaves room for compromise.  It signals a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I still believe there's room for further negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, I can continue the process and potentially get a price closer to my ideal $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round is about sticking to your guns.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and your counteroffer demonstrates your commitment to your target price. This strategy might encourage Alice to reconsider her offer and potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still committed to getting the product for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and I believe there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the mid-point of the negotiation. I've stayed firm on my target price, showing Alice that I'm serious about it. This round is about reiterating my commitment and pushing for a final agreement.  If Alice still refuses, I have the option to buy from John, but I'd prefer to get a better deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can offer you the product for $10,800. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is very close to my target price of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, or I might end up having to pay John's price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and saves me from potentially losing a good deal."
