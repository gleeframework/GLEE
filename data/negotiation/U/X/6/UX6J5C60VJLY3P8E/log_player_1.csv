Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below what the product is worth to Bob:** This gives him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with. You can adjust the price and your message in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. You have some room to negotiate further, so rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $127.50 is close to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You can try to push for a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer.  There's a good chance Bob is willing to budge a bit more to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference once more and meet at $128.75? It's a small step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 128.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about we meet at $128? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You've reached a point where further negotiation might be futile. Bob is clearly sticking to his budget. Accepting his offer at $128 is a good compromise. It's still above your minimum acceptable price, and it ensures you can finalize the sale.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower profit margin."
