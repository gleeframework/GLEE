"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $12,000 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate.  We're aiming to be somewhere between our maximum price ($10,000) and the lowest price Alice might consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested! While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we're still willing to push a little further. Let's see if we can get her closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

We're inching closer to our maximum price while still leaving room for some final negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting us in the middle at $9,750.  This is a good price, saving us $250 compared to John's offer.  It's a reasonable compromise and we've successfully negotiated a better deal."
