Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is still higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is interested in the product at a price close to my desired value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I can lower the price slightly if needed.
* **Maintain leverage:** I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to maximize my earnings, I'm also willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  I can still sell to John for a much higher price. 
* **Signal my seriousness:**  Rejecting his low offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Continue the negotiation:** I'll make a counteroffer to try and reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This price is a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much. 
* **The message:** I reiterate my willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** Get closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** Avoid a stalemate and reach a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still too low for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price.
* **Show my resolve:**  Rejecting his offer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Continue the negotiation:** I can make another counteroffer to try and reach a price that works for both of us.

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value but still acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,750:** This price is a compromise between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $10,500. It's a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **The message:** I reiterate my willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:** Get even closer to a mutually acceptable price.

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price and can always sell to John."
