"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table, especially for a business like yours, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential return on your investment.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your firm stance, but I need you to understand this product's potential for your business.  It's not just about the value today, but the future growth it can unlock. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I hear your enthusiasm for the product's future potential, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll have to look at other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
