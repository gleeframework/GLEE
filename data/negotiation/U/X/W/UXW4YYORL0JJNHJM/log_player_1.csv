Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $180 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my original offer of $120.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.

You have three options:

Bob is holding firm at a price too low for me. It's unlikely he'll go much higher and I already have a guaranteed sale at $150.  It's time to move on to John."
