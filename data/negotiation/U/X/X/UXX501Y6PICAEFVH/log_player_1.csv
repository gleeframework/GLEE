Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is our initial offer, there might be room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn even more.
* **Above Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit.

**Important:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he'd have less incentive to pay more than $100."
