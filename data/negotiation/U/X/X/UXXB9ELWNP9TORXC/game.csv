"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,060,000.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're making progress, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
