Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're making progress, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer. $1,070,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the difference is unlikely to be substantial.  There's also the risk that Alice might not budge further, and you'll end up having to pay a higher price or buy from John anyway."
