"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
