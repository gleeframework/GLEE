(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently moving towards your desired price point, even if in smaller increments. At $815,000, you're getting a significant discount from both her starting price and John's offer. Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate Alice and make her less likely to negotiate further. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially smaller saving."
