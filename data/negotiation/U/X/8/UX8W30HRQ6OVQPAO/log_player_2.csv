# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is valued at $12000 by us, reflecting its quality, functionality, and rarity. We believe it could be a valuable addition to your collection or business. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob's maximum budget is $8,000. Alice's initial offer is $12,000 which is far above Bob's budget. It's logical for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my maximum limit. Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. Our product is indeed quite unique, but I'd like to make it more accessible to you. I propose a price of $9500 for the product. This still reflects its true value while allowing for a more favorable deal for you. I hope this offer suits your needs better.

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $8,000.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as this ensures he stays within his budget."
