I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves a healthy profit margin for me. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still leaves a comfortable profit margin for me. It also provides an opportunity for Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob's offer, I'm still not getting the amount I want.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's better to sell to him and ensure I get the price I need."
