It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can potentially get a better price than from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me. While I'm interested, $9,200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,200, but I'm still not happy with that price. I think we can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. This is my final offer on that range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a lower price, but $9,000 is getting closer to my target. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,900. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go lower than $9,100. I'm close to my goal, but I'm not willing to risk another counteroffer and potentially lose the deal. It's better to go with John's offer and secure the product for $10,000, even if it's slightly above my ideal price."
