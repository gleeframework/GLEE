"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save even more money by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, especially since she's trying to make a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm really interested in this product, so I'd be happy to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price. Accepting the offer at $11,500 allows Bob to save $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially leading to a higher price from John makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
