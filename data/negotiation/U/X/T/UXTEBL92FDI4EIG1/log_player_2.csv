# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your perspective, but this product is truly valuable and holds significant worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,200,000? This reflects a compromise on both our parts, and ensures a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
