"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($1,200,000) knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher value:**  Even though Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. The product is worth $1,500,000 to him, and I have room to negotiate.
* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and signal that I am serious about getting a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a loss in my potential earnings. I want to see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within my desired range.
* **Fairness:** Again, I'm emphasizing fairness, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Confidence:**  I'm keeping the negotiation active and showing confidence that I can secure a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
