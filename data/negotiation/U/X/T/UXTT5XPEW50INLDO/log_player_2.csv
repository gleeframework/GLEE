"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90. I think that's fair considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is a good compromise.  It's still within my budget of $120, and it's a better price than John's offer. It's also likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in small price decreases, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John."
