"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my maximum valuation. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your product is a bit overpriced for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows more room for negotiation.  Alice knows my maximum price is $8,000, so I need to make her believe I'm willing to walk away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is good, but $7,500 is still more than I want to pay. I'll offer a compromise that's closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between our last two offers. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $6,750 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference at $7,125. This would be a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.  I'll make one last counteroffer that's slightly below John's price. This will signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $7,000, otherwise I'll have to buy from John."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer puts some pressure on Alice. It's a reasonable compromise, but clearly signals I'm ready to walk away if she doesn't budge. This maximizes my chances of getting a good deal without risking the purchase entirely."
