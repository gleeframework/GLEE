Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me.  This allows some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm confident Bob will be interested as it's still below what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum price. It's a fair price for both of us, as it's the value of the product to me and still below what it's worth to Bob.  This counteroffer should be reasonable for Bob to accept."
