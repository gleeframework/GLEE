Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price.  It also provides a good starting point for understanding Bob's level of interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is a good amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, and  shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much of the potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and prevents further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
