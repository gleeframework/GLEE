Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to bargain and might even lead to a better outcome than expected. 
* **Leave room for Bob:**  While you know Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $200 leaves space for negotiation and makes him feel like he can get a ""deal.""
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale at $150.  This knowledge lets you be firmer in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches your minimum acceptable price. However, you already have a guaranteed offer from John at the same price. 

Since there's no financial advantage to accepting Bob's offer over John's, it's more efficient to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
