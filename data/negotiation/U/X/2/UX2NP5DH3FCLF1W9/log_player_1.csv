Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for significant return.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""immense value"" and ""significant return.""
* **Urgency and Competition:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back-and-forth negotiation, allowing you to adjust your offer based on Bob's reactions and counter-offers."
