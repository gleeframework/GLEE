"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
