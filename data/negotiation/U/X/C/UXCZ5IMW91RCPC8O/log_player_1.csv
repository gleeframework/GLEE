Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a higher profit than selling to John for $15,000.  It's a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, while also staying close to my desired value. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired range.  Considering the time and effort spent negotiating, I'm going to accept the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
