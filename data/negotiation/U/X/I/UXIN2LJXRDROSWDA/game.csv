"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to get it for a lower price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, so how about $97.50? That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
