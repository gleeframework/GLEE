"Alice, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,5,
