# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $12000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to purchase it for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
