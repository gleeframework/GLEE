Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $11,500 is a reasonable deal. It's significantly less than John's $15,000 offer and Alice is indicating this is her final offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
