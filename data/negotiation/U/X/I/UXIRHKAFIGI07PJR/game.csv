"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $13,000. This would give us both a good deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still committed to $13,000. It's a fair price given the value of the product to you. Let's focus on the price for now, and we can talk about additional perks or services later if we reach an agreement. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
