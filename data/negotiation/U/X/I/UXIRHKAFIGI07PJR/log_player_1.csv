"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $13,000. This would give us both a good deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, but I'd like to discuss some additional perks or services that would make the deal more attractive to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for less than $13,000 at this point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm also going to try to get him to focus on the price first, and then we can discuss additional perks."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're committed to $13,000, but I'm afraid I've gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.
