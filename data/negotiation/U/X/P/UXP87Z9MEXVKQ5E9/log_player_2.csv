It's not worth accepting Alice's offer at this point.  We can try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

Let's start with a lower offer of $9,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we're both happy with."

We can still try to get a better price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Let's see if Alice will accept $10,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, but it's still a good deal for both of us."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn, and it's getting close to the end of our rounds.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth risking losing the product entirely.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the safest option at this point."
