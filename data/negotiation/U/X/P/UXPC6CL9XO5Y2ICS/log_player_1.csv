Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum**:  We know Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning he wouldn't pay more than that.
* **Leaving room for negotiation**: Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a price he might find more agreeable, closer to his valuation. 
* **Maximizing profit**:  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. By starting high but not unreasonably so, we aim to secure the best possible deal."
