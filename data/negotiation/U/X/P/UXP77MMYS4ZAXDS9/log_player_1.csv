Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $100,000 discount from his perceived value, and I make a $100,000 profit over my guaranteed sale.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct, expressing enthusiasm while clearly stating the price and rationale."
