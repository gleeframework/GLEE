Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer,  $1200000 doesn't fully reflect the unique value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price still reflects the product's worth and the potential benefits you can reap.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.
