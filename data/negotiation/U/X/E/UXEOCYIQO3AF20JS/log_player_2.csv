# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my [product name] at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair. This leaves significant room for profit on your end while ensuring I receive a very good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. 
* **You can get a better deal from John.** Even though you would prefer to buy from Alice, John's offer of $1,500,000 is still within your budget and saves you money compared to Alice's offer."
