Round 4

We are still significantly above John's offer, and we have time to negotiate. Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price."

We're getting close, but Bob's increments are getting smaller. We need to push a bit harder to see if he's willing to go higher."

While we could push Bob further, his offer is now only $25,000 away from our last counteroffer. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to our desired price. Accepting $1,750,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
