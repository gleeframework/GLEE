"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also pushing for a significant discount. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  A $200,000 reduction is a substantial amount, but it leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. I believe this price reflects the immense potential of this product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.  Bob can likely get the price lower than $1,325,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's potential, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price is closer to my budget, and it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing he's willing to compromise by increasing his offer to $1,250,000. This is still below Alice's current offer, but it shows that he's serious about making a deal. The counteroffer also emphasizes the importance of finding a compromise that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,280,000. I believe this is a very fair offer, considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly. Bob's goal is to save money, and while he could continue negotiating, the current offer of $1,280,000 is a good deal.  It's lower than what John would charge, and Bob is getting closer to his ideal price point.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in small price drops, so it's better to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
