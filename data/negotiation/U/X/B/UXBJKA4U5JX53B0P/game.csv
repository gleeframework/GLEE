"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
