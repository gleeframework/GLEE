"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering we both want to come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
