Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial ask. While I want to find common ground, accepting a price that low would be a substantial loss.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.
