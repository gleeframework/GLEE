"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my desire to close this deal with you.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
