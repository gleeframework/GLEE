"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I am still not willing to settle at a price that is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can still reach a better price.  There is a chance that Bob will accept a higher price, or that I can push him further towards my desired price.  If the negotiations don't go well, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's be reasonable here - I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I've already made significant concessions, but I have a few more rounds to try and push for a better deal. I'm also concerned about setting a precedent for accepting lower prices too early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this.  I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If you're serious about buying, I'm sure we can agree on this. If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, which is a fair price for me. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's clear that we are at an impasse, and I'm not willing to further lower my price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option at this point. It ensures that I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further rounds resulting in an even lower price."
