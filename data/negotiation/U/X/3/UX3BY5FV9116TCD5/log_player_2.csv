Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go a bit lower, though. How about $90? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $92? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go down to $80.  She's sticking close to her original offer and making small concessions. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially missing out on the $80 deal with John."
