"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering my budget and its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to go up to $900,000 for this product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be more flexible. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
