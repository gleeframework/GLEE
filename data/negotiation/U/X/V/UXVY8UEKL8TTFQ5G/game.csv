"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be open to $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
