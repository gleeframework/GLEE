"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's $12,000 offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It's also still well above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for a potential compromise. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price point, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price again, potentially reaching a price closer to your target. You're not desperate to buy the product, so you can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price, but her counter-offer shows that she's willing to negotiate.  Increasing your offer slightly to $10,500 demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while still being within your budget.  This is a middle ground that shows you're willing to compromise but still want a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, it's getting closer to your maximum budget of $15,000. Continuing to reject and counteroffer risks a stalemate or Alice backing out of the negotiation entirely. At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
