Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum price. I want to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to push the price down, but $9,800 is simply not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $10,400? This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,200. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below it. I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm hoping that with a counteroffer, we can close the deal in the next round. However, if the next round fails, I'll be ready to sell to John for $12,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,300.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I've tried to negotiate in good faith, but it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me in the middle.  To maximize my profits, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is the price I'm guaranteed."
