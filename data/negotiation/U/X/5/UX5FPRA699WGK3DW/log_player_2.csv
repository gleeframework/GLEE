"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet halfway again and try $12,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already willing to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my target price of $10,000 or even $12,500. Since I can always buy from John for $10,000, I have some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a good compromise from both of our last offers. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,750. I'm willing to meet you at $13,200, which is a small increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to go down to $13,200. At this point, we are running out of rounds and I'm not sure if I can get her to come down further. Considering I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John now."
