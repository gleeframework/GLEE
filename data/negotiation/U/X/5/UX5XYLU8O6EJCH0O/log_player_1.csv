Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth. What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe we can push Bob a little further.  We'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,270,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:

}

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,270,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000 and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're reaching a point where further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows you to utilize the funds sooner."
