"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
