"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it! I'm asking for $110, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still quite a bit more than I'm ideally willing to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting us in the middle at $85 is a reasonable compromise. It's more than I wanted to spend initially, but still cheaper than John's offer and likely worth it to avoid further negotiation."
