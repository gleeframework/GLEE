"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. While $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1175000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the concession, Alice. However, $1175000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to offer $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can meet me at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
