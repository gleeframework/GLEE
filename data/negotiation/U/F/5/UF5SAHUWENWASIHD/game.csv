"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I still think $1,425,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,325,000. Can we agree on that price?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
