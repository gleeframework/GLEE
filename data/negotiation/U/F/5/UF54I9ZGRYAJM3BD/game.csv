"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $100?  That's a good price point for both of us, and allows us to make a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $98, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $98, which would be $96.50. Can you consider that?",96.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $96.50 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference between $98 and $96.50.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $97.25.  That's the best I can do.",97.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $97.25 is a good offer, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96.50 and $97.25, which would be $96.875. Can you consider that?",96.875,Bob,8,
