Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value and potential benefits to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly below what the product is worth to both of us. Let's negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

```

While we could push for a bit more, accepting $875,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds our minimum and avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down."
