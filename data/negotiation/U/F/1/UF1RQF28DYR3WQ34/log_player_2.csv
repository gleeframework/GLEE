"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's room to go down from $140 before reaching your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer starts by being significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while staying above Alice's minimum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose an alternative at $125 for the product. This still offers a good value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but there's still some room for negotiation. Let's try to meet her closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between the last two offers. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer."
