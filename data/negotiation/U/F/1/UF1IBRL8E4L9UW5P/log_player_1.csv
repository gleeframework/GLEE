{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that the deal is good for both of us. This can help Bob feel more comfortable negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a good starting point because:

* It gives me a decent profit.
* It's likely that Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* I have the safety net of John's offer, so I can walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have room to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **John's Offer:** I have John's offer as a backup, ensuring I can get at least my minimum. 

**Next Step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, perhaps offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a significantly discounted price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $950,000?  This would give me a bit more wiggle room, and I think it's still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $900,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focusing on mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** While $950,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still significantly above my minimum of $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to:

* Show that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* Keep the conversation moving towards a possible agreement.
* Still maintain a decent profit margin.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to:

* Counteroffer again, moving slightly closer to his price.
* Accept his offer (if it's close enough to my minimum).
*  Go with John's offer to guarantee my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $925,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Compromise:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise, meeting me halfway again.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John for $1,200,000, earning less.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal. It's a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied."
