Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is below my minimum price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a compromise with Bob that's fair for both of us."

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob if we could agree on a better price, I'm not willing to go that low.  I'll sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
