Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your walk-away price:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. This is your ""walk-away"" price â€“ the minimum you'll accept.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and your minimum ($15,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup, you're not at risk of losing the minimum value of the product."
