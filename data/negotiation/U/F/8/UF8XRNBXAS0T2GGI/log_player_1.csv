Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It's also friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.  I'm confident this will start the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm getting frustrated. I don't want to go through another round of negotiation, especially since I know I can sell the product to John for $120.  I'm going to choose option (3) and sell to John."
