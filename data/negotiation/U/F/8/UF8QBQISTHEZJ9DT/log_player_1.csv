Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($11,000) gives you some space to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob tries to negotiate, while still ensuring a significant profit. 
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of him accepting without further negotiation.

**Important:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
