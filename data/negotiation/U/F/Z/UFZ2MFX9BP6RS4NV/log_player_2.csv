"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a discount, but $500,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,050,000 and  it's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 than risk Alice sticking to her ""final offer."""
