"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to make it work.  How about we start at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a discount, but $500,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
