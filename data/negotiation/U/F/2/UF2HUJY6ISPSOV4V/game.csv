"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to go to $1400000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1400000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is as close as I can get to your target price while still maintaining the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to negotiating further. If not, I'll consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
