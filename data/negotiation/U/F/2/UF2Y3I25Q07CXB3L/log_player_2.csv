# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $1250000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to consider $1350000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1300000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider $1375000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is still above my budget.  While we are getting closer, I'm concerned that further negotiation may not get me to my target price. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at a guaranteed price.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
