"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it reflects the value I place on it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $1250000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to consider $1350000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1300000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1300000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to consider $1375000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
