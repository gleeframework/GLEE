"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to earn a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Buying from Alice saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  While Alice could potentially make a slightly higher profit, she is still willing to sell the product for a price below what it's worth to Bob. This indicates that she values a quick sale over maximizing her profit."
