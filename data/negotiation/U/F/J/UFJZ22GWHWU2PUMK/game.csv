"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still can't quite go that high.  How about $700,000? That's the best I can do.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $700,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $725,000?  That's a fair price, considering the value and what we've already discussed.  This is my final offer.",725000.0,Alice,5,
