"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer from Bob is significantly lower than what I want for the product. It's worth it for me to try and negotiate further before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little on the price.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still can't quite go that high.  How about $700,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $700,000 is closer to my goal, I still feel I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $700,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $725,000?  That's a fair price, considering the value and what we've already discussed.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 725000}
