Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting high, you demonstrate confidence in the value of your product and create a sense of urgency for Bob.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response and how eager you are to close the deal. You can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 as your safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than your desired price:** While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **You have leverage:** Bob rejected your initial offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher price if you counteroffer.
* **The risk is manageable:** You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next steps:** You will need to decide on a counteroffer to Bob. Consider factors like:

* How likely is Bob to accept a higher price?
* How much time are you willing to spend negotiating?
* How eager are you to sell the product?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. It signals your willingness to compromise while still being profitable for you.
* **Keeping the pressure on:** It's a higher price than Bob's offer, reminding him that you still have a higher valuation and are not desperate to sell.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** This counteroffer is less likely to be immediately rejected, allowing for continued negotiations.

**Next steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:** Analyze whether he accepts, counters, or rejects the offer. 
* **Adjust strategy:** Based on Bob's response, you can decide to further adjust the price or consider selling to John if the negotiation doesn't seem to be progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 below your minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation stalemate:** Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher, and further counteroffers might lead to a prolonged and potentially fruitless negotiation.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might require significant effort and time without guaranteeing a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the potential for a protracted negotiation without a significant improvement in price, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and time-efficient decision."
