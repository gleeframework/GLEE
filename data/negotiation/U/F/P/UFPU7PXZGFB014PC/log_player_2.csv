"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very beneficial. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a deal you can't refuse.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. 
* **You can get a better deal:** You can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is still within your budget. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer creates negotiation leverage:** By rejecting, you show Alice that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This might encourage her to lower her price in the future."
