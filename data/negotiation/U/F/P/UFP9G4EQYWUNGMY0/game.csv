"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product, but I need to see some flexibility on your side to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit higher than I can justify at this point. I'm willing to go up to $650000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $675000. I think this is the best we can do, considering the product's value to me.",675000.0,Alice,5,
