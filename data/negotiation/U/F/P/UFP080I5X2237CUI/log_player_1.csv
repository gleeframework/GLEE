Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The $1,250,000 offer allows for some bargaining without forcing me to accept an unacceptably low price. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the potential value to Bob.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and consider if it's worth continuing negotiations.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer.
* If I feel like the negotiation is going nowhere, I'll switch to selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to get closer to my desired price.  
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll craft a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my desired price.
* I'll consider factors like Bob's budget constraints and his level of interest in the product to determine the best counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize why this price is reasonable. 
* **Finding common ground:** I'm using positive language to encourage further negotiation and a potential agreement.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and either accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell to John if his offer isn't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. I'm thinking of $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer and is willing to walk away, suggesting there's no room for further negotiation to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John offers a better deal:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price, avoiding the risk of a deal falling through with Bob. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
