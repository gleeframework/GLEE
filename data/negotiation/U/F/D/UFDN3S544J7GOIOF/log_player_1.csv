"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price considering its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you're willing to compromise.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and more reasonable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While aiming high, we also need to be aware that we have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000. We don't want to start so high that Bob walks away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for the highest possible price and are willing to counter to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show willingness to negotiate by reducing our price.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and his counteroffer is a common negotiation tactic, signaling fairness.
* **Maintaining Value:** While we're moving closer to Bob's offer, we're still holding firm on a price significantly above our guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to keep costs lower. Could you possibly reduce the price to $1,360,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating in small increments, indicating he's likely willing to go higher. We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to push for a better deal. A counteroffer will test Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a way for us to agree. How about this: $1,365,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1365000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Introducing a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Concession:** We're still meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Profit Margin:**  Even at $1,365,000, we're securing a substantial profit above John's offer. It's time to push for closure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,355,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,355,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,355,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is now negotiating in very small increments, suggesting we're reaching his upper limit. 
* **Strong Profit:** Accepting $1,355,000 still gives us a significant profit margin over our guaranteed sale to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a slightly higher price increases the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving us to settle for the lower amount from John.  

It's time to close the deal and secure a very favorable outcome."
