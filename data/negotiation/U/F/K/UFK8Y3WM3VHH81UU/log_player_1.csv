Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. This helps build rapport and might make him more inclined to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profits:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  A $1,250,000 starting point allows room for counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Protect against a ""no deal"" scenario:** If negotiations break down, I can always go to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for $1,100,000 just yet. I can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above his current offer. I want to see if he's willing to budge further towards my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,150,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm staying friendly and reiterating the value of the product, emphasizing that this offer is fair to both parties.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Continue negotiations:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the price Bob is offering.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  By coming down in price, I'm increasing the chance that Bob will accept the offer.
* **Protect my interests:** I'm still asking for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, so I can still earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is too low for me. It's getting closer to his perceived value of $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. It's a safer and more profitable option at this point."
