Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget, and I'd like to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your need for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we try $10,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $10,200 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
