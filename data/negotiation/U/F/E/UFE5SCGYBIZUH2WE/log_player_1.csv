Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** John acts as a safety net, ensuring you'll get at least $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start higher.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** We highlight the ""unique value and potential,"" framing the product as a worthwhile investment. 
* **Confidence:** We project confidence in the offer, avoiding language that suggests desperation to sell.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a profit above your minimum and Bob's valuation.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  Be prepared to slightly lower the price, but hold firm around $1,600,000. Remember, you have John as a backup.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You proceed to sell to John at your desired price.

**Important:** This is just one approach.  You can adjust the offer and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
