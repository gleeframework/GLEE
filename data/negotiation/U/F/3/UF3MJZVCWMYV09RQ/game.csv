"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a good compromise for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
