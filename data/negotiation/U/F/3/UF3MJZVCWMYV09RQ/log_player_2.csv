# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John at $8,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point."
