# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to pay full price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
