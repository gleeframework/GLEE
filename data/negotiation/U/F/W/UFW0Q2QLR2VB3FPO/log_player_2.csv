"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product that I know you're interested in. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to consider other options or negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
