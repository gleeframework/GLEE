Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 sets a strong initial point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation but still within a potentially acceptable range.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to make the offer more appealing and justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion (""Let me know your thoughts...""), signaling a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob while also considering the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John. By starting high, Alice gives herself room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can then decide whether to significantly lower the price or move on to John."
