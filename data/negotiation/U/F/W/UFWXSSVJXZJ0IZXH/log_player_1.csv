Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob some incentive to counteroffer. This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's valuation of $12,000 while also keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to settle at that low of a price just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,250, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still keeping the price closer to my desired range."
