"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
