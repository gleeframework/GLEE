Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident it's worth the investment given its potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential over $1,000,000:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's a chance he perceives its potential value even higher, especially if it's unique or irreplaceable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still landing you a significant profit.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  A lot depends on the specific product and your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
