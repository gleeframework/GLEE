"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very valuable. Would you like to make an initial offer?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $700000 is a reasonable price, but I'm afraid the product's value is much higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $700000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more significant reduction. How about $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more significant reduction, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to protect my investment. I'm counteroffering at $780000. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $780000, which would be $740000. That's my final offer.",740000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $760000. This is my last offer before I start to consider other options.",760000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually acceptable price.
