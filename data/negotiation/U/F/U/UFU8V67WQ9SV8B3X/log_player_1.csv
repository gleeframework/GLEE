Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your minimum acceptable price is set. You want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * You gain an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting higher gives you some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's exact budget or negotiation style. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer's circumstances could lead to an even more tailored and potentially profitable offer."
