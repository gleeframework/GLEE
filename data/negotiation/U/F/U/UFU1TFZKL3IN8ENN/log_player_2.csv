"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'll choose option 2) Reject Alice's offer. I don't want to pay more than I have to, and I can get the product from John for $120, which is a better deal.
