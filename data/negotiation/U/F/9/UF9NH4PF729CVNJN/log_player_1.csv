Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a premium price of $150. I believe it holds significant value and this reflects that. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** By framing the high price with ""premium"" and mentioning ""significant value,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the potential for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob explicitly stated his maximum price is $100. This indicates he's unlikely to budge much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer significantly.  Selling to John guarantees you the $100 immediately. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better offer than John's $100.

Since your goal is to maximize profit, and you have a guaranteed offer at your minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell to John now."
