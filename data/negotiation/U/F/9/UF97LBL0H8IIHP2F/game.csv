,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counteroffer at $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the lowest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the value of the product and our previous discussions. I'll counteroffer at $108. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and your willingness to negotiate.",108.0,Alice,5,
