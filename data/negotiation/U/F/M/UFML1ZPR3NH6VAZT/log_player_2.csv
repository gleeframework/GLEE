"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a good deal compared to John's price of $120, Bob can potentially get an even better price by counter-offering. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower than $115, especially since the product is only worth $100 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** Alice's counter-offer of $110 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $120.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer again, potentially leading to a stalemate or forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Compromise:** Accepting Alice's offer represents a compromise where Bob saves $10 compared to John's price and Alice gets closer to her desired price."
