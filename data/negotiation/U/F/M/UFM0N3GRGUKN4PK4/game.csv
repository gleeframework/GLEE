"Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $20000. I believe it's a steal considering its value and potential. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. Would you be willing to go down to $8000? That's the absolute most I can afford.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good investment.",10000.0,Bob,4,
