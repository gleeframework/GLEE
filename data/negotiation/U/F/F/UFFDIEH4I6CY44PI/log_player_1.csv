Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate if he feels the product is worth more to him. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $120, so I'm not risking anything by going for a higher price."
