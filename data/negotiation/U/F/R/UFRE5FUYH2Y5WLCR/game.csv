"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the best I can do.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,900. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my own profit margins.",8900.0,Alice,5,
