Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to get as close to that as possible while still ensuring the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing within a very profitable range for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed backup to sell the product at your minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
