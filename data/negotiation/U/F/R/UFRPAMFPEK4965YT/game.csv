"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's still a good deal considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
