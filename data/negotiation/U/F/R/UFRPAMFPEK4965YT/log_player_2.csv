Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John than to risk Alice sticking to her price."
