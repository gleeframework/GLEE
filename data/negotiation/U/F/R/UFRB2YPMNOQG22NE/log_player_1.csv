Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're aiming for a higher profit than just the $1,200,000 you'd get from John.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept. 

By starting at $1,400,000, you can potentially negotiate up to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and get some profit, you can potentially get a much better price by continuing negotiations. Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows you to keep pushing for a price closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would result in the same amount.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge any further. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at a price you're comfortable with."
