Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. "",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start with a significantly higher offer.  This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's perception of the product.
* **Alternative Option:** While we don't explicitly mention John, the fact that we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 provides us with a strong fallback position if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
