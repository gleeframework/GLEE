"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This should leave Bob feeling like he can get a good deal, while still giving me a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I still have plenty of rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more reasonable starting point for the counteroffer. I'm hoping to get a deal done quickly, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still too low. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement. I still have six rounds left, so I'm in a good position to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,090,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping that this will be the final offer before I have to accept John's offer."
