"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While your valuation is understandable, the product's intrinsic value and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,275,000. This price takes into account the product's value, but also reflects my own budget constraints. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
