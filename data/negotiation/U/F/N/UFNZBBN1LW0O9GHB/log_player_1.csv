{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for some room for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still allows for a potential profit for you.  I'm keeping the price close to my minimum of $120 to incentivize Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $110 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still allowing for some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $115. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $108 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $108 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and continuing to negotiate with him risks lowering the price further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, which is better than risking a lower offer from Bob."
