"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering its true value.  Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and unlock the potential of this product for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  While $1,090,000 is still a bit higher than his initial goal, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, and Bob would then have to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
