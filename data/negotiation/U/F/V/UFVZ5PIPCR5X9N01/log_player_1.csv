Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll realize. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value I place on the product and offers you a good deal, considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$975,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hesitant to accept. There's a possibility of getting even closer to my goal, especially since Bob is showing clear interest.  I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and it's still a fantastic deal for you considering its potential. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to what I can get from John. While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal considering the limited time remaining.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more."
