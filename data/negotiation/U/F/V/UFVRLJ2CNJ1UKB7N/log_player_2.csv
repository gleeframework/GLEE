"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1200000, which is a 20% discount from the true value of $1500000, but still a significant profit for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to try and reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $800,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit while giving me a good value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. I'm confident that the product will bring significant value to your business, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for you and worth accepting. You've already achieved your goal of getting a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in future rounds.  Buying from John would cost the same, so accepting Alice's offer makes sense."
