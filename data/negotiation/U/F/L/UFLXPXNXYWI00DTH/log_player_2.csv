"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  I'm asking for $12000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than John's price.
* **You can still save money:** Even at $12,000, you are still getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save the most money."
