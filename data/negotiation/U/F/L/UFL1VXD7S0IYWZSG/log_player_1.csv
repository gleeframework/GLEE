Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's high, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the value Bob places on the product, but I also want to ensure I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to make sure I get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting a significant profit.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now only slightly below my minimum threshold. Accepting this offer ensures I earn a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
