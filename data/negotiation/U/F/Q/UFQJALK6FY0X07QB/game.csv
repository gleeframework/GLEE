"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. How about $1,050,000?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower offer. Let's split the difference - $1,075,000. This feels fair for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, how about $1,090,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both agree on. What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
