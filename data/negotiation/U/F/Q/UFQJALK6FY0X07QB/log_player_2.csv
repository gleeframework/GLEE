"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is still trying to get the price down and can counteroffer again. He is very close to John's price, so it might be worth it to see if he can get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower offer. Let's split the difference - $1,075,000. This feels fair for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go a little lower, how about $1,090,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both agree on. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's now only $90,000 over his ideal price from John. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price."
