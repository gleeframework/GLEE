"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make an offer of $6000 for the product. I'm looking for a good deal, but I'm also interested in making a purchase. Let's meet in the middle.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
