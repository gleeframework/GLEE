"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do any better?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,025,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a final offer of $975,000. This price point works best for me. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
