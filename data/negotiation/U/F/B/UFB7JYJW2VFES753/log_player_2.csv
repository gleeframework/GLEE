"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $1,500,000.  You can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
