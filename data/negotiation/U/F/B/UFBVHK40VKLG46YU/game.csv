"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a significant profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I can offer you a slight discount, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
