"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a high-quality item that's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to get this deal done.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still a little below my bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875.  That way, we can both feel like we got a fair price.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still looking to stay under $8,800.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,780?  That's a small difference but it would make this deal work for me.",8780.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,780 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $8,850. It's only a small difference, but it makes a big difference to me.  We're close to a deal - let's make it happen!",8850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $8,800. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,8,
