Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you negotiation room.
    *  Low enough to be enticing to Bob if he's highly interested or sees additional value you might not be aware of.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $150,000 over your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price and maximize your profit."
