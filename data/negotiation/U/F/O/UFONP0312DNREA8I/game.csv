"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford up to $8,000. Would you consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $12,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
