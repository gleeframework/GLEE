"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counter offer. That's a significant move, but still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  It's a fair price and would allow us to make this deal happen.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution. While $700,000 is still under my target, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a considerable compromise to bridge the gap. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
