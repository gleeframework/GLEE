"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling this product. While I'm interested, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you considering your worth of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us within our respective budgets. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
