"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  It's worth $1,200,000 to me, but she's only asking for $900,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling this product. While I'm interested, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you considering your worth of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still too high. I can afford to keep negotiating and aim for a price closer to my desired $750,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a middle ground."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us within our respective budgets. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
