Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer allows room for Bob to negotiate or accept outright. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $149 feels significantly cheaper than $150, potentially swaying Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's true valuation of the product. If she knew it was only worth $80 to him, a different approach would be needed."
