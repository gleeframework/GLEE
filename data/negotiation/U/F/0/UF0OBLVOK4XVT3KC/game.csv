"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to sell it for at least $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to sell it for at least $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to move on to another seller.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $100. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Alice,7,
