"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm really interested in this product but my budget is tight.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle on $125. That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go down to $125. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $128? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",128.0,Alice,5,
