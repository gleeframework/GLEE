Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $142.50.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go much lower than $140. At this point, the potential savings of a few dollars aren't worth the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and missing out on the guaranteed $120 deal with John."
