"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 for you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This allows for a fair profit for me while still being a competitive price for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
