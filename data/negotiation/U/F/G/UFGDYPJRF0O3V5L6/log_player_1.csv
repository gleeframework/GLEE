"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
