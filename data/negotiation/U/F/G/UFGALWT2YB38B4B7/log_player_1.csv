Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it means he's interested but wants to discuss price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.  This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
