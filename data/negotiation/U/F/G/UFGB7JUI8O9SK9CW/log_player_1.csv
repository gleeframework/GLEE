Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking for $1,750,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing its worth to you or John.  This encourages Bob to focus on his own valuation. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the offer can make Bob more likely to consider it seriously.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
