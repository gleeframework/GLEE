"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget.  Let's make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a premium service package worth $1000 for free.
