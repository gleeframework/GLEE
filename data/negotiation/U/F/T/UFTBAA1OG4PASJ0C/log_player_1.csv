"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the potential profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room to negotiate further and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to try to make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, only $25,000 below Bob's last offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.  If he rejects this, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer. I'm hoping that the small difference between his offer and my desired price will encourage him to accept. If he rejects this, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to try one last time to get a better price than John's offer.  This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum and I have no reason to continue negotiating. I'll sell to John for $800,000 to secure a deal."
