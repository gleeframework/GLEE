Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $150. However, it's a calculated risk to try for a higher profit margin before settling for your guaranteed $100 from John."
