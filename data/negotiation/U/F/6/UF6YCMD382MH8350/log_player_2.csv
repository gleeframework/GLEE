"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to making a decision, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to match the $675,000 offer just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $725,000, which is still a compromise considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further discussion.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $700,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly, especially if she knows we have another offer. At this point, the potential savings from haggling with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her not budging and us ending up with an even worse deal. John's offer of $800,000 is our safety net and ensures we don't overpay."
