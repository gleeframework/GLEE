"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a lower price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I'm considering another offer close to $675,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to finalize the deal today.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to making a decision, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to match the $675,000 offer just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $725,000, which is still a compromise considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further discussion.",725000.0,Alice,5,
