"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product is a great opportunity for me, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be careful with my finances.",950000.0,Bob,4,
