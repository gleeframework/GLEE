Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit above your minimum. This price also provides Bob a potential gain ($100,000) compared to his alternative of not securing the product. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay."
