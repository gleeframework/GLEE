Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal if he's prone to haggling.
* **Ensure a Sale:**  While I could try a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. This offer makes it very likely he'll accept, guaranteeing a profit over selling to John."
