"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to engage in the discussion.

**Strategy:** 
My strategy is to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000. By starting high, I put pressure on Bob to negotiate, hoping to land a deal above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Keeping John as an option:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open to potentially reaching a deal with Bob that's more favorable, while also ensuring I can still sell to John as a backup.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will aim for a price point that is closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,700,000 is a significant drop from my initial $2,000,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focusing on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify my price point, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Open-ended invitation:** I end with a question to encourage further discussion and keep the negotiation alive.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's close to my desired range, but still allows for more negotiation rounds. By staying firm on my minimum price and demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I hope to close the deal at a point that is mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still looking to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired range, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price point closer to my goal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to stay in control and potentially push for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still leaving room for further negotiation.  The goal is to secure a deal that maximizes my profits while considering the option of selling to John as a fallback."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not able to go below $1,650,000. This price reflects the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let's try to close this deal with a final offer."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Stance:**  I'm positioning this as a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Increment:**  My counteroffer of $1,650,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value and Opportunity:** I emphasize the value and potential benefits of the product to reinforce the justification for my price.

**Strategy:**

By presenting this as a final offer and aiming for a slightly higher price point, I hope to entice Bob to accept.  However, I'm still prepared to reject his next counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $1625000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired range, there's a risk of rejecting this offer and ending up with nothing if Bob walks away. 
* **Time Factor:**  With only four rounds remaining, I need to be pragmatic and consider the possibility of not getting a better offer. 

**Strategy:**  
Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a profit while ensuring I don't miss out on a potential sale entirely. The risk of rejecting and potentially losing the deal outweighs the potential for a small increase in price."
