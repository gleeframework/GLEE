"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $950,000 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much as possible. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about negotiating and encourage her to come down in price.
* **John is a fallback option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you a safety net during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $850,000. Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While her offer is lower, she's still above what you're comfortable with, and you want to save as much money as possible. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is likely to get you a better price.** You've shown Alice you're willing to walk away, and with rounds to spare, you can continue pushing for a lower price.
* **John is still a backup.**  You have other options if the negotiation stalls, so you have room to be firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your interest and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer.** Her offer is now within a reasonable range, but you're still aiming for the best possible price.
* **You have more leverage.** You have several rounds remaining, and by rejecting, you show Alice that you're not desperate for a deal. 
* **John is still an option.**  Having John as a fallback gives you confidence to push for a lower price.

By continuing to negotiate, you have a chance to push Alice even further down, potentially saving more money."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $875,000, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this a truly mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to pay $860,000. It's a small difference, but it's important to me to get the best value possible. Let's close this deal now and avoid further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 860000}
