"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This offer allows room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000, reflecting its true worth and potential for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,950,000 is still underselling the potential this product holds for your business.  I can go as low as $1,975,000, but that's my final offer.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth and my financial constraints.",1925000.0,Bob,6,
