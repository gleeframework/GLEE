Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd get from John, hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to negotiate.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, there's room for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but will be prepared to sell to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but still value the product higher than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to sell to John. The negotiations with Bob have taken a few rounds and haven't resulted in a price I'm truly happy with. It's better to secure the $10,000 and avoid further delays."
