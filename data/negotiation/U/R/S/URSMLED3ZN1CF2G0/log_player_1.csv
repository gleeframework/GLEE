``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum value of $15,000, but it's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  This creates a negotiation space where you can both potentially find a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  I've already made several compromises and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure that I get the value I deserve for my product."
