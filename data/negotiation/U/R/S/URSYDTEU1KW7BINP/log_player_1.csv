Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This price is higher than his perceived value ($8,000) but lower than what I could get from John ($10,000). 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $9,000 is closer to my desired price than $10,000.
* **Increase the likelihood of Bob accepting:** While $9,000 is a bit high for Bob, it's not an outrageous price and leaves some room for negotiation if he's interested.

If Bob rejects the offer, I can then sell the product to John for my desired $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
