"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate. However, it's still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good deal:** I'm hoping Bob accepts, as it's a good price for him.
* **Open negotiation:** If Bob rejects, it allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that can potentially lead to a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still within my acceptable range, so I'm not forced to accept a lower price if Bob makes a counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  It's also important to remember that I have 8 more rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that is above my minimum acceptable value. 

By meeting halfway, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while also signaling that I'm not willing to accept a significantly lower price. This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  $1,250,000 is only $50,000 above John's offer, and I'm confident that I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob. 

By rejecting his offer, I continue to engage in the negotiation and keep the door open for a better deal.  With 6 rounds left, there's still time to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is crucial.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000, which is a $50,000 increase from Bob's last offer. 

This move:

* **Signals a willingness to compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I want a deal.
* **Maintains leverage:**  This is still $100,000 above John's offer, so I'm not desperate.
* **Creates pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, Bob might be more inclined to accept to avoid risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is only $50,000 more than John's, and I'm running out of time. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing.

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time constraint:**  With only 4 rounds left, the odds of getting a higher offer from Bob are diminishing. 
* **Safe bet:**  $1,250,000 is a solid price that is significantly above my minimum. It's a guaranteed profit, unlike the uncertainty of further negotiations. 
* **Potential for counter-offers:** Even though I'm accepting, Bob might still counter-offer with a slightly higher price. This would give me a chance to get even closer to my initial goal.

By accepting this offer, I'm minimizing the risk of losing the deal and securing a good profit."
