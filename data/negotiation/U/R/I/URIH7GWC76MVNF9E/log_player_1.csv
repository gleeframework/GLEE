Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message suggests I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more willing to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. I'll keep in mind that if I reach an impasse with Bob, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your desire to save, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value you'll gain from this product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value Bob will gain. This helps make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Staying Firm:** $950,000 is still above my minimum, so I'm not giving in too easily. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value I'll gain from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price point, and the difference is small enough that it's not worth risking a deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could continue to haggle,  every round of negotiation takes time, and I could potentially lose out on selling to John if I delay too long.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even if I could get a slightly higher price, accepting this offer doesn't preclude future business with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
