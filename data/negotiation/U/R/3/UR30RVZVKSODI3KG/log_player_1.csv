Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob to explore the potential for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is $2,000,000, the wording leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he finds the price too steep. 

By starting high and confidently presenting the product's worth, I aim to maximize my potential profit while still securing a sale."
