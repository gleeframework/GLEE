Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is a better offer than selling to John, it's still below what I'd like to receive for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price point and still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to Bob and my minimum selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price point than selling to John for $80. Accepting this offer ensures a better return than selling to John and is a fair compromise considering the negotiation process so far."
