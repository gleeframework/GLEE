"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my own needs.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this, or we can consider alternative options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that the product's value will be evident once you've had a chance to use it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
