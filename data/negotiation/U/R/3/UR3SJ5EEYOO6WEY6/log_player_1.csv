{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I want to maximize my profit.  I'll be watching for his response and ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob seems unwilling to budge, and John offers a guaranteed $100, which meets my minimum requirement.  I'm not going to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the sale completely."
