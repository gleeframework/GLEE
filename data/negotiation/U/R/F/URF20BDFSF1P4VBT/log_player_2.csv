"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high ($1,000,000) compared to your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price.  
* There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so there's time to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After reviewing the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good middle ground for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. 
* There are still 7 rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying to push for a price closer to your limit. 
* If the negotiations fall through, you can still buy the product from John for $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $900,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a further compromise. After reviewing the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000.

* You have 5 rounds remaining, so there is still room to negotiate.
* While you could purchase from John for $800,000, it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than where I can go. I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $910,000 is a serious offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.
