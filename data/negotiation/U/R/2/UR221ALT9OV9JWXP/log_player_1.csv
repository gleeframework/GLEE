Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * He saves $100,000 from its perceived value to him.
    * You make a $400,000 profit, which is significant.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a small window open for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a deal that's very beneficial to him."
