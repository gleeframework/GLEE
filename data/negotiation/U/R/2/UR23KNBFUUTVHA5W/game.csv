,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. Let's reach a deal in this round.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
