"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to accept $925,000. This price still leaves significant value for you while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
