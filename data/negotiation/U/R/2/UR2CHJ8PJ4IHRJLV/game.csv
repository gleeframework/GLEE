"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still reflects a significant value for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
