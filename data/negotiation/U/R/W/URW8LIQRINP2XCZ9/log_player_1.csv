Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer itself:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before moving to John.

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but still significantly above your minimum.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Confident Language:**  ""I'm confident..."" implies the value is clear.
* **Strong Price:** $1,350,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential worth to you"" reminds Bob of the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You could aim even higher, but be prepared to potentially lose the deal with Bob."
