# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate closer to your desired price point."
