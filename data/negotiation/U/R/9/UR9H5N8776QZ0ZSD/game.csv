"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
