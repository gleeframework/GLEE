"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately way too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this deal work.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better value anywhere else.  Let's make this happen!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 simply won't work for me. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get an excellent deal. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm at $100. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm doing everything I can to make this work. This is my final offer: $140. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. However, if this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal now.",140.0,Alice,7,
