"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting at $200 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. It's a significant markup over my minimum price, but I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value helps establish its worth in Bob's mind. 

**Note:** I'm setting the stage for negotiation, knowing that Bob might counteroffer. I'm prepared to adjust my price depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not worth selling the product at that price, even if it means potentially losing the sale. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to start from a more reasonable point.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and push for a higher price.

I'm confident I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately way too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160 to make this deal work.  This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better value anywhere else.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've moved halfway from my initial offer ($200) to Bob's offer ($80). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive and persuasive:** The message remains positive, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Still above minimum:** $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so it's a win for me if Bob accepts. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell the product at such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob claims it's his final offer, but I have four rounds left. I'm confident I can continue negotiating and push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:**  The fact that John is willing to buy for $150 provides me with a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him closer to my desired price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 simply won't work for me. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get an excellent deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm continuing to compromise, moving from $160 to $130.  This shows I'm actively trying to reach a deal but also that I have a limit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair price"" to make it more appealing and highlight that I'm not just demanding a high price.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing in on $150:** $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity and accept.
* **Prepare for another rejection:** If Bob rejects again, I'm prepared to offer $140 in the next round and potentially accept John's offer if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm at $100. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 remains significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I cannot afford to sell the product at such a loss.
* **Limited time:**  We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I need to be strategic. Selling to John would secure a decent profit, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.
* **John is a fallback:** Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Final counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will make a final counteroffer of $140, emphasizing that it's my last offer before I accept John's offer.
* **Preparing for the final rounds:**  I'm willing to accept John's offer in Round 8 if Bob doesn't budge.  But, I'll use the remaining rounds to try to get as close as possible to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm doing everything I can to make this work. This is my final offer: $140. This price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. However, if this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This counteroffer emphasizes that this is my last offer before I accept John's offer. This adds pressure for Bob to consider accepting.
* **Fairness:** I reiterate that $140 is a fair price, appealing to his sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I mention moving on to another buyer to create a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

* **Close to minimum:** $140 is much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is the highest price I am willing to offer.
* **Accepting John's offer if needed:** If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I will accept John's offer in the next round.

I'm hoping this final offer will convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to move on if necessary."
