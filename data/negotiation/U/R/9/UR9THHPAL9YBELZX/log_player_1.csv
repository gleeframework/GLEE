**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very budget-conscious and unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, continuing the negotiation has a low chance of success and risks losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It's time to secure the sure thing and move on."
