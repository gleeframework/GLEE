"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and the benefits it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, I can start a negotiation and potentially lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now closer to my ideal price, but $825,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target."
