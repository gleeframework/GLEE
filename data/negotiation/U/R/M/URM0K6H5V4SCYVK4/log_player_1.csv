Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I am trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $15,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $8,000. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet a price that reflects the product's value to you.  You've reached your absolute lowest acceptable price, and he's still significantly under. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
