"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
