Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is  a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for bargaining, but also a price that Bob might be willing to accept given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to push for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $87 is close enough to my minimum price of $80 that it's worth accepting. There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or even a breakdown in the negotiations, leaving me to sell to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale for a price that is only slightly below my ideal outcome."
