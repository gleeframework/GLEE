"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. However, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in discussing the price? If not, don't worry; I have another potential buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
