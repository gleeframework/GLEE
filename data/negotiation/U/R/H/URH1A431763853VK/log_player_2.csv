{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a fair price for her, it's above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's a lower price than the first round, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can get her down even further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value our continued discussion, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we are getting closer to finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with paying that much. I want to see if I can negotiate a price closer to my maximum of $800,000 before considering buying from John. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to exhaust all negotiation options before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $925,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring your product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm  committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 still falls short of my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more and come down to $900,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget.  While we've made progress in negotiations, it's getting close to the end of the allotted rounds.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the opportunity to buy from John at my target price of $800,000."
