"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product to me and the cost of purchasing it from another seller if necessary.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
