"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount I'm offering. Let's see if we can close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $875,000? This reflects the value of the product and acknowledges the discount you're seeking.  Let's make this happen!",875000.0,Alice,5,
