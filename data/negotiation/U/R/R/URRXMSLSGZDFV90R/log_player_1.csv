Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price given its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at the maximum price I believe Bob is willing to pay, which is the value he assigns to the product. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price,  hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation and increase the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While I'm starting high, I'm not closing the door on negotiation. The message implies I'm open to discussion if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is a starting point. The negotiation will likely involve multiple rounds. 
* My decision to accept or reject Bob's counteroffer will depend on his offer and the time I want to spend negotiating.
* I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides a safety net in case the negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price and my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Negotiation:** It's too early to accept this offer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price, hopefully encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price.  This will show a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. 
* I will continue to assess the situation and consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge on his price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial price of $1,000,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and presenting the $900,000 price as a fair discount.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to keep the negotiations moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that is more acceptable to me while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* I'm hoping that Bob will see the $900,000 price as a reasonable compromise and be more willing to come up in his next offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts the offer, I'll be happy to close the deal.
* If he rejects the offer again, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or accept the offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount I'm offering. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting the offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price, hoping to encourage further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer, perhaps around $875,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* I will keep the option of selling to John in mind as a safety net. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer."
