It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

How about we settle on $875,000? This reflects the value of the product and acknowledges the discount you're seeking.  Let's make this happen!

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offers, and it's a good price for me.  I'll accept her offer to avoid further negotiation."
