This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good compromise between your minimum and Bob's maximum value. It's also a good starting point for further negotiation if Bob chooses to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value. I am going to reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,100,000? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
