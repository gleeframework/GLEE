Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John since they both offer the same price."
