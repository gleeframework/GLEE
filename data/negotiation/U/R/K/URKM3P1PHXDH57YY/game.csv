"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value proposition more accurately. ",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you're trying to convey, but I still think there's some room for negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that this product will yield an exceptional return for you beyond that figure. How about we settle at $1,190,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and recognizes the product's inherent value.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,190,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000, but I need to feel more confident that this is the best deal I can get. Can you consider this revised offer?",1160000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that.  Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,175,000?  This reflects my final offer, recognizing the immense value this product holds for you.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,165,000, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this revised offer?",1165000.0,Bob,8,
