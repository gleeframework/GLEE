{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we're still above $1,160,000, Bob's offer is getting very close. Holding out for a slightly higher price carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away altogether.  Accepting $1,165,000 guarantees a significant profit above your $800,000 minimum."
