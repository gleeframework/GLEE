"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. My counteroffer is $850,000. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our potential partnership, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price acknowledges your needs while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's make this deal happen!",875000.0,Alice,3,
