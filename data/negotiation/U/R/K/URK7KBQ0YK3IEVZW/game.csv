"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
