"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to accept $125? This would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
