Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer. $175 is a reasonable markup that Bob might consider if he values the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will buy the product at our minimum price. This knowledge gives us more leverage to aim for a higher price with Bob."
