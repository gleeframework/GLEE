{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it and make a small profit, I'm hoping for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 was probably too low. How about we meet in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm confident I can get a better price in the future, but I don't want to risk losing time with Bob. I'll sell to John for $80 and move on."
