"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to you, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
