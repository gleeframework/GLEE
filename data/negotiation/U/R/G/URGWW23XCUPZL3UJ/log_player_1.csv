"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price close to my desired range. I'm also framing it as a fair offer to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $900,000? I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price but showing some willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm serious about the deal and am open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is tempting and getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $890,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still trying to get as much as possible. This is a final offer, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $890000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $880,000 is above my minimum threshold and we're running out of rounds.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid potentially losing out to John."
