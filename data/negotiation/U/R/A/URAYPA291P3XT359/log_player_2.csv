"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price that reflects the product's worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower.  How about $1,250,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gives us room to work with."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to negotiate a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better deal. I'm also mindful that I have limited rounds to close the deal, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  That's a solid price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is within my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I can secure the product."
