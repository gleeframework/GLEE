"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,125. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you get the product at your target price."
