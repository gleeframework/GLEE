"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this better deal with John and save $200,000."
