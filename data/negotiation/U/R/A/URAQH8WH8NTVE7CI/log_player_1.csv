Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider this offer?

While Bob is attempting to negotiate, his offers are too far below the product's value to me. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
