Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

While $1,600,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still closer to my target price with John's offer, and I think I can potentially get a higher offer from Bob if I counter again."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,580,000 is just below my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I can get him to go any higher.  John's offer is a safe bet and guarantees me my minimum price."
