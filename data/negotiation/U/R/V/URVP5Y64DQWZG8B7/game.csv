"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can meet you in the middle at $1050000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. Can you meet me at $975000?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $925000?",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'll make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $975000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other buyers.",975000.0,Alice,7,
