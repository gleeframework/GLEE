Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage with Bob. Aiming higher than $1,200,000 allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage a dialogue and potential negotiation, increasing the chances of a sale at a favorable price. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is the primary objective."
