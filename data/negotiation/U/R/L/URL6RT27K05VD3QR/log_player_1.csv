Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if subjective) can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Urgency:**  Hinting that there's another buyer (John) could encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $125 price point leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her $100 minimum.

By setting the initial offer at $125, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
