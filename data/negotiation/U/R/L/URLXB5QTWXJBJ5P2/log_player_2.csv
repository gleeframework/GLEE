Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling firmness:** Her language (""one more concession"", ""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **The price difference is getting smaller:**  You're at $1,250,000 and your alternative is $1,500,000.  The potential savings are shrinking compared to the risk of Alice walking away.
* **You're still getting a discount:** You're buying the product for $250,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving."
