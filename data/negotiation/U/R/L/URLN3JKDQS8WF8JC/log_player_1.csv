{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $400,000, which is good.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth, which can help you both reach a mutually beneficial price. 

Remember, you always have the option to walk away and sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer. There's room to negotiate a higher price.  By rejecting his offer, you maintain leverage and can counter with a price closer to your initial $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise from your initial offer.
* **Preserves your profit:**  $1,300,000 still gives you a substantial profit of $300,000.
* **Offers a reasonable price:** It's a halfway point between your initial offer and Bob's offer, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit too low for you. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal for you.  It's above your minimum of $1,000,000 and gives you a profit of $250,000.  While you could try to negotiate a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing you to sell to John for a lower amount.  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale."
