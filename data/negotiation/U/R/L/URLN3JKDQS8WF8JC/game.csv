"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit too low for you. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
