Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($12,000) allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High but Appealing:** $11,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it might be tempting enough if he really needs the product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid scaring him off. 
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more attractive to Bob."
