{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's in excellent condition and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for potential negotiation while still ensuring you get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob and try to get a better price.  The next round will allow you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It seems like we're getting closer. How about $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to your desired value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get a better price.  A small counteroffer could be enough to close the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower to meet you in the middle. How about $10,900?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10900}
