{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better price for my product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I think it's best to take it. I'm happy to sell to him for $112.50."
