Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me and $120 to him. This gives us both some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $125. This is a compromise,  I'm coming down from my initial price of $130 but still keeping a profit margin. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer is still below $120.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I will choose to sell the product to him for $120.  It's a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
