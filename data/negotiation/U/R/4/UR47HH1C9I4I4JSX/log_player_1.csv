"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I could make a move up to $725,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, we are in a strong position with John as a backup. We need to push Bob closer to a reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are starting to get into the later rounds of negotiation. This offer represents a significant reduction from our initial offer but still keeps us well above Bob's offers. By stating it as our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to either accept a price closer to our desired range or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I respect your position, but that final offer is still a stretch for me. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product. While we could push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting $800,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
