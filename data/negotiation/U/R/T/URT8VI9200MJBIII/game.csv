"Bob, I'm offering you the product at $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,325,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to keep costs in check for my business.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to keep costs down, but $1,325,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,325,000 and $1,350,000, so I'll offer $1,337,500 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",1337500.0,Bob,6,
