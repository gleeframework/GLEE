{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I believe it's a fair starting point, as Bob values the product at $15,000.  We can then adjust the price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe it's a reasonable price that still allows me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $16,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum and  a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for the $15,000 from John."
