{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $13,000, which is $11,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal at $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm ready to make a deal at $10,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. I'm going to meet you at $10,500, which is the closest I can get to my minimum price of $12,000 without going over. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**
