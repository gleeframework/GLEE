"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth to both of us. How about $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",10750.0,Alice,3,
