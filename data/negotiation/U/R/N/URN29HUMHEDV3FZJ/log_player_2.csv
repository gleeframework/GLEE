"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to take it for $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $170 is higher than your maximum budget of $120 and John's offer of $120. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John directly."
