"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  This allows room for negotiation while still demonstrating the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low for me, and I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This shows flexibility, but also leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a better deal, especially considering Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm continuing to lower the price, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product. Hopefully, this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my minimum with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm hoping that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations."
