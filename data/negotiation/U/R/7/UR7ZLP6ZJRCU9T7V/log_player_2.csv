"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget. This is a bold move, but it establishes a clear baseline and puts pressure on Alice. If she's truly interested in selling, she'll have to come down significantly. If she rejects this, I'll consider adjusting my offer in subsequent rounds based on her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than her initial offer. While it's tempting to accept,  it's worth seeing if we can get even closer to my target price. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my budget. It's a middle ground that could potentially be acceptable to both parties. If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, even though it's lower than the previous rounds. While it's getting closer, it's worth seeing if we can bridge the gap further. If Alice rejects my next offer, I will seriously consider buying from John as we're running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a continued willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget constraints. This is a reasonable midpoint that could be acceptable to Alice, given she's shown a willingness to come down from her initial price. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above my target price, it's getting very close. We're running out of rounds, and with only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product, even if it's not at the absolute lowest price. It's a calculated risk, weighing the potential for a lower price against the likelihood of securing the product before time runs out."
