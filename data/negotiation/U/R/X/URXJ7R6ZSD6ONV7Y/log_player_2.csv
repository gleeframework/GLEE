"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $12,000, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can buy the same product from John for $12,000, which is lower than Alice's offer and within his budget."
