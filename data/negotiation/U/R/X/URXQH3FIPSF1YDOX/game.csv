"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $600,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  How about we settle closer to the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a fair price considering the market value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $810,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $810,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, which is closer to the market value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
