"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $600,000 undervalues its potential significantly.  How about we settle closer to the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a fair price considering the market value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our minimum.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $810,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 810000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $810,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, which is closer to the market value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go above $800,000.  We've reached a point where the potential gain from continued negotiation with Bob is minimal, and there's a risk he'll walk away.  Selling to John for our guaranteed minimum price is the safest and most profitable option now."
