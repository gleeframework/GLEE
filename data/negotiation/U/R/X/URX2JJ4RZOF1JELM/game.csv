"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 falls quite a bit short of that mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
