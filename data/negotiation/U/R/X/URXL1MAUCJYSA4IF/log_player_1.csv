Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's worth $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $78 would be a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $80, $78 is a good deal and higher than my absolute minimum. It's also getting closer to the price John is offering, so there's no point in risking losing the sale for a few extra dollars."
