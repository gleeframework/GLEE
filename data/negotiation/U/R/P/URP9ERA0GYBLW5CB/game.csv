"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
