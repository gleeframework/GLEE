"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  It's too early in the negotiation to buy from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. It's still a good value for both of us, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject the offer.  He can likely get the price lower than $11,000. Buying from John at $15,000 is still a much worse deal than negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would be a good compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and it's likely she won't go any lower. Accepting the offer at $11,250 is a good deal for Bob, considering his $15,000 valuation and the risk of losing the deal to John. It's a significant saving compared to John's price. Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds is not worth it."
