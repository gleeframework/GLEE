Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (You won't sell below this because John guarantees you this amount)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 (He benefits if he can buy it for less)
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $1,499,999 as possible without alienating Bob.  Here's how you can approach it:

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by emphasizing the product's value, framing it positively.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with $1,450,000, you anchor the negotiation high. While still within the ZOPA, it leaves you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the high price (""significant return on investment"") without revealing your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but never below your reservation price). 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more moderate starting price to foster goodwill. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price slightly to secure the deal, but never go below $1,500,000."
