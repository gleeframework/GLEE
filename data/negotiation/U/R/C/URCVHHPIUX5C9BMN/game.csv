"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000.  This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and is within my budget. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value the product brings to your business.
