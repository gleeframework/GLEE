"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 10 rounds and can still make counteroffers. There's a good chance I can get Bob to increase his offer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer without fear of losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price. This reminds Bob that he's potentially getting a good deal.
* **Urgency without Pressure:** I use a phrase like ""let's find a way to make this work"" to create a sense of urgency without putting too much pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $700,000? This would be a good deal for me while still giving you a significant return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** We're still early in the negotiation process (only round 4). I have more room to make counteroffers and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer without fear of losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Not Giving In:** I'm again lowering my price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm only dropping to $800,000, which is still significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Reframing the Offer:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob that he's getting a good deal even at $800,000.
* **""Find Common Ground"":**  This phrase encourages Bob to see the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
