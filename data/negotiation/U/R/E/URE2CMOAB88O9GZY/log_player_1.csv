Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob an incentive to accept. Since you have a strong fallback option, you can be a bit more aggressive.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Confident language:** Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair price"" emphasize the product's value.
* **No mention of John:**  Revealing your backup buyer could weaken your negotiating position.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to reach a mutually beneficial agreement!"
