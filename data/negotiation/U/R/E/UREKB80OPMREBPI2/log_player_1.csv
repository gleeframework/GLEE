Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects a significant price reduction while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
