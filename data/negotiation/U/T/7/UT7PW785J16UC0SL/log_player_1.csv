Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you have room to start high. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique"" nature of the product to justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering at $2,250,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know the product's worth to Bob, we don't know his financial limitations or negotiation style.
* **Risk Tolerance:** Starting high carries the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer. You need to be comfortable walking away and selling to John if necessary."
