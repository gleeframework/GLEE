"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is an attractive offer, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still provides you with significant value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to ensure that this price is reasonable for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still doesn't quite capture the value of this product for your company. Let's compromise at $975,000. This price is fair to both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $975,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 doesn't reflect the product's full potential for your company. Let's split the difference and agree on $950,000. This price is fair for both of us and will enable us to close this deal.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $950,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",900000.0,Bob,8,
