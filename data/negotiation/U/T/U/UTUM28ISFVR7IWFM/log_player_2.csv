"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can do better. He has a clear limit of $10,000 and knows that John is offering the product at that price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** This price is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's closer to his maximum limit but still leaves room for some potential compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob is not going to immediately jump to his final offer of $10,000.  He wants to give Alice some room to negotiate and potentially reach a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than it's worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is closer:** Alice has lowered her price significantly, getting closer to Bob's target price.
* **But still too high:**  However, $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum limit. 
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. A counteroffer will allow him to further lower the price and potentially reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a little over budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  Bob is offering a price halfway between his target of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $11,000. This shows that he's willing to negotiate and compromise.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  $10,750 is still a decent profit for Alice considering her $15,000 valuation. 
* **Pressure to Close:** Bob is demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product and is putting pressure on Alice to accept this offer before he potentially goes with John for $10,000."
