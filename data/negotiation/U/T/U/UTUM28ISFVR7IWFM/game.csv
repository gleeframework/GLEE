"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than it's worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm still a little over budget. I'm willing to pay $10750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for me. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
