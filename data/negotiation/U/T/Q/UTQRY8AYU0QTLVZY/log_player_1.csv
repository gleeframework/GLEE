**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price point that is acceptable.  He's still $100,000 away from my lowest acceptable price, and his incremental increases are getting smaller. This indicates he may not be willing to meet my valuation. Selling to John guarantees I receive the full value I place on the product and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which is looking increasingly unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome."
