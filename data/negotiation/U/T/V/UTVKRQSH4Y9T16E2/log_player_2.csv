"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both our maximum price and John's offer. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 

**Reasoning:** 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a substantial discount.  We want to aim closer to our $120 maximum while keeping in mind that we have John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $135, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $135 is still more than we want to pay and more expensive than John's offer. We'll counteroffer again, moving closer to our limit while signaling that we're getting close to walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $110? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to our maximum price of $120 and John's offer. By stating we're ready to close at $110, we signal firmness while still leaving a small margin for a final counteroffer from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can do $125, which is my final offer. I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $125, which is still more expensive than buying from John. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and we risk missing out on both deals. John's offer of $120 is our guaranteed best price at this point."
