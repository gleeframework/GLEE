Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still ensuring the price is attractive to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, aiming higher with Bob first makes sense to maximize potential profit."
