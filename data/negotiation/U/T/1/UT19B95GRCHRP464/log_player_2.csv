Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget, but it's closer.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You can counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1060000. This is a small increase from your offer, but it's still a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I value this product, $1,060,000 is still a bit higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, demonstrating my desire to acquire this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1037500. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, you're now in round 7, and you only have 3 rounds left.  It's becoming risky to keep negotiating with Alice.  It's more strategic to buy from John at this point. You'll save time and secure the product within your budget."
