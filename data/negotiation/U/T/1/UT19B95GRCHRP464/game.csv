"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1060000. This is a small increase from your offer, but it's still a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I value this product, $1060000 is still a bit higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, demonstrating my desire to acquire this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1037500. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.
