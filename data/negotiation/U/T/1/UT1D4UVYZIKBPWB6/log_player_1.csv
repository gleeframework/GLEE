Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit. I believe the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob sees potential value that justifies a price closer to my ideal.  I'm also aware that I can always back down and sell to John for $800,000 if Bob is unwilling to meet my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I believe the product holds value beyond that, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than that to Bob. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $850,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over his first offer and a good compromise. It's also significantly higher than what I could get from John, making this a favorable outcome."
