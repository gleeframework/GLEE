Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [Product Name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price, even if it's slightly arbitrary. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards (towards your minimum of $1,500,000) during the negotiation process."
