"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds immense value for both of us. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, we believe it's worth exploring a transaction that respects its true worth. Considering its market value and the unique advantages it provides, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This offer not only ensures a fair exchange but also leaves room for negotiation within a reasonable margin. I look forward to discussing this further and hope to facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above the product's worth to her ($800,000). This means there's still room for negotiation, and you could potentially get a better price by rejecting her offer and either:

* Negotiating further with Alice.
* Going with John and potentially getting a better deal from him."
