Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the product's value while still giving you a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price of $8,000.  Since Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  There's a possibility that Alice will agree to a price closer to Bob's ideal."
