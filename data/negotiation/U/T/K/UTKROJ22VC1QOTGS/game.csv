"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me on this.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me though. How about we split the difference at $11,000? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
