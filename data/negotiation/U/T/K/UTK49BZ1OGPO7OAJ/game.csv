"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential. However, I'm working with a tighter budget than I initially expected.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000 and call it a deal?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. Considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
