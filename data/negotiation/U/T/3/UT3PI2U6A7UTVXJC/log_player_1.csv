Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Split the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the potential profit ($120 - $80 = $40) evenly between you and Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** While you could aim higher, this price point makes it very likely Bob will accept, guaranteeing you a significant profit over your minimum."
