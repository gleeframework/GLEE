"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of immense value to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm willing to let you have it for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it seriously.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to see you benefit from this opportunity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
