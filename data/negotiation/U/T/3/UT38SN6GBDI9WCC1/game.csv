"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we start at $10,000?  I think this is a fair starting point for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
