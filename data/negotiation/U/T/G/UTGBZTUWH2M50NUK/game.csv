"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850000 is a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $925000.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $887500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny.  Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,5,
