"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $800,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit below my minimum. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
