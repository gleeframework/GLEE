Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price above $10,000 but I'm lowering it slightly to be more realistic.  Hopefully Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and accept this offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

I will accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm getting closer to my minimum value and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price isn't worth it."
