"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to John for $1500000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
