"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a game-changing asset.",875000.0,Alice,3,
