Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

You should reject Alice's offer.  Although $1,080,000 is closer to your maximum, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 
At this point, Alice has rejected your last offer and is asking for a price of $1,090,000. This is close to your maximum price but still not as good as Jhon's offer of $1,000,000.  It's likely further negotiations will get you a lower price with Alice, but there's also a risk you won't be able to get it for lower than $1,000,000. To be safe and avoid the risk, it's best to buy from Jhon now."
