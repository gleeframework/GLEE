"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $6,000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is already a good discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
