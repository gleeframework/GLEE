Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $6,000 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is already a good discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, it's better to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  While you could try to haggle Alice down further, you risk her raising the price or refusing to negotiate, leaving you stuck with the $8,000 option anyway."
