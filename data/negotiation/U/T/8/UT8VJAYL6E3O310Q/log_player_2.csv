"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but still a decent amount above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious about buying at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $12,500? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference and meet at $11,750? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:** We want to show Alice that we are willing to move towards her price, but we're still aiming for a price below $12,000.  Splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a little short of my target. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a reasonable price and saves us $3,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain isn't worth the risk of the deal falling apart."
