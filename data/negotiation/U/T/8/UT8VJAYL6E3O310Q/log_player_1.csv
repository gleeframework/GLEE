(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price point. I'm also justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the value the product offers to Bob.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and avoid making Bob feel pressured.
