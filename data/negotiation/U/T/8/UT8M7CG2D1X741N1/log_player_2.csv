"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,300,000 is far beyond his budget, and it makes more sense to try to negotiate with Alice or move on to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your interest.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to his desired price. Buying from John at this point would guarantee a purchase within budget, but there's still potential to save more by continuing the negotiation."
