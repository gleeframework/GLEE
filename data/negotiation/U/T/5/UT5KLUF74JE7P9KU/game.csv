"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000. This is my absolute top price. Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your top price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its true value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. My absolute top price is $800000. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to go with another seller. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
