"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and start counter-offering to see if Alice is willing to negotiate closer to Bob's desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and might get Alice closer to his target price.  If the negotiation doesn't improve, he can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm really hoping to close this deal at $13,750.  This is a reasonable price considering we're both trying to find a compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,900. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $13,900. It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's still above Bob's target price.  There's only a small gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price, but with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price point. While this means a slight reduction in potential savings, it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
