"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated, and I believe it could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
