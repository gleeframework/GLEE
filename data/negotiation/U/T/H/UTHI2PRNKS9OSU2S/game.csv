"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To show my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your decision.",890000.0,Alice,5,
