Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows room for negotiation if needed, without going below our minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate and can afford to lose the deal with Bob if he tries to lowball us too much."
