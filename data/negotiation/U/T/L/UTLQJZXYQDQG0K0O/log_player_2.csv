**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $890,000 is still more than I initially wanted, it's a good price considering the product's value and the limited time remaining. It's closer to my target and worth accepting to avoid the risk of a deal falling through or having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John."
