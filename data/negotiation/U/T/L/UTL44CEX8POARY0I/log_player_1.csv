"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price. Would you consider $11,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,200? I think this is a fair compromise considering the original price you mentioned was $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is very close to the halfway point between his initial offer and my original asking price.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting $10,200 is a good profit.
