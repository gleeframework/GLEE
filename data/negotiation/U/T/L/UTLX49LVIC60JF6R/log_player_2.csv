"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it at that price. However, you are looking to save as much money as possible. Since John is also willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, rejecting Alice's offer gives you the option to negotiate with John later or potentially find an even better deal."
