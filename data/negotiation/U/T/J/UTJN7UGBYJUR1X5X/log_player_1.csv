Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to maximize my profit. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer. Hopefully, this will entice him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better deal than continuing to haggle with Bob."
