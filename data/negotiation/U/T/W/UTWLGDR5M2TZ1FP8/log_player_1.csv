"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8750. It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $9,000. I'm hoping to reach a compromise with Bob, but if he isn't willing to budge, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $8,900. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my own needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8900 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8800. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum of $9,000. With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out on the $10,000 offer from John. I'll take the secure option and sell to John."
