"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $9000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8750. It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8900 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8800. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
