"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a significantly higher price than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a multi-round negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a good amount above my minimum, it's still significantly below his own perceived value of the product.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the true potential of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from my initial price to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  However, the decrease is calculated to keep me well above both my minimum and his offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price and potentially shift Bob's perception towards the higher end.
* **Firm but Fair Tone:** The language aims to strike a balance between firmness on price and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. I want to test his upper limit and see if I can secure a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer on the price. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $2,050,000. This is a significant investment on your part, but I truly believe the returns you'll see will far outweigh the initial cost."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  By presenting this as a ""final offer,"" I'm injecting a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Highlighting Value vs. Cost:**  I'm shifting the focus from the price tag to the potential returns on investment, aiming to reframe Bob's perception of the cost.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer represents a small concession from my previous counteroffer, signaling my willingness to find a middle ground while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered the value of your product and my budget constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $2,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my target price of $2,000,000.  While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might walk away in later rounds. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the potential of having to accept John's lower offer."
