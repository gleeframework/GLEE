"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $950000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to him.  I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price. Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but  $1,050,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're still not quite aligned on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now equal to what John is offering.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I've reached a point where the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of continuing negotiations. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
