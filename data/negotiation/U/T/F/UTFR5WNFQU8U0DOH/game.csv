"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specific details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's value far exceeding the asking price. Please let me know your decision. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to purchase it for $800000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
