Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  My offer leaves a small margin for Bob to haggle, making him feel like he's getting a deal if he gets me to come down a bit.
* **Above My Minimum:** This offer ensures that even if I have to negotiate down slightly, I'll still make a significant profit above my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for $1,200,000. This knowledge gives me leverage, allowing me to confidently walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's close, I believe the product holds more value for Bob, and I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll counter-offer to keep the negotiation alive and strive for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is undeniable, and $1,250,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving significantly from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still keeps the price well above my minimum ($1,200,000) and leans closer to my starting price, aiming for a more advantageous outcome.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I'm reinforcing its worth and subtly nudging Bob to recognize its potential for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative.  Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We've reached a point where further haggling might become counterproductive. Bob is clearly interested but also price-conscious.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit now."
