"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is undeniable, and $1,250,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
