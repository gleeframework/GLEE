"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $150 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fair price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I really like the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my finances. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. How about we compromise at $160? It's still a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, Alice, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm trying to be as close to the original price as possible, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is getting close to the original price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer: $135. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",135.0,Bob,8,
