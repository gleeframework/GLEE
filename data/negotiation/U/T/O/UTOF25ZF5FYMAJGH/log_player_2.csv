"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though you could save an additional $50,000 by rejecting Alice and buying from John, the risk is that Alice might retract her offer or another buyer might come along. 
* **The product is still worth more to you than what Alice is asking.**  At $950,000, you are still getting a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you, making it a good deal."
