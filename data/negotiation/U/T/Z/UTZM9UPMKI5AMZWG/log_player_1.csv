Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The offer from Bob is above your minimum price, and you are getting close to the middle ground. It is likely that Bob will not offer more, and you are likely to lose out on a better price if you reject."
