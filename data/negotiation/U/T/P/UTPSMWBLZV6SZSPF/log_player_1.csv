Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees the purchase as beneficial."
