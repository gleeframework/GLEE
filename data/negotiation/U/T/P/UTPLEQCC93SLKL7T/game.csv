"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, at a very attractive price. It's significantly less than what you'd pay elsewhere, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's talk numbers: I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
