"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  It's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to come down a bit. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a discounted price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,050,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
