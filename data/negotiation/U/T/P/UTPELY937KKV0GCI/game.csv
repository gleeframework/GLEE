"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While I understand your budget constraints, the  $700,000 offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still far outside what I can justify. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. I can offer $900,000 as a sign of good faith. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but the value this product brings is still significantly higher.  To meet you closer to your range, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price. I'm still very interested in what you're offering, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
