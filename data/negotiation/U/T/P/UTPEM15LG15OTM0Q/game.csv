"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work towards an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers, and offer you the product for $1,212,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I've already been willing to pay $1,175,000. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
