# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't accept anything less than $1,000,000 from anyone else. However, to give you a chance to secure it first, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
