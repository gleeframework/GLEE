,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
