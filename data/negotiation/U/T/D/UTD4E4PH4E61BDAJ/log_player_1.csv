"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $8,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
