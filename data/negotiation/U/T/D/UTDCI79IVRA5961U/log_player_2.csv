# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not ready to give up on my desired price just yet.

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to her minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and it's not worth the risk of her walking away from the deal. $800,000 is a good price for the product."
