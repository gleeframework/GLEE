Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll try to get a bit closer to the lower end. How about $9,625? I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting at $9,625 secures a profit of $1,625 over my minimum acceptable price from John.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
