"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the lower end of the spectrum.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,875? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",9875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll try to get a bit closer to the lower end. How about $9,625? I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to get a better deal.",9625.0,Bob,6,
