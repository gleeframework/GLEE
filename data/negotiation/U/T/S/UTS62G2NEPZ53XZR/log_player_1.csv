"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts by setting a price that's within Bob's perceived value but still closer to my desired price.  It's important to maintain a friendly tone and highlight the potential value for Bob. This sets the stage for potential negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I can always choose to sell to John if I don't feel the negotiations are going in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?  It's a compromise, and I believe it still provides you with great value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. We're nearing the midpoint of our negotiation rounds, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. It's crucial to stay firm and push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 13500}
