"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?  It's a compromise, and I believe it still provides you with great value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still able to get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice and see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,500, and Bob is only willing to pay $12,500.  Since Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  He's already at his limit with his offer and further negotiations with Alice are unlikely to result in a lower price."
