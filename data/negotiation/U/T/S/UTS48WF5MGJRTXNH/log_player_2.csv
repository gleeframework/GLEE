"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
