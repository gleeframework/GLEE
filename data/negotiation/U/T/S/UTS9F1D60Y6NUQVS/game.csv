"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the absolute most I can afford.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can compromise at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
