"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than I'm actually willing to pay, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This also shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is the absolute most I can afford.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. $11,500 is still within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can compromise at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  She has stated this is her final offer, which means further negotiation is unlikely.  It's better to buy the product from John at $12,000, as this ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that may lead to a worse outcome."
