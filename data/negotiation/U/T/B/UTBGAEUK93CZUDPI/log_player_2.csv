"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me a good profit. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
