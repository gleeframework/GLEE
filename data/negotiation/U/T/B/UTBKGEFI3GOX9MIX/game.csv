"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $800000 is a fair starting point, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is closer but still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $850000.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,4,
