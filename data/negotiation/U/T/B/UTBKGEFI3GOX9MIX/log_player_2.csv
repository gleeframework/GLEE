"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This sets a strong baseline for negotiation and demonstrates my serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $800000 is a fair starting point, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above my ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, so I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer but still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise price, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith and demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching an agreement."
