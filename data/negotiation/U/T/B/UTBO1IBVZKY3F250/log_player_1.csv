Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth the asking price, it implies added value with phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment."" This might pique Bob's interest enough to consider the offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. This knowledge allows you to be bolder in your initial ask."
