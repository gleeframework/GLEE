Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $1,080,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a very fair price, considering the value you'll get out of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,060,000 is still not close to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,070,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you while allowing me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.
