"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while leaving room for you to benefit greatly."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and is closer to my valuation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, but there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter, but John's offer is looking more tempting as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer conveys a sense of urgency while still leaving room for Bob to accept and feel like he got a good deal. 
* **Deadline Implied:**  By stating it's my final offer, it subtly encourages Bob to be more decisive in the next round.
* **John as Backup:** It's good to have John's offer in mind as a fallback if negotiations stall completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $985,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing carries the risk of Bob stalling or the deal falling through. 
* **Strong Offer:** $985,000 is a very good price, significantly exceeding my minimum and John's offer.  
* **Bob's Tone:** Bob's message suggests he's eager to close the deal. Holding out for more might push him away."
