# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
