Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone in the message can encourage Bob to engage in a positive negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value the product holds for Bob might make him more likely to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, leaving the door open for counteroffers.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's still significantly lower.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's room for a higher price, considering Bob's willingness to pay a premium and his statement that he's not willing to go above $1,000,000.
* **Alternative Option:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a guaranteed option, but I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights how the proposed price benefits both of us, making it more appealing for Bob.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message ends with ""Let me know your thoughts,"" leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied. 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation open and maintaining a positive tone."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit far off from what I need. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $940,000?

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $940,000 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $920,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed Higher Price:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a much better deal for me, as it is my minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.

Therefore, it is in my best interest to sell the product to John. While I would have preferred to reach a deal with Bob, his final offer is too low to justify further negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a much better deal with John."
