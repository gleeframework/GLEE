,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a price you're comfortable with and me to get closer to my desired value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still a bit far off from what I need. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $940,000? This would be a good compromise, allowing you to get the product at a slightly higher price than your initial offer while still keeping me closer to my desired value. What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $940,000 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $920,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
