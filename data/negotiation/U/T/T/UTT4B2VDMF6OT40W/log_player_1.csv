I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is far higher than my budget.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800000 for this product.  This is a fair starting point for us to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $800,000 might be a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,200,000? This is a compromise that I think is more in line with the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I'm only comfortable going up to $950000.  This would allow both of us to reach an agreement that's fair and reasonable.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough to reflect the product's value.

This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering our previous discussions and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget.
