"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is far higher than my budget.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800000 for this product.  This is a fair starting point for us to work with.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $800000 might be a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1200000? This is a compromise that I think is more in line with the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I'm only comfortable going up to $950000.  This would allow both of us to reach an agreement that's fair and reasonable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1100000? This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering our previous discussions and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1150000? This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
