"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1400000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? This gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to what I believe the product is worth.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. $1500000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is my final offer, and it's a good opportunity for both of us.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
