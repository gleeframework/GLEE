"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I want to see where his negotiation range is.  I'm also prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm coming down a bit, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I'm also running out of rounds and don't want to risk having to sell to John for the lower price."
