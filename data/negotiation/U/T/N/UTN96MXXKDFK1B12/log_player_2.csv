"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $850000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. This price is a compromise that takes into account your budget while still recognizing the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price,  $950,000 is still above your budget. You have a clear option to get the product for less from John. Continue negotiating with Alice, but be prepared to walk away if she doesn't come closer to your price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to your budget but still higher. You have a solid alternative with John offering the product for $800,000. It's time to take the guaranteed lower price from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
