"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1000000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $850000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while allowing us to close the deal.  Let's discuss this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $850000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000. This price is a compromise that takes into account your budget while still recognizing the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my offer of $850000.  This is a fair price that allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
