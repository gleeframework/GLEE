"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant and $850,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value you see in the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
