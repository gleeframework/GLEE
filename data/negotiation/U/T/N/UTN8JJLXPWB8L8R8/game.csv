"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it leaves room for us both to benefit.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we settle on $1,125,000?  This would represent a significant saving for you compared to the product's true value.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
