The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110. That means there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be happy to purchase it for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice has come down to $100, which is still within my budget and a good price considering the value of the product.  I'll accept her offer."
