This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is below your limit:** $1,162,500 is a significant savings compared to both her initial offer and John's price. 
* **""Final offer"" signals the end:** Alice is indicating she won't go lower. Continuing might make her walk away.
* **Time is a factor:** You're getting close to the 10-round limit, and there's no guarantee of a better deal from Alice."
