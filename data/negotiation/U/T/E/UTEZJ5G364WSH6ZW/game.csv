"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11500 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I've already come down from my initial offer, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
