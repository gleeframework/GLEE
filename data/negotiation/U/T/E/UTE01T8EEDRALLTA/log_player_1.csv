Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still do better.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? It's the highest I can go, but I really think this product would be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get him to budge much more. It's a good deal for me, and it saves me the time and hassle of going back and forth with further counteroffers."
