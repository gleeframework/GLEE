Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is more than fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to maximize profit but also secure a deal with Bob if possible.

Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him, a significant saving.
* **Alice's Perspective:**  Alice makes a profit of $450,000, which is a significant gain compared to letting Bob go and selling to John at $1,500,000.

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept."
