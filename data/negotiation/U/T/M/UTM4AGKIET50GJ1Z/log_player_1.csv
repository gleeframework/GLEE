Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire [product name] at a price below its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as advantageous, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Why this approach is better than offering $1,200,000 directly:**

Offering the product at your minimum acceptable price leaves no room for negotiation and might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal. By starting with a slightly lower price, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer without the need for further negotiation."
