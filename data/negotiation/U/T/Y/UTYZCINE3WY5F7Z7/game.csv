,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit too high. I'm really only able to go up to $10,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
