"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value to me. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
