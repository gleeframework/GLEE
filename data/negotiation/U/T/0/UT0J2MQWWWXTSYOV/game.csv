"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with immense potential. I'm asking for $1,150,000 for it, reflecting its high quality and market value. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While I recognize its value, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
