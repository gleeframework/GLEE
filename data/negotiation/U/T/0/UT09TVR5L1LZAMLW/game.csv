"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a good profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of a price of $15,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $14,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  I'm open to continuing the discussion, but if we can't find a middle ground, I may have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $15,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is already a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
