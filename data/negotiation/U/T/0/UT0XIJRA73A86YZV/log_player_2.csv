"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a generous offer considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or avoid paying more than you need to."
