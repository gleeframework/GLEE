Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still provides significant value to Bob (who values it at $800,000).  
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
