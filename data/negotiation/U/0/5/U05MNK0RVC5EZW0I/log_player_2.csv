"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $140 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is a significant improvement from her initial $180, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but it's still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay right now."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can do $130 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  I've already made two counteroffers and it seems she's not willing to come down to my target price.  Rather than continue negotiating, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $100.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget and saves me further negotiation time."
