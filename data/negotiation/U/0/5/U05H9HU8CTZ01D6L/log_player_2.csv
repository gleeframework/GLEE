"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"", ""product_price"": 65} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer but firmly states that the initial price is too high. 
* **Targeting Savings:**  While we want to save as much as possible, offering something drastically lower than $65 might be too aggressive and discourage Alice from further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price we find acceptable, but we can still try to negotiate further.  We're aiming to stay below our $80 limit, and there's room to meet somewhere in the middle between $90 and our previous offer of $65."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand that you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a good price for both of us, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** By proposing $75, we're demonstrating willingness to compromise while still moving closer to our desired price point. 
* **Justification:** We're subtly reminding Alice that this price benefits both parties.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're still under our $80 limit, but we're getting closer to the point where we might consider John's offer if Alice remains inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $85, which is already above our $80 maximum.  
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** We have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, ensuring we stay within our budget.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging further, ultimately costing us time and potentially missing out on John's offer."
