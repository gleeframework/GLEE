"Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While the product looks promising, that price is a little high for me.  Could we work with a figure closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price below $1,200,000. To be fair to both of us, would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
