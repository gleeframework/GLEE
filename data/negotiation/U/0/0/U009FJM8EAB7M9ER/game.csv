"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",15500.0,Alice,5,
