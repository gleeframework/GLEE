"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $1,800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $2,100,000, so I'd like to offer $1,050,000",1050000.0,Bob,4,
