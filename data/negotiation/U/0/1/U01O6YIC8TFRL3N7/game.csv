"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm offering you a final price of $1,300,000. This is my last offer, and if you decline, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we try $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product, but $1,250,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, given your persistent interest. My final offer is $1,350,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to look elsewhere. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,
