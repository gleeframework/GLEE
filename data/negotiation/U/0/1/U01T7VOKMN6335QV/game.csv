"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,800 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,650? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10650.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,200? This would be a fair price considering the value this product offers you. Let's try to close this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
