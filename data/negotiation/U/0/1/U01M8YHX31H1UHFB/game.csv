"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that 105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for 108. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $108, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about $106?  That's as high as I can go at this point.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 106 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for 109. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",109.0,Alice,5,
