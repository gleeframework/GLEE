Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

There's no point in negotiating further. Alice won't go lower, and John's offer is the same.  It's time to buy!"
