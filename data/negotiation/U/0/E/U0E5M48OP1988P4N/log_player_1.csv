Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $80, aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound."
