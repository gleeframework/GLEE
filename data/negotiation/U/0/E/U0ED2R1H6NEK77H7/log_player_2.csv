"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offering and potentially securing a price closer to Alice's $10,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum value. This signals Bob's willingness to negotiate and establishes a lower starting point for future rounds.  There's a chance Alice might accept, but if not, Bob can continue to adjust his offer strategically."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still sees room for improvement. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to his ideal price of $10,500.  There's still a chance Alice might lower her price further, and Bob is willing to take that chance.  Buying from John for $15,000 is still an option, but Bob wants to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below Alice's latest offer. Bob is hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to decide whether to continue negotiating with Alice or to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and only $200 above Bob's last offer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further or that the remaining rounds might be unproductive.  Accepting the offer secures a good price for Bob and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation."
