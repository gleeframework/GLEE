Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $8,000.

Offering a price of $10,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Profitable for Alice:** $10,000 is a $2,000 profit over her minimum.
* **Good Deal for Bob:** Bob saves $2,000 compared to his valuation.

This strategy seeks a win-win situation, maximizing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
