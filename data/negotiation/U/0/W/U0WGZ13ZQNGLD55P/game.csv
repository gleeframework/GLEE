"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm counteroffering at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, it seems like we are getting close.  How about we meet in the middle at $120 and close the deal?",120.0,Bob,6,
