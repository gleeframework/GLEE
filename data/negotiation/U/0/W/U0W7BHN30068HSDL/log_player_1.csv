Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if Bob proves unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John at that price guarantees my desired outcome.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I can afford to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to reflect your interest, but I can't go any lower.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a reason and a counter-offer that shows I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise but Not Surrender:** $1,100,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit and is closer to my desired price point. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us, framing it as a collaborative effort.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while holding firm on my minimum acceptable price. It also signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but won't be easily taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and unproductive.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired outcome and eliminates the risk of a prolonged and potentially fruitless negotiation."
