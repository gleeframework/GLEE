"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves plenty of room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
