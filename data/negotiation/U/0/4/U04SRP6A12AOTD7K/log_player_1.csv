{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You value the product at $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It sets a clear price point:**  By offering a specific price, you encourage Bob to respond with either acceptance or a counteroffer, moving the negotiation forward. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that is both attractive to Bob and profitable for you. By carefully considering your options and understanding Bob's perspective, you can maximize your chances of selling the product at a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm still paying a significant premium. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit, and it's still well below your asking price. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him further."

Bob's offer:

While $910,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I reach my desired value and avoid the risk of Bob continuing to bargain."
