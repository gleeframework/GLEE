You can still try to get a lower price from Alice.  You've already gotten her down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. Another counteroffer might be able to bring the price closer to your goal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000.

It's time to stop negotiating with Alice. You've gotten her down to $1,020,000, but you're unlikely to get her lower than $1,000,000. Buying from John saves you the risk of Alice rejecting your next offer."
