"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $92.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",92.5,Alice,5,
