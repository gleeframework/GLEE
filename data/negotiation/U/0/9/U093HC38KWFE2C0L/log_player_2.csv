"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your target of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have a backup plan, but you should try to save money by negotiating with Alice first."

Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work involved.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target of $1,500,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to negotiate, and you can try to get a price closer to your target.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have a backup plan, but you should try to save money by negotiating with Alice further."
