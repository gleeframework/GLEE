"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
