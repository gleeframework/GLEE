,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. Let's make this deal happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my last offer before I have to consider other buyers.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand the market is competitive, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000,  which is a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
