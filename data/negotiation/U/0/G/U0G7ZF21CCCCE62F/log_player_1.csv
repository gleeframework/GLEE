Round 2

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to try and negotiate further with him than to settle for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can find common ground."
