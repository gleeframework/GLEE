"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but he seems motivated to make a deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $887,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go back to my initial thought and offer $850,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm not comfortable with selling for $850,000, so it's time to cut my losses and move on to John.  At least I'll still get my minimum price."
