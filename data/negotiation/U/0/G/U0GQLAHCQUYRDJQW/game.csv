"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $887,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go back to my initial thought and offer $850,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can meet me halfway",850000.0,Bob,6,
