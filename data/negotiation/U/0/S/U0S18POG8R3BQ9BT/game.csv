"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you moving towards my price range. How about we settle at $760,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
