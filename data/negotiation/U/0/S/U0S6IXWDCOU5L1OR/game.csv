"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product but I can only go up to $12000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, so I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is my final offer, let me know if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $13000, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $14500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
