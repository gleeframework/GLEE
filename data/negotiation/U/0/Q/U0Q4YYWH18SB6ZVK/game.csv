"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at significantly more than $15000, I'm willing to make a concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see your offer is moving in the right direction. However, I am still firm on a price closer to my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",17500.0,Alice,5,
