"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the price further. ",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider. This product offers unique value that I believe justifies a much higher price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a substantial concession, and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, $2,100,000 is not within my budget. I can go up to $900,000.  I believe this offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a fair return.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I must be transparent: $900,000 is too far from where I need to be to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. While $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $1,350,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
