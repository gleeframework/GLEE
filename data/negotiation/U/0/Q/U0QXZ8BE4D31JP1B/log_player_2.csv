Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider. This product offers unique value that I believe justifies a much higher price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a substantial concession, and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I must be transparent: $900,000 is too far from where I need to be to make this deal work. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.
