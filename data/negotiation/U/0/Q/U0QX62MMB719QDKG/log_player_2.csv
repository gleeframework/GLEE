"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant gap between Alice's valuation ($800,000) and her offer, indicating room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, there's still room for negotiation.  The $900,000 offer is still significantly above Alice's valuation, meaning there's potential for a better deal. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to his desired range."
