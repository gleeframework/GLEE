"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for the same price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product, and Alice is offering it at $100. There's no benefit to accepting her offer. By rejecting, you can buy the same product from John for the same price."
