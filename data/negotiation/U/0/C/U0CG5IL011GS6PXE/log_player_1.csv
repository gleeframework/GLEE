Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but it's still a significant profit for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price if necessary."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm going to counter with $875,000. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still less than my initial goal, it's getting closer. We're now only $40,000 apart.  I'm confident that we can close this deal quickly, and I don't want to risk losing out on this sale by continuing to negotiate."
