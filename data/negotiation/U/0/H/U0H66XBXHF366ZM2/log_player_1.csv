I'm not willing to settle for $750,000 just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm prepared to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000?  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can still negotiate further. Based on my research and budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $825,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired value.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing out on the deal."
