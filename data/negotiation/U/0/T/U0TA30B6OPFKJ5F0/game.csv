"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $15000 for it. Considering my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a price of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12500.

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I still feel that $12500 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a price of $11000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. I hope this meets your expectations.",11000.0,Bob,4,
