"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way above what I'm looking to spend. This product would be useful, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand that $14,000 is a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $7,500, but that's my limit.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $9,000 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,000.  I'm willing to make one last offer of $8,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
