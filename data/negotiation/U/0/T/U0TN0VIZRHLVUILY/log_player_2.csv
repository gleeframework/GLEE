"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's far above your maximum budget and significantly more than what John is offering.  You should counter with a much lower offer to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way above what I'm looking to spend. This product would be useful, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, it's important to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a low offer, you're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room:**  You've left yourself space to increase your offer in future rounds if Alice completely rejects this initial counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand that $14,000 is a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but $10,500 is still above both your budget and John's offer. It's clear you need to nudge the negotiation further down. You have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $7,500, but that's my limit."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing your offer, but you're doing it in a controlled manner.
* **Setting a Limit (and Meaning It):**  By stating ""$7,500 is my limit,"" you're creating a sense of urgency and indicating that you're serious about your budget.  
* **Still Below John:** It's important to remember that John will sell the product for $8,000. While you want to try to get the best deal from Alice, don't be afraid to walk away if the price doesn't meet your needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $9,000 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try and force your hand. It's important not to cave under pressure.
* **Still Above Budget:** $9,000 is closer, but it's still above your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. 
* **One Last Push:** You can try one more counteroffer to see if you can get Alice closer to $8,000. If not, John is your best alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,000.  I'm willing to make one last offer of $8,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're now mirroring Alice's ""final offer"" approach, making it clear this is as high as you'll go. 
* **Meeting Your Limit:** $8,000 is your absolute maximum budget, and it matches what John is offering. 
* **Prepared to Walk:** By mentioning you'll ""consider other options,"" you emphasize that you're willing to walk away from the deal if Alice doesn't budge."
