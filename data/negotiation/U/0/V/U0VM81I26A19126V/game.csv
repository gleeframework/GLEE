"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, considering its value to my business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth $1100000. However, I'm still limited to $950000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1075000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints.  Let's finalize this deal at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to meet you at $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and dedicated support for the product. I believe this is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but $1075000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which would include those extras. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I truly believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. It's a fair price for the extras you are adding, and I believe we can close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to add one more condition. I'll throw in a personalized onboarding session to ensure you get the most out of the product. This will be a valuable addition to the 2-year warranty and dedicated support I previously offered. I believe this is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
