"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, given its potential benefits. This is a fair price, and I believe it would be mutually beneficial for us to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1300000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1700000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move forward with the deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1450000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalize the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1450000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
