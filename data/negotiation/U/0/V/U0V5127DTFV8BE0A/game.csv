"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I'll still get a good return. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective on market value, but this product is unique and holds a higher value for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $1,150,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can accept.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not able to accept $1,075,000.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,125,000 is the lowest I can go. This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll meet you at $1,100,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept this price, I'll make the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
