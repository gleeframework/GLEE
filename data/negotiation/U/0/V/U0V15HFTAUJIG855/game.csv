"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Bob,4,
