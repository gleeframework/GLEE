"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, leaving room for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate and can likely get a lower price. While $11,500 is closer to his target, he wants to save as much money as possible. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and has several rounds left.  He's already managed to get Alice down from $12,000 to $11,750, demonstrating progress.  There's still room to negotiate a slightly lower price, and Bob should continue pushing for it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $11,250.  Let's close this deal and save some money for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $11,500 is her final offer.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he's already gotten a significant discount from the original price.  If he rejects the offer, he risks Alice walking away or potentially making a counteroffer that's less favorable. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's better to secure the product at this price.  He's also saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
