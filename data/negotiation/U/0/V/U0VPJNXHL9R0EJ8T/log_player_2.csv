"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so she is willing to sell it for a price closer to that amount.  $900,000 is too high, and there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counter-offer that could lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your stated value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still a good deal for me. It's well below my maximum price of $1,500,000 and significantly less than her initial offer of $900,000.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
