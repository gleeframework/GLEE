"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still willing to work with you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stick to my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm getting close to my minimum, so I'm going to make one more serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your final offer, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 even though it stretches my budget. Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm flattered that you're willing to stretch your budget to $1,000,000, but I've already told you that's my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession. I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. But the price remains the same: $1,000,000. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
