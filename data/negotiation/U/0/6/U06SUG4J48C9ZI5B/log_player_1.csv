Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my target, I still feel like I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly closer to my ideal, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $10,125.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,900? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,900 is getting closer to my goal, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk going through another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000, I'm going to take that option and sell to him."
