"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum price of $100.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $103. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $107. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",107.0,Alice,7,
