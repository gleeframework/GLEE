# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  However, I'm always open to discussing terms and finding an arrangement that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $800,000. It's essential to negotiate and try to bring the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I see you're serious about this product.  While $900,000 is still below my target, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,100,000.
