"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This is a fair price, considering the value the product offers, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still slightly above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a good price for both of us, allowing for a quick and mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
