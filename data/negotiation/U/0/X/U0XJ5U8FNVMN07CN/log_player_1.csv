Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

This strategy aims for a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
