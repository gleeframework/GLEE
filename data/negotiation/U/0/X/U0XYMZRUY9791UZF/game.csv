"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,750 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,125? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal.",13125.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,125. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some extras that will increase the value of the product. I'll sell it to you for $13,500, and I'll include a one-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal on a fantastic product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while the warranty and maintenance are tempting,  $13,500 is still above my budget. Let's try to stay focused on the product itself.  I'm willing to meet you at $13,000.  This is a fair price that would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my limit.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already given you a great deal by including the warranty and maintenance package. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the extras. I'll sell it to you for $13,250, and I'll throw in an additional service to make it worth your while.",13250.0,Alice,7,
