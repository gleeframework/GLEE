"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Consider the long-term benefits it offers and the competitive edge it provides.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
