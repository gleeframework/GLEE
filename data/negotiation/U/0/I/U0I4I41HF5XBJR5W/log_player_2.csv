"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be really interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to let it go for $120 to you. Let me know if that sounds good! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum and a significant savings compared to buying from John."
