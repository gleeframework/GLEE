"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. It's a reasonable price point considering Alice's valuation of $1,500,000 and Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on her price, which is good. However, Bob can still try to get a better deal. He's already shown that he's willing to walk away, so there's leverage to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a strong position.  Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and he's already demonstrated his willingness to walk away.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest one.  It shows he's serious about closing the deal, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is getting closer to Bob's desired price range. While he could continue negotiating, it's getting risky. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob needs to weigh the chance of getting a better price against the possibility of missing out on the deal completely.

Accepting this offer gives Bob a good deal: he saves $150,000 compared to John's offer and leaves room for potential future profit if the product's value increases."
