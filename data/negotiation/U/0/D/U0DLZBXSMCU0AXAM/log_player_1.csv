"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible outcome. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I want to maximize my profit.  Bob might counter, but we have 10 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to squeeze a little more out of him, the risk of him walking away or going through multiple rounds is not worth it. It's better to secure the $15,000 now and avoid potential complications."
