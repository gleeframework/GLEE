Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value ($800,000). 
* This gives me a chance to get a better price than John's offer.
* I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a good compromise.

**Next steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response. 
* If he accepts, I've made a successful sale.
* If he rejects, I'll move on to selling to John."
