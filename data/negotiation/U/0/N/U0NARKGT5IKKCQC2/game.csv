"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I believe you'll gain from it.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground: How about $925,000? This reflects a compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what you're gaining.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top end of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
