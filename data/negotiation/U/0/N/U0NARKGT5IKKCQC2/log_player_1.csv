Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
We're aiming much higher than $600,000! It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I believe you'll gain from it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

We're getting closer, but we can still try to push for a bit more before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground: How about $925,000? This reflects a compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute top end of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good spot to accept. We've negotiated well, and Bob is at his maximum budget. Taking any more time with counteroffers risks losing the sale, and John won't give us a better price."
