Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
