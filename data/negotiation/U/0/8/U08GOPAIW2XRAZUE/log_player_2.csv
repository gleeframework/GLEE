"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer allows him to attempt to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $7,500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $7250. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $7,250 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price before potentially resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for $7,100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 7100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going below $7200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7100 and $7200. How about we settle at $7150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,150, which is very close to Bob's target of $7,100.  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
