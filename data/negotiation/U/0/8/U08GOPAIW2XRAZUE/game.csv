"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $7500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $7250. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7250 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for $7100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away satisfied with the deal.",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going below $7200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7100 and $7200. How about we settle at $7150?",7150.0,Alice,5,
