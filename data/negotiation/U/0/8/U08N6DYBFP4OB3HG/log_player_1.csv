Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is lower than the $15,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have some space to negotiate before reaching your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly below your ideal price.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the opportunity to counter and try to push for a higher price closer to your desired $14,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, you can counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $13,000 but lower than your initial offer. This demonstrates you're willing to compromise while still protecting your interests."
