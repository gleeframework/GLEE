Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to remember that:

* **This is a negotiation:**  The goal is to maximize your profit, but that doesn't mean starting at the highest possible price. Starting too high might scare Bob away.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed $150 from John gives you leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can confidently walk away. 
* **Understanding Bob's value:** Bob's value for the product is $80. This means he's unlikely to pay more than that, but you have room to negotiate within that range. 
* **Be polite and professional:** A good relationship with Bob might lead to future transactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. I hope this offer suits you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. You have a guaranteed $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  

You can use John as leverage in your counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, $90 is significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a realistic price:**  $120 is a significant step down from your initial price but still leaves you with a decent profit. 
* **Highlight the value:**  You remind Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the fairness of your offer.
* **Offer a compromise:**  You are signaling your willingness to negotiate, but also showing you have a limit. 
* **Be professional and friendly:** This maintains a good rapport in case Bob doesn't accept this offer, but is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $105 for the product. I hope this offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is closer to your desired price, it's still not enough. Remember, you have a guaranteed $150 from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:**  You can try to push for a price closer to $120.
* **Maintain leverage:** By showing you're not desperate, you increase the chances of Bob coming closer to your desired price. 

This is a gamble, but it could pay off. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will let you get the product you need.  Let me know if you're interested, or we can call it a day."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** You present this as a ""final compromise"" to signal your willingness to negotiate while maintaining a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** You reiterate the fairness of the price, ensuring it's acceptable to both parties.
* **Decision time:** You give Bob a clear choice: accept the offer or let the deal fall through. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You remain open to closing the deal, but still have the option of selling to John if necessary.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to your desired price while leaving the decision in his hands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your final offer. I understand your position, and I am willing to pay $110 for the product. I hope this offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still below your minimum of $115.  Given that you have a guaranteed $150 from John, it's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing other opportunities. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees you a higher profit. 
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  Bob might not be willing to budge further, leading to a potential deadlock.

While it's tempting to try and squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the certainty of selling to John for a better price outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation."
