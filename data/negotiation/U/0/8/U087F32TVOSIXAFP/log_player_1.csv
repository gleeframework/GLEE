Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I will either:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:** If he makes a reasonable offer closer to my minimum.
    * **Reject his counteroffer:** If he offers significantly less than my minimum.
    * **Make a counteroffer:** If he offers a price that's too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price.

* **John's Option:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls or if he offers a price below my minimum, I'll switch to John and sell for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000. It's not even close to what the product is worth to me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product, which means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** It's in my best interest to try and get a better price from Bob, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This will show a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. Would you consider $10,500? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find the product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that it's a good investment for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging, hoping to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:** If he offers a price closer to my minimum.
    * **Reject his counteroffer:** If he offers significantly less than my minimum.
    * **Make a counteroffer:** If he offers a price that's too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but I'll be mindful of my minimum.
* **John's Option:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls or if he offers a price below my minimum, I'll switch to John and sell for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is only $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a very small difference, and it's worth considering.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely. It's possible that I might not be able to get a better price from him, or he might decide to go with another seller altogether.
* **John's Option:** While John is offering a higher price, there's no guarantee that he won't back out or lower his offer in the future.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Offer:** I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,250. This ensures a sale and provides a reasonable profit."
