"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $110 is close to your budget, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and you can likely get a better price by countering.  You have the security of buying from John at $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to your target while still leaving room for negotiation. It also signals to Alice that you're serious about buying but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $95 is a good price, falling well within your budget and saving you $5 compared to buying from John. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you risk losing the opportunity for a deal if you push further."
