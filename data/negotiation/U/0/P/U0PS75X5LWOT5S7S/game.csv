"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
