"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
