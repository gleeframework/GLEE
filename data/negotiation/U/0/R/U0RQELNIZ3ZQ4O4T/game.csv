"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Could you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
