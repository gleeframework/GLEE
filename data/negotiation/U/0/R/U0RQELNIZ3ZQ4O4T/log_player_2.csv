""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Could you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. She has drawn a line in the sand stating ""$8,500 is the lowest I can go"".  You can continue negotiating, but it's risky. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
