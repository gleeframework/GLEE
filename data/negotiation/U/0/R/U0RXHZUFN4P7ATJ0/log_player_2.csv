"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is a bit lower than Alice's value, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it to you for $80, so it makes sense to try and get a better deal from Alice first."
