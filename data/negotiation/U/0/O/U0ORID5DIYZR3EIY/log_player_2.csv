"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm very interested in this product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? That's my maximum budget for this purchase."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, hoping Alice might be willing to come down closer to Bob's offer. There's still time to make a counteroffer and explore a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $14,000? It's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is your absolute highest offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There's still a chance to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down to a price within Bob's range.  It's better to try one more counteroffer than risk going to John and paying $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15,500 is closer, but I'm still at my limit. If you could come down to $14,500, I'd be happy to accept. This is truly my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to accept $14500. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $15250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has rejected Bob's counteroffer, and it's getting very close to Bob's maximum. It's getting increasingly likely that further negotiations will fail to reach a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, with only a few rounds left, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John. He's guaranteed to get the product for $12,000, which is within his budget, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
