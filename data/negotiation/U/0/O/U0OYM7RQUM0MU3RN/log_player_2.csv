"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

The product is worth $80 to you. Alice is offering it for $80.  You can get it from John for the same price, so there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to buy from John, which is the same outcome but gives you more flexibility."
