Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small chance Bob might accept it outright. Even if he tries to negotiate, you have some buffer to come down slightly in price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high (e.g., $150) might discourage Bob from even countering. The message aims to make the price seem more appealing."
