"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me.  This allows for some negotiation room while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm also keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe there's still room to reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,500?  This way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept.  I want to see if I can get closer to my original target price.  I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's meet in the middle at $12,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 12200}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price. I have a few rounds left, so I still have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's make a final compromise and go with $12,100.  I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, so I'm being as flexible as I can."", ""product_price"": 12100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,100. I'm willing to pay $11,900 for the product, and I think that's a fair price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting very close to my minimum, but we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, and it's better than risking a lower price with Bob."
