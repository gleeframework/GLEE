{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob can get a better deal from John. However, it's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for the lowest possible price, which is $800,000. This counteroffer is the lowest he's willing to go.  While it's likely Alice will reject this offer, it establishes Bob's bottom line and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob can get a better deal from John for $800,000. However, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's willing to go slightly higher than his initial offer, but he's still trying to get a better price than Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer shows he's serious about negotiating but isn't willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price. While it's still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, it's close enough to be a worthwhile deal. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and Bob is already within his budget. Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it secures the product without risking losing the opportunity to another buyer."
