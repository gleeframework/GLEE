"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and highly valuable product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500001. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to convince you with ""exclusive"" and ""one-time"" offers, the price is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John. You can always reject Alice's offer and still get the product for less from John."
