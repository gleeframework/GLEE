The offer from Bob is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it is still an indication that he is a serious buyer. It is worth attempting to negotiate further."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,275,000 at this point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm concerned that he's not willing to come up enough to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000."
