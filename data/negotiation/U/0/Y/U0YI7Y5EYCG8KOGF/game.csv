,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is my absolute minimum.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but $1,212,500 is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.  ",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer. Let's meet at this price or I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
