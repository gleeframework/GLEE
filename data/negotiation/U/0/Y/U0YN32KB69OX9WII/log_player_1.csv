Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $97.5 is closer to my ideal price, it's still not enough. I'll make one more counteroffer and if he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
