I'm confident you'll appreciate its potential.  My asking price is $1200000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
