"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which we believe could greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $950000. We are confident this is an excellent opportunity for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, the price of $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of our product and your interest, we would like to counter with an offer of $900000. This is a more reasonable midpoint between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming for a win-win situation for both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to meet in the middle once again. Our counteroffer is $887500. We believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also being competitive with your offer.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $887500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $870000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and ensure both of us walk away with a good deal. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",870000.0,Bob,6,
