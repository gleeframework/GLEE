"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,080,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,070,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1070000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but $1,065,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,070,000, which is a fair compromise, considering how much you value this product.  I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
