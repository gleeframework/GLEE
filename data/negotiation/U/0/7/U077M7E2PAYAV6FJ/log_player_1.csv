Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm offering $16,000 as a counteroffer. This is still a good price for me, while also being a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to reach a price we can both agree on.  If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm offering $14,500. This is my final counteroffer. I believe this is a fair compromise,  close to my minimum, but also a good deal for Bob considering his initial offer. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum, and I don't want to risk going back and forth any further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value, and it saves time and effort on further negotiations."
