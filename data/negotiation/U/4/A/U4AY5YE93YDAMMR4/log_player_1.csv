"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation room while also setting a clear expectation of the value I see in the product. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a fair price considering my budget and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price, especially with 8 rounds remaining. I'm willing to counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. It's a fair price considering my constraints and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm aware of my time constraints, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm rejecting his offer to continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a significant savings for you compared to my initial offer. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I can secure a better price. Given the time constraint and the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This secures a decent profit and avoids further potential losses during negotiation."
