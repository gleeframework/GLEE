Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiations. This reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer matches John's offer, and there's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures the known value."
