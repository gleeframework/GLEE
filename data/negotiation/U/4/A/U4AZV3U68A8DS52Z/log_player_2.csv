"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget.

This reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my budget. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my target.  I have 7 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
