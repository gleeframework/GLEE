"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? Let's get this deal done!",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking of a price around $875,000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $900,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final concession.  $893,750 is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying this product, this is our last chance to make a deal. ",893750.0,Alice,7,

"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",890000.0,Bob,8,
