Round 8
Bob's offer:

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to my minimum threshold and I'm running out of time. To ensure I don't lose out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking losing the deal altogether with Bob."
