"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a counteroffer of $10,500.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of offering you a counteroffer of $10,400. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
