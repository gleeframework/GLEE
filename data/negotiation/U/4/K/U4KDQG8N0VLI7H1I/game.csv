"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is still a fair price considering your own valuation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still above my target price. To move forward, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This offers a good compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
