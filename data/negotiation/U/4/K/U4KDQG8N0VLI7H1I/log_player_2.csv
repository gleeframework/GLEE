"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers.** This gives Bob the chance to lower the price and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counter-offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to her.  This indicates there's still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  Bob can try to get the price even lower with another counter-offer."
