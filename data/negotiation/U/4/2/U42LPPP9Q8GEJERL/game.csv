"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $2000000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something we can work with?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little to $1750000. This would allow me to cover my costs and still offer you a good deal.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $1500000 for the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to accept John's offer.  Would you be willing to increase your offer to $1450000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $1400000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
