"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profits.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I use language that suggests I'm open to negotiation (""Let's see if we can come to an agreement"") to avoid appearing inflexible.

**Important Note:** I'm balancing the need to maximize my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and Bob is offering the minimum. While I could accept and move on, I believe there's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the upper hand in the negotiation as I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer in the next round with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little to $1,750,000. This would allow me to cover my costs and still offer you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer.
* **Maintain Value:** The counteroffer still keeps the price above my minimum threshold.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I use language that suggests I'm still open to further discussion (""What do you think?"")

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and avoiding a stalemate with Bob. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I can still potentially reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean taking a loss on the product.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While I'm aware of John's offer, I'm not ready to sell just yet. There's still potential for Bob to come up with a higher offer. 
* **Leverage John's Offer:**  I'll use John's offer as leverage in the next round to push Bob towards a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, emphasizing John's offer to show Bob that I have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to accept John's offer.  Would you be willing to increase your offer to $1,450,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I explicitly mention John's offer to show Bob that I'm not desperate and have other options. This adds pressure to Bob to increase his offer.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise ($1,450,000) to show good faith and willingness to negotiate, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Fair Price:** I frame the offer as a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:

* Encourage Bob to increase his offer due to the pressure of John's offer.
* Keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price.
* Avoid selling to John yet, as I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $1400000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with anyone is increasing.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price and avoid any potential losses.

**Strategy:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that he will budge.  I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed sale to John to avoid risking a stalemate and potentially ending up with no sale at all."
