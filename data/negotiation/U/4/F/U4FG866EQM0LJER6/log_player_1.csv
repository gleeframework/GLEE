{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $11,500 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.

This strategy aims to find a compromise that maximizes your profit while still making the deal appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your ideal price and leaves less room for negotiation. You can likely get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's close to what I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to your desired price than John's offer of $10,000.  While it's still below your ideal, accepting this offer ensures a higher profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
