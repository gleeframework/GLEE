"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's close to what I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
