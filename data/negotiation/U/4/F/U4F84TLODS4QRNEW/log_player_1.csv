Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have valuable information: the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Aiming High, but Realistically:** Starting with a high offer of $1,300,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Justification:** Framing the price around the ""value"" and ""benefit"" to Bob makes it more palatable than focusing solely on your own costs or John's offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be aware that pushing too hard might make Bob walk away."
