"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice. $140 is close to my limit, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a price I'm happy with.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while also expressing my budget constraints. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $110, I'm aiming for a price that's a good deal for me but also potentially acceptable to Alice since it's still above her perceived value of the product ($120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still a bit high. I'll try to meet her closer to the middle ground between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 is probably a bit low. How about we split the difference and do $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $120, I'm offering a compromise that's exactly halfway between my last offer and her current one. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a fair deal. 
* **Reaching Alice's Value:** $120 is the price Alice values the product at. While she might ideally like to get more, it's a strong offer that she might accept to avoid further negotiation or losing the sale. 
* **Staying Below My Limit:** This offer still keeps me comfortably below my $150 maximum budget."
