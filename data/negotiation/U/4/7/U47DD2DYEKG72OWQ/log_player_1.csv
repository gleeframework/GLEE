"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves me with a considerable profit.  I believe this offer is enticing enough for Bob to consider, but allows room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,000,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still ensuring a substantial profit. This price is likely to be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have four rounds left, and with each round, Bob is getting closer to my desired price point. I believe I can secure a price closer to $1 million with a few more negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight concession, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.  We're close to a deal now, and this offer might be just what it takes to seal the agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating. With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic and push for a higher price point.  I'm not ready to settle for less than my target."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. We are nearing the end of negotiations, and I believe this offer is close enough to his perceived value to make him accept.  It also ensures me a decent profit, considering I have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to settle. I'm going to counter again, hoping to get close to my target before we run out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final push for a price I'm comfortable with.  $940,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it is likely to be accepted by Bob, as we are both getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his final counteroffer, as I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally want a bit more, this offer is close enough to my goal and it's the last round.  It's better to secure a decent profit than risk losing the deal altogether."
