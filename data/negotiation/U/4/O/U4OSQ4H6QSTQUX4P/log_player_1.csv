"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value to me. I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me more leverage in the first round.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and persuasive message encourages Bob to consider the offer without immediately feeling like he's being pressured. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob is a subtle way of reminding him of the potential benefits. 

**Note:**  This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations. I also have the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob aren't promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does signal that he's willing to negotiate. This gives me a chance to counter and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, but continuing the negotiation with Bob has the potential to get a higher price.  I'm willing to take that risk in this round.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my value but still acknowledges his willingness to negotiate. I'll aim for a price that's somewhere between my minimum and his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with $800,000. This price reflects the product's worth while giving you a significant advantage over its market value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming for a price between my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($600,000). This signals flexibility and a willingness to find common ground. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to both of us, emphasizing the benefits Bob will gain at this price.
* **Strategic Approach:** This counteroffer is a test. If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, it will give me information about his bottom line for future negotiations."
