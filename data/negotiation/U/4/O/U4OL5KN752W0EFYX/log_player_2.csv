Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $118. I'm willing to meet you at $122, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $122.  You've made it clear that you're trying to stay under $120. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $120 than risk Alice not budging further."
