"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I'm looking to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for it.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to get at least $125 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and quality.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $118. I'm willing to meet you at $122, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise.",122.0,Alice,7,
