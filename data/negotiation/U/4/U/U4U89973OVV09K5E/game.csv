"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $1,200,000, I can come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the reduction, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,500,000. That's the highest I can go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
