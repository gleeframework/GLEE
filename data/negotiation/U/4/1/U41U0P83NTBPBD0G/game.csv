"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
