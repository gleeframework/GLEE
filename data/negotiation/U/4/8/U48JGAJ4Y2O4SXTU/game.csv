"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for the product?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $142 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase it right away.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $142 and $135, so I'll offer you $138.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with it.",138.5,Alice,5,
