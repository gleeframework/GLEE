"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,500,000, there's room to bargain. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, while still being a reasonable price that is lower than Alice's minimum. It shows that I am serious about buying the product, but also that I am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This strategy will encourage Alice to negotiate and potentially lead to a deal that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap. There's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,370,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that is only $70,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, I'm close to my desired range. Accepting her offer at this point is a good compromise.  It saves me $130,000 compared to buying from John, and ensures I get the product. Further negotiation could result in a lower price, but it also risks the deal falling through entirely, potentially leading to me having to buy at John's higher price."
