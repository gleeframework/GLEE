"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and meet at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
