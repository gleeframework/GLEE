"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $10000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
