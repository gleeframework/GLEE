Alice's offer:

While $8,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still a bit higher than I want to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice has come down to her lowest price, and $8,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the product."
