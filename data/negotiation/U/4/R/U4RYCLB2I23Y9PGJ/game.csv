"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I'm interested, $8,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer you $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $7,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
