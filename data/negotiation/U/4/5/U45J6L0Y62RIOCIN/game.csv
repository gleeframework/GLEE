"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're coming down in price, which I appreciate. While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a more reasonable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer! $1,150,000 is definitely an improvement. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I believe this price is fair considering our negotiation progress and the product's value.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
