This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's also a better deal than selling to John right now."
