Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I value your time and appreciate your continued interest. However, $1150000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1200000.  I'm offering $1225000 as a final compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.
