"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value your time and appreciate your continued interest. However, $1150000 is still not a price that works for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1200000.  I'm offering $1225000 as a final compromise. Let's close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
