Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum, so you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  This leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could make Bob walk away immediately. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is tempting, it's important to remember that the product is worth $15,000 to him. There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, we can try to get a price closer to our desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $10,000. The product still holds significant value for me, and I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10500. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to what John would pay. It's a good compromise, and accepting it guarantees a sale."
