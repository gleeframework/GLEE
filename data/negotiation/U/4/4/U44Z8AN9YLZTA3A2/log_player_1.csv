Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone, emphasizing fairness and value for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $980,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your final offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Given the value of the product and our previous discussions, I believe $1,020,000 is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not comfortable going below my threshold. There's a chance that I could continue to negotiate, but the risk of reaching an impasse or wasting more time is too high.  Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'll sell to him and secure the best possible outcome."
