Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $800,000 as my safety net."
