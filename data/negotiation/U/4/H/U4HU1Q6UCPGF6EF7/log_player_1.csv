Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's valuation increases the chance of a quick sale at a high profit margin. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives you leverage to aim high with Bob. 

By offering the product at $1,200,000, you're:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While a high price, it allows for Bob to counter-offer and still land within a range profitable for you.
* **Creating a sense of value:** A high price often reinforces the perception of high value.
* **Securing a substantial profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your $800,000 minimum."
