"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its worth to you is $100, I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us. However, to ensure we're on the same page, I'll make it even more appealing - how about I offer you the chance to purchase it for $120? This way, you save some money and still get access to something valued at $150, while I get a fair return for my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
