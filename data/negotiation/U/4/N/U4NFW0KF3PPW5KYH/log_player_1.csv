**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, the gap between his offers and your minimum price ($1,200,000) is still significant. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable to you within the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price, so it's in your best interest to take the sure thing and maximize your profit."
