Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for potential compromise. It also signals to Bob that I'm confident in the value of my product. 

By offering $1,700,000, I'm giving Bob some space to counteroffer while still leaving a profit margin for myself. I am also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with a counteroffer.  

I am not willing to sell to John for $1,500,000 at this point because there's still a possibility of getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000.  This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while also keeping my minimum profit in mind. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is getting close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  I've already made a counteroffer, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge further. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. It's the most secure and profitable option at this point."
