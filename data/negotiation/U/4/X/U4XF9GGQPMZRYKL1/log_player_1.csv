{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 just isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $140.  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 140}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting my minimum price is too high.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee my minimum profit."
