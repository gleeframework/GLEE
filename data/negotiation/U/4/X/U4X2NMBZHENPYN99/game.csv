"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was too low. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is closer to my desired price and still a good deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Would you be willing to settle at $13,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,750 is still a bit too low. Let's try $14,000. I think that's a fair compromise that allows us both to be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
