"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but one that's not completely unreasonable. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. It's also important to be friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am looking for a lower price. Would you consider selling the product for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price. I've already set a precedent of a higher price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway for now.  How about $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
