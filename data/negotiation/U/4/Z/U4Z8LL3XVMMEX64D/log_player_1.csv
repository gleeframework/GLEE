"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with significant potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and potential to pique Bob's curiosity. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, allowing for a back-and-forth exchange. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product. However, I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Rounds:**  While $850,000 is a good price, I have 8 rounds remaining. There's potential to get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate.  This strengthens my position.
* **Counter-Offer Prep:** By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer and see if Bob's offer is truly his limit.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, potentially at a price between Bob's offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message invites Bob to continue the negotiation, signaling that I'm open to further compromise if necessary.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's attractive to both parties. If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll continue adjusting my offers based on his responses."
