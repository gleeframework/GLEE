{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $107 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counteroffer at $108. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. $108 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $120 and going through the hassle of potentially dealing with a new buyer."
