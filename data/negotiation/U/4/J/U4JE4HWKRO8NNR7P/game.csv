"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to sell to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you think $95 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, which is still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",102.5,Alice,5,
