"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Considering that, I'm willing to make you an offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you, and I believe you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than your maximum price of $1,000,000 and still allows you to save $100,000 compared to buying from John. Therefore, it is the most beneficial option."
