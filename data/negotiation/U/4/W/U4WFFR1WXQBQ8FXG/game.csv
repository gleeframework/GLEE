"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $8,750? I think that's a fair price for the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it.",8800.0,Bob,6,
