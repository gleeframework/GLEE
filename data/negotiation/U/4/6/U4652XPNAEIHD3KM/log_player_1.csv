Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair, emphasizing that it benefits both of us. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm not going too low, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even lower than my starting offer of $950,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. This means there's room for a counteroffer.
* **Sell to John as a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I know I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $850,000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering a price that's halfway between our previous offers is a common negotiation tactic that can appear fair.
* **Emphasize benefit:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is still beneficial for him, as it's significantly less than what he values the product at.
* **Maintain a safety net:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my goal, with the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000.  Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired $1,000,000 and far from my initial goal. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob's offer indicates he is still willing to negotiate. This gives me a chance to try for a higher price.
* **Sell to John is a strong option:**  While I am willing to negotiate, selling to John for $1,000,000 remains a safe and attractive option.
* **Counteroffer to come:**  I will make another counteroffer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me."
