"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $850,000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000.  Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair offer considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price below $800,000.  While $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $825,000 for the product. This is a very competitive price considering the value you place on it. It's also a significant reduction from my previous offers. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
