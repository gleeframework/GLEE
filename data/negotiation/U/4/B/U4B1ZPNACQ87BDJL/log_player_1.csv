{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum value, but also acknowledging that Bob's value is lower. This should encourage him to negotiate, but hopefully not walk away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I want to see if I can push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm really close to walking away and buying from John for $80. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's my final offer. Can you accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is close to my minimum value, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and he's threatening to walk away. It's better to sell to John for $150 and avoid the risk of getting less."
