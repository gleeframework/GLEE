"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, which I understand is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its market value and my own valuation.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm still confident you'll find it a great investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the market value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",13500.0,Alice,5,
