Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm still confident you'll find it a great investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the market value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $13,500 and is holding firm to that price. Taking a sure thing at $12,000 makes more sense than potentially overpaying if negotiations drag on or fail."
