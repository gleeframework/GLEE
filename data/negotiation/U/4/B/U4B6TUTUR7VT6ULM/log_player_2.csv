# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.

I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  This product has the potential to generate far more in returns.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer reflects its worth while still recognizing your interest.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I need to be able to buy the product for less than $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $900,000.

I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, considering the potential returns you'll gain from this unique product.
