Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, given its potential and the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal within this range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product while ensuring we both benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable solution.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at this pace, it is unlikely he will reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer of $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
