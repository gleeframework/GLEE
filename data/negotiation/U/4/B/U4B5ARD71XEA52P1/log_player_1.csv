"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only go up to $8,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $8,000 is significantly below its value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly above $10,000. I can come down to $14,000, that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $12,000.  While we could counteroffer, it's risky. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a significant profit and avoids further negotiation.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
