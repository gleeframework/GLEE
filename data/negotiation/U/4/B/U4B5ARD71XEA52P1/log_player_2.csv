# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* It's definitely worth negotiating further.
