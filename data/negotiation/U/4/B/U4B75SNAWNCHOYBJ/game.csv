"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $700,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging my financial limitations.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway.
