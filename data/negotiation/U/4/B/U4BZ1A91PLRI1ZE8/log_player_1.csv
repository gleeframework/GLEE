Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement without losing out on too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and push for a higher price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or, if necessary, selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

This counteroffer shows I am willing to negotiate and compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value. The offer is a reasonable middle ground, and it increases the pressure on Bob to accept the deal.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer, while slightly higher than his initial proposal, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
