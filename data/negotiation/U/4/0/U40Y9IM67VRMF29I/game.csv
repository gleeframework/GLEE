"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a good deal for you, allowing you to profit from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.
