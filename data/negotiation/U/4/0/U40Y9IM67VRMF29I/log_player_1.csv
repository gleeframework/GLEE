{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a significant profit.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  The message highlights the potential profit Bob can make, making the offer more appealing.
* **Keeping options open:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while leaving the door open to counteroffers and ultimately selling to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're placing on the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and can make a counteroffer that hopefully brings us closer to a desirable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a good deal for you, allowing you to profit from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by dropping my price to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he can make, emphasizing the value he will receive at this price.
* **Collaborative approach:**  The message uses ""work together"" to encourage Bob to continue negotiating and find a solution that's agreeable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price point.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further price reductions, potentially pushing me below my acceptable threshold.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than what I can reasonably expect from Bob at this point. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed high profit, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential price concessions."
