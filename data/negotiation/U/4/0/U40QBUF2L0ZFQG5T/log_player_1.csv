"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,200,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it a potentially attractive offer.

This first round allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay.  I'm prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers, but I won't accept anything below my minimum, and I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's still not as close to my ideal price as I'd like. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and I have John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his first counteroffer. 

This offer is still below Bob's perceived value, and it's closer to my ideal price, which will hopefully lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still far from my ideal price, and I have the luxury of time. I'm not going to settle for a quick deal if I can get closer to my target value.  The negotiation is still young, and I believe there's more room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but it still keeps the value higher than John's offer, giving me a safety net if this negotiation fails. 

This offer represents a significant move towards Bob's last offer, but it's still within a range I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to come up a bit, leading us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is tempting, especially with a few rounds left, it's still a significant distance from my desired price.  There's a chance that Bob will increase his offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better price.  I'm also not in a rush, and I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm making a final push towards a compromise. This offer is only $75,000 away from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still stays above the $950,000 mark I rejected earlier, showing that I'm not desperate and am prepared to walk away if necessary. 

This offer represents a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a good opportunity to close the deal with a price that is close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, and I'm confident I can get a bit closer to my target with just two rounds left.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm ready to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $900,000. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's resistance to go higher while still allowing me to achieve a decent profit. This is likely my final offer, as I'm nearing the end of our allotted rounds. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000.  This offer is a calculated risk, but with only one round left, it's the best way to try to secure a good price while still having a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, as $825,000 is a decent price, but ultimately, I'm going to choose to sell to John for $800,000. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  This is the final round.  There's no time to negotiate further with Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I've set a minimum price of $800,000 for myself, and John's offer guarantees that.  I'm not willing to go lower than that.
* **No guarantee of agreement:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a better counteroffer in the limited time we have left.

While it's not the ideal price,  it's better than risking ending the negotiation with no deal at all.  I'll take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
