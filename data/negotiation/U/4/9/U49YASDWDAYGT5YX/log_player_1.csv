"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price above my minimum, but also leaving some room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not giving away the farm.  It's a high enough price that it might make him consider John's offer, but hopefully low enough that he'll counter.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try and squeeze a little more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  This would allow me to meet my financial goals for this sale. I'm confident that this price remains fair and competitive, given the product's value. Would you be willing to reconsider at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm taking a more aggressive approach here, sticking with a price that's above Bob's offer but still leaving room for some negotiation. I'm highlighting the value of the product again to remind him of its worth.  Hopefully, this will push him closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot meet the $1,100,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,050,000 which is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's a good deal and it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm going to accept this offer to secure the sale."
