"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers.  While I understand your budgetary considerations, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about we consider $1,600,000? I believe this reflects the product's unique capabilities while still offering you a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a price point that works for me. To be honest, $1,600,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer to a deal. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,450,000. This product offers substantial value, and I believe this price is a fair reflection of its potential.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell we're both motivated to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
