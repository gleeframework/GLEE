Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me there.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $850,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
