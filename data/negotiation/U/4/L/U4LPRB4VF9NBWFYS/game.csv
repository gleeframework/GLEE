"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. This would be a reasonable price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me there.",850000.0,Alice,5,
