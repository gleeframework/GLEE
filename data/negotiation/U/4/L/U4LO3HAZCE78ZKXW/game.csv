"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer you the product for $11000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a few concessions already, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $10900, but I'm not going to go any lower. If you're serious about buying the product, this is your last chance to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10900.0,Alice,9,
