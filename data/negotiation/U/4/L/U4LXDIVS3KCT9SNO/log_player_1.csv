Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I know you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below her minimum acceptable price might entice Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, with Alice still ending up above her $12,000 minimum.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might feel he needs to act quickly before the opportunity is gone.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate further down, or he might reject it outright. Alice needs to be prepared for either outcome."
