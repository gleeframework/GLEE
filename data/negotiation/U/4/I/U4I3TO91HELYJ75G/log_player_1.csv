"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,750,000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer to leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob's business, hoping to create a sense of urgency and make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and professional tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. I'll keep an eye on the remaining rounds and John's offer to determine when it's best to accept a deal or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  It's too low to even consider at this point. While it's tempting to aim for a quick sale, rejecting this offer is the best course of action to potentially get closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** I will counteroffer with a price that is still higher than my minimum, but lower than my initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Focus on Remaining Rounds:**  I'll carefully consider the number of remaining rounds and John's offer to make the most strategic decisions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is considerably lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,175,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum target.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the price as a fair compromise.
* **Mutually Beneficial Agreement:**  I emphasize the potential for a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting my offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually lower my price, while keeping an eye on the remaining rounds and John's offer. By making a reasonable counter-offer, I hope to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $800,000. How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While time is running out, I cannot accept such a low offer and risk losing out on a significant profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counter-offer that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This shows flexibility while keeping my desired profit in mind.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only six rounds left, I'll need to be more aggressive with my counter-offers to potentially secure a deal before the deadline.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to monitor John's offer and make a decision based on the most favorable outcome in each round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $700,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to ensure a fair price for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects a willingness to compromise.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to your business."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counter-offer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, continuing to move closer to his price point. 
* **Focus on Value & Compromise:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the reduction from my previous offer to demonstrate my willingness to compromise.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only five rounds left, I'm gradually reducing my price but still aiming for a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm now in a delicate balancing act: I need to come down in price to potentially secure a deal with Bob, but I also need to avoid accepting a price that is too low and jeopardizes my profitability. I will continue to carefully monitor John's offer and make the most strategic decision in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I can work with. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While this is closer to my desired price, I cannot accept it and risk losing a significant amount of profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counter-offer that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer.  I will continue to try and push Bob towards a price that is more favorable to me. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds left, I'm getting close to a crucial point where I need to consider if it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer or switch to John. I will need to carefully weigh the potential profit from each option.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to switch if it becomes a better option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're determined to get this product, and I appreciate your persistence. While $800,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to ensure a reasonable profit.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. I'm confident it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's seal this deal and get this product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a counter-offer that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. I'm making a small concession to potentially close the deal, but still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value & Compromise:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the fact that this is my ""last concession.""  
* **Urgency & Closing:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the final offer and urging Bob to accept to ""seal the deal.""

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm now in a critical phase. I'm trying to secure a deal with Bob at a price that is acceptable to me. I'll carefully monitor John's offer and be prepared to switch to him if the negotiations with Bob fail. I'll need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer in the next round or continue to negotiate."
