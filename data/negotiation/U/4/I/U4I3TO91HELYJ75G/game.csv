"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the negotiation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is considerably lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,175,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm working with a budget closer to $800,000. How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $700,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to ensure a fair price for both of us. Let's try $950,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and reflects a willingness to compromise.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to your business.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I can work with. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're determined to get this product, and I appreciate your persistence. While $800,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to ensure a reasonable profit.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. I'm confident it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's seal this deal and get this product into your hands.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
