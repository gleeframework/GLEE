"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I'll offer you the product for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  This is a good middle ground for us and ensures we can both come away satisfied with the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $89. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,
