"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500 for this product. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $12,500.  Would you consider $13,500? It's a compromise that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a lower price than John's, Bob can likely still negotiate a better deal with Alice. A counteroffer is worth trying to see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
