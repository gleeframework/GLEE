"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations, I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
