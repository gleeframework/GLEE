"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $10000.  It's a one-time opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $10,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer.
