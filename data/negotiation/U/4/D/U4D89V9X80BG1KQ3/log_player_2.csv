"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a bit high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counter-offer slightly above Alice's value ($100). This gives us some bargaining room while still aiming for a price well below our maximum budget. By being polite and expressing continued interest, we keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $118? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but $118 is still a bit high. We can try to negotiate further and see if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nudging the price down towards a more agreeable figure.  By now, Alice likely understands we're serious about buying but want a fair deal. This offer represents a good balance between potential savings and the risk of Alice walking away."
