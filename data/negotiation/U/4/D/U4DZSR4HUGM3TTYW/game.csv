"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $8,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer on price. However, $7,750 is still below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
