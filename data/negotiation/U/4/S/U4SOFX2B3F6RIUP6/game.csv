,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? That's the best I can do for now.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close but $8,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and do $9,400. This would be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",9400.0,Alice,5,
