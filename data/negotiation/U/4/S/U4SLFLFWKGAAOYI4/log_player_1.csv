Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth a lot to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away. It also leaves room for negotiation, which is key in this scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $150 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's better to accept Bob's offer.  While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a good chance Bob will reject any counteroffer. You'd then be left with only John, who is willing to pay the same as Bob. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees you the sale and avoids risking a stalemate."
