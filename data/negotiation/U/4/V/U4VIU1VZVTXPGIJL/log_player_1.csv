{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident you'd leverage it effectively.  While my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels right for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down slightly while still exceeding John's offer.
* **Appeal to Bob's Value Perception:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically can justify the price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  Showing flexibility might encourage Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy balances getting the best deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
