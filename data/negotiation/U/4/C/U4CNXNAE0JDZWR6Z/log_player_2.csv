"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm thinking of starting with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if you'd like. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and I'm running the risk of wasting time. It's more efficient to buy the product from John at $1,000,000 and save myself the potential headache of further negotiations."
