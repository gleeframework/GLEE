"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be highly valuable to your operations. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Consider this your chance to get a significant advantage. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
