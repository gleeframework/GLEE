"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,250. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  It's a good deal for both of us and lets us come to an agreement. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a free consultation to make it an even better value for you. But I still need to make a profit, so I'm sticking with $10,750.",10750.0,Alice,5,
