Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,250. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.

Bob should reject the offer. He can still potentially get a better price. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's counteroffer is still above his desired price. There's room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a free consultation to make it an even better value for you. But I still need to make a profit, so I'm sticking with $10,750.

Bob should accept the offer. He's able to get the product for $10,750, which is within his budget and a good deal considering the added value of the warranty and consultation. While he could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go lower, and he risks losing out on the deal."
