"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $12,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $12,000? This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
