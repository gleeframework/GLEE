"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,050,000 right now.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,225,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,175,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to work within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
