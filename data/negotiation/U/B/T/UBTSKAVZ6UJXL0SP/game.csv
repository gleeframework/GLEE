"While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a price a little lower. How about we settle at $1,070,000? This would be a great compromise for both of us. I'm confident that this product is worth it to you at this price, and it's well within my budget.",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
