Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also maximizes my potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still reflecting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a more agreeable price."

I'm offering a compromise price. This shows Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway, but it's still a respectable profit for me.  If he accepts, great. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 and be done with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  Rather than continue this back-and-forth, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. It's guaranteed profit, and while it's not my ideal outcome, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a worse offer."
