"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's currently priced at $1,700,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value.  I understand this is a big decision, but I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
