{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than your minimum value ($12,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good initial price:**  The initial offer is ambitious, setting a higher starting point for potential negotiation. 
* **Show confidence:**  A confident starting price shows that you value your product and are willing to negotiate from a strong position.
* **Encourage a response:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, you can:

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully sold the product!
* **If Bob rejects:** You'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of your own. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  You can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 to ensure you make at least your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $13000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000,  I'm going to **reject** it and try to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for a compromise between $13,000 and my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would be a guaranteed $12,000, there's a chance I could get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $14,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $14,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the price for both parties. I'm also reiterating that I appreciate Bob's offer and am willing to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $14,000 is still closer to my desired price, and I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and potentially move closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide my next move based on his reaction. I'm prepared to either accept his offer if he counters with $14,000 or make another counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your original price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my desired price and a significant improvement over John's offer of $12,000. I'm going to **accept** Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:**  $13,500 is only $500 less than my original asking price of $14,000.
* **Significant gain over John:** Accepting Bob's offer means earning $1,500 more than I would by selling to John.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. I've successfully negotiated a good price for the product and maximized my earnings!"
