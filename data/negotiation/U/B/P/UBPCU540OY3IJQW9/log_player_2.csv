"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While it looks promising, $180 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer than our actual budget ($120). This gives us room to negotiate upwards and hopefully secure a price closer to $100.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is respectful of Alice's time but clearly states our position and desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still more than we're willing to spend. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's space to negotiate between $140 and our maximum of $120.  

Let's see if we can get Alice to move closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the effort. To be honest, $120 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** We're being transparent with Alice about our budget limit. This shows her we're serious and not playing games.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning we're ""ready to close the deal right now,"" we add a touch of pressure and incentivize a quick agreement.
* **Walk-Away Point:**  We're at our maximum price. If Alice rejects this, we'll buy from John for $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is your limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll give you a deal for $130. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is firm at $130, which is above our strict $120 budget.
* **John is Available:**  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at our desired price. 

There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice when we can get the product for our target price elsewhere."
