"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to you, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $110. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than the original price, aiming to reach a fair compromise. I look forward to your consideration.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a fair middle ground between our previous offers.  Let's try to get this deal done.",105.0,Bob,4,
