"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair price that still gives you a decent profit.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
