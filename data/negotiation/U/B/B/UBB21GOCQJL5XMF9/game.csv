"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to both benefit from the transaction.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $13,000? This is a fair price that considers your needs and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable ask.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I understand you need to get a good price for the product, and I'm eager to make this deal work. I'm going to stick with my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price that considers your needs and my budget.  Let's close this deal and move on.",13000.0,Bob,6,
