"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12800 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15000, and it's closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think!",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer! I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15000, and it's only a slight increase from your last offer.
