"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is the highest I can go. I'd love to hear if you're willing to accept this price.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $12500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'd love to hear if you're willing to accept this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
