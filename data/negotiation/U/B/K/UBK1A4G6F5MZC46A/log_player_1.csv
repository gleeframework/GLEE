``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, which might make him more likely to negotiate. It also leaves room for me to lower the price if needed, but it's still a good price for me, as it's significantly higher than my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my original offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can push for a bit more.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,875?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 one more time, but that's as high as I can go. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is dragging on. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I get the minimum value I require."
