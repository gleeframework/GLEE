"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product at a fair price, while I still receive a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a compromise considering our previous discussions.  This offer is my final one. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll move on to another buyer. What's your final decision?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $940,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate. Can you consider $920,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,6,
