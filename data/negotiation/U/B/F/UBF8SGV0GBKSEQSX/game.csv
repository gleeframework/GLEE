,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still leaves me with a smaller profit than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,6,
