Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob only values the product at $80, I have a guaranteed buyer at $150. It makes sense to start negotiations higher. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $120 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for me.
* **Not being unreasonable:**  A price of $120 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but not outrageously high. There's a chance he might see it as a fair deal.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll know to accept John's offer of $150. There's no point in going lower than my guaranteed sale price."
