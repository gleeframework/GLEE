Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $150,000 if Bob accepts my offer.
* **Finding a Balance:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is significantly more appealing to Bob than his perceived value of $1,000,000, while still allowing me to make a substantial profit.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" it might make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and encourage him to act quickly."
