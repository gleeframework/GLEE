"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $75 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would still give you a good deal on the product, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
