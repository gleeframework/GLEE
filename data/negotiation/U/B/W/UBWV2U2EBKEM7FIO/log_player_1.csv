Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I'd like to propose $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to the initial offer and while haggling for more is tempting, accepting $100 is a good deal and ensures you maximize profit in a timely manner.  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and waiting too long risks him walking away."
