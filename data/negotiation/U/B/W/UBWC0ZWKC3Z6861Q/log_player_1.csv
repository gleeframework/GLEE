Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product for sale that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $2,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This is a starting point for the negotiation. Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Ambition:** I'm aiming for a significant profit margin, hoping to get more than the minimum $1,500,000.
* **Flexibility:** $2,000,000 leaves room to negotiate down if needed, without sacrificing too much profit. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Potential Value:** I have no information about Bob's resources or how much he might value the product. This makes the negotiation risky, as he could easily reject my offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will pay $1,500,000 provides a safety net. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob, knowing I have a backup. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $500,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  I understand budget constraints, but this product has real potential.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,250,000?  This would still give you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Here's my reasoning for this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my initial price by 37.5%. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a respectable profit. 
* **Fairness:** $1,250,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but more in line with the potential value of the product, as I see it. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1250000 is still too high for me. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only comfortable going up to $700000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to reach an agreement with Bob, his final offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It seems unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer of $1,500,000 and sell the product to him."
