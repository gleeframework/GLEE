"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,200,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I hope this might open up a path to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work. I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us, so I'm willing to offer one final compromise.  If you can meet me at $1,175,000, I'm ready to finalize the sale.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
