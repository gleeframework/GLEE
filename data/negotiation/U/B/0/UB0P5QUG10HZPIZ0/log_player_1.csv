Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Justification:** By stating you believe it will be valuable to Bob, you're framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Alternative Implied:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly (without stating John's offer) subtly implies there are other interested parties.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the offer is high, it leaves a significant profit margin if Bob rejects it and you sell to John."
