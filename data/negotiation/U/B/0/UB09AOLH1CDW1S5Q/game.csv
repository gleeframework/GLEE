"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for return.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe this product has the potential to yield even greater returns. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the full $1,350,000. Considering the value you placed on it initially, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges the potential risks and uncertainties.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
