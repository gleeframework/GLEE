"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high.  While it's a discount from your maximum, you can likely negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This reflects the value it holds for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above what the product is worth to her ($800,000), indicating there's still room for negotiation.
* However, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $1,500,000, and it's a good deal considering you can still make a profit.
* While you could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, balancing potential further savings with the risk of a worse outcome."
