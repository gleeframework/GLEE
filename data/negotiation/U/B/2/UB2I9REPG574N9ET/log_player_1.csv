Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that to test his willingness to negotiate. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,500}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. I'll consider my options carefully.

Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I'm not thrilled about selling it to him for $11,000. However, I don't want to lose the deal entirely, so I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's original offer, but it's closer to what I was initially looking for. Let's see how Bob responds!"
