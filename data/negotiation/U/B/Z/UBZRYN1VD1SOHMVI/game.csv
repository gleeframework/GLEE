"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I believe it's worth at least $12000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it gives you a chance to own it before someone else does. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,
