"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm still only comfortable paying $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  I hope you'll reconsider my offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $975,000 is a good price for Bob.  It's slightly above his ideal price but still a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's worth closing the deal with Alice at this point rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
