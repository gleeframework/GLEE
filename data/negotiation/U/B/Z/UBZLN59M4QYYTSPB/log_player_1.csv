Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired $9,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly unwilling to come up in price. I've already rejected a lower offer from him, and I don't see him getting closer to my desired price.  I'm better off selling to John for $8,000."
