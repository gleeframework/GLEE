Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close, but I'm not quite ready to give up on a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This price is very close to Alice's value, and with fewer rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can get it much lower. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or me having to settle for John's higher offer."
