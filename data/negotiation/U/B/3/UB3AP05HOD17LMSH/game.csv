"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a better deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this a win-win situation, I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000.  This price is closer to what I need and still offers you a great deal. Let's find a resolution in this round.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to feel comfortable with the price. I'm offering $980,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
