"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to get closer to the product's value to Bob. This way, I can gauge his interest and potentially secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, aiming to secure a deal closer to Bob's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob. This counteroffer gives him an opportunity to come closer to my asking price without losing too much on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, it's close enough.  I don't want to risk losing him entirely by continuing to haggle.  I'll accept his offer, as it's the best I'm likely to get and it's above my minimum."
