"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least close to my asking price.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $12,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
