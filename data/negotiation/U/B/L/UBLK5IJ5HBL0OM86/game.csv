"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $900000?  This would be a significant discount from my initial offer and a good value for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to get a good deal, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  Let's try $875000. This would be a good middle ground, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",860000.0,Bob,6,
