"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. To start, let me propose a price of $14000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his desire to save money.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $12,500 is still a profitable price for Alice, considering her valuation of $12,000.  It leaves room for further negotiation but shows Bob is serious about buying the product.
* **Openness:** The message conveys Bob's willingness to work towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. I am willing to consider $13000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for improvement.
* **Seeking Lower Price:** Bob wants to pay as little as possible and can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **No Immediate Pressure:** There's no reason to accept yet, as Bob has time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land a little lower.  I'd like to offer $12,800 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering our respective valuations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, demonstrating his seriousness while keeping pressure on Alice. 
* **Fairness:** He frames his counteroffer as being fair to both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $12,800 is only $200 away from Alice's valuation, increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm pleased to propose $13200 for the product. I hope this figure aligns more closely with what you're looking for while still reflecting its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but there's still a $400 gap.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and likely can secure a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **No Urgency:**  There's no immediate need to accept. Bob can continue to negotiate, aiming for the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This seems like a reasonable price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal today. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob is proposing a price exactly in the middle of Alice's last offer and his previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the deal seem like a logical next step.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly introduces a sense of urgency by mentioning closing the deal ""today"". This could encourage Alice to accept, as it implies that waiting might mean losing the deal.
* **Finality:**  While Bob is open to negotiation, this counteroffer is meant to be a strong closing point, showing Alice that he's committed to this price."
