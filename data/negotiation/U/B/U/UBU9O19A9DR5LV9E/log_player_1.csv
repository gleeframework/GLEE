Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $20,000. It's a real steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $17,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair deal and we're getting closer to a resolution.  I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely, especially as we're getting near the middle ground."
