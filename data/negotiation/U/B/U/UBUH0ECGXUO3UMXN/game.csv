"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to make sure I can stay within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,750. This way, we both can be happy with the deal.  What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent. How about we try $9,500 again? I'm willing to hold firm on this price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,6,
