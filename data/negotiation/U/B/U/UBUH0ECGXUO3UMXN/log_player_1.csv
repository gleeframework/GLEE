Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,750. This way, we both can be happy with the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent. How about we try $9,500 again? I'm willing to hold firm on this price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price,  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go any higher.  $9,500 is a good price and will allow me to make a profit.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
