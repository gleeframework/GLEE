"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value for you at $1,500,000. I am offering you the chance to own this masterpiece at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This exclusive offer is tailored to recognize your discerning taste and commitment to excellence. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum valuation.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and her offer of $1,350,000 is less, but you can likely do better.
* **John's offer serves as a leverage point.** You know John will sell the product for $1,500,000.  This gives you a strong position to negotiate with Alice.

**By rejecting Alice's first offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further, getting you closer to your target.**"
