Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $14,250. I'd like to offer $13,750 for the product. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $13,750 is a significant profit margin over your minimum ($12,000).
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better offer from Bob, and it delays getting the money.
* **Risk:**  There's always a chance Bob walks away if negotiations drag on.

Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potential downsides."
