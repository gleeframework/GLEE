"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $11,000? I believe that's a fair price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $13,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll offer you a new price of $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my budget limit. How about we make this our final offer - $12,000.  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,6,
