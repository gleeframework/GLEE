"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get in on the ground floor. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product is valuable, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. It's a fair middle ground, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm ready to close this deal but I need you to meet me a bit closer to my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
