"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might come back with a better offer to avoid losing the sale."
