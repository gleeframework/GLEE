"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my final offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $800,000 is still too low. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000. If we can't agree on this price, I might have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
