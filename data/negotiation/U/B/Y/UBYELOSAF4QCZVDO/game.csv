,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
