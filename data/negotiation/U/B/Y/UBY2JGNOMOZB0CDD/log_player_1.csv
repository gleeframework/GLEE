Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 profit margin for him.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, and you don't know how high Bob is actually willing to go.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  The ideal price leaves Bob feeling like he got a good deal while still netting you significantly more than your backup offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,350,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is your ideal price, the offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more in control of the process.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair reflection of its worth and potential benefits,"" you subtly imply the price is tied to objective value, not just your desire to sell.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter, and you'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go before accepting John's offer becomes the better option."
