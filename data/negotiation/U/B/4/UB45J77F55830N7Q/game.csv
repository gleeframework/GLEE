"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant way off from what I consider fair value.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
