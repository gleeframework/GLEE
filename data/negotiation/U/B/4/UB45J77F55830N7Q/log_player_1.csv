Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant way off from what I consider fair value.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $900,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
