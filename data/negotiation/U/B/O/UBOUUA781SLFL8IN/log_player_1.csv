Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $9,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount while still netting you a significant profit.
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  Offering it to Bob first at this attractive price might encourage a quick sale before he considers other options. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
