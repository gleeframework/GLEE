Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're guaranteed at least $1,200,000 from John, so you want to aim higher.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,400,000 is a good distance from Bob's maximum of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair price:**  While Bob gets a better deal than John, you still make a significant profit. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
