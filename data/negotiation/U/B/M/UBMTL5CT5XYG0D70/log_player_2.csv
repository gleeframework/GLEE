"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be a valuable addition to your business. We are offering the product for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's first offer is too high. We have room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for presenting the product. I see its value, but that price point is a bit too high for me. Could we work something closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

We're starting with a strong counter-offer that leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $800,000 walk-away point. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your offer, we believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Our counteroffer is $825,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our budget with John. Let's keep negotiating and see if we can push her a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a deal. This counteroffer shows Alice we're serious while still leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. Our counteroffer is $775,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is getting tight! Alice is definitely willing to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too close to our fallback option.  We'll push a little further, but we need to be prepared to either accept her next offer or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can offer $760,000, but that's really the best I can manage."",
""product_price"": 760000
}
``` 

We're drawing a line in the sand here. This offer represents a strong commitment on our part, and it's getting very close to Alice's likely lower bound. Let's see if she takes the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Our counteroffer is $770,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While we could try to push for a few thousand more in savings, it's getting risky. Accepting this offer gets us the product for a good price – a $30,000 savings compared to John – and avoids the potential of the negotiation falling apart."
