"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this product for a price that's significantly less than its value to you.  It's a unique opportunity for you to gain a substantial competitive edge.  My price is $1,200,000, which represents a fair deal for both of us.  Consider the potential return on investment this product will provide, and let me know your decision.  If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The product is worth more to you than it is to Alice.**  This means you are still getting a good deal, even at $1,200,000."
