"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. It's a good starting point as it's a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to drop my counteroffer to $10,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a reasonable price that still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I've only got a few rounds left, and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  John offers a guaranteed profit that's significantly higher than what Bob is offering. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal."
