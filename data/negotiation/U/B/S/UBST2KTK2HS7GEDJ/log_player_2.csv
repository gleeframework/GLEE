"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is still a bit high. There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting and seeing if she'll come down. If not, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
