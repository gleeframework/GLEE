"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000 again? I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I think $1,220,000 is the highest I can go.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
