"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it will be a great asset to your business.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. While $1,650,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a lower price, and the risk of going over budget is too high.  John is the safer choice."
