"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,600,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. Let's split the difference and aim for $1,400,000.  This would give us both a good deal, and I believe we can still make this transaction work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I need to think about the profit I'll make on this deal. Let me see... I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $1,550,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
