"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll gauge his reaction to this initial high offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'll use this opportunity to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $900,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $650,000, I'm holding out for more. I'm not sure how much Bob is willing to pay, but I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  Plus, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is a compromise that's still profitable for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, it seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher than $750,000, and I'm not willing to accept that.  John's offer guarantees me a safe and profitable deal. It's time to move on and secure the sale."
