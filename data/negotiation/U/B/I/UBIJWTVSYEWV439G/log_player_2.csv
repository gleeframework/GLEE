Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10000 to you, I propose we start our negotiation at $11000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.

```"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10800. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,800.  This is a good price for Bob, considering his goal of saving as much money as possible.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice could reject his next offer and the deal might fall through.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is a sensible choice."
