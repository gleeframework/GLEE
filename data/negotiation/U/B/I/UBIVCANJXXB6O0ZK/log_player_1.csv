Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000).** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer, as he still gets a good deal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profits and ensuring a smooth negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my ideal price. I want to maximize my profit, and I believe I can achieve a higher price.  

Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,150,000. This strategy allows me to maintain a strong negotiation stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,125,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **It's a more favorable price than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not giving in entirely. 
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** He still gets the product for less than its value to him ($1,200,000).
* **It keeps the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to accept a deal, but it's not so high that he'll likely walk away. 

This strategy aims to maintain a strong negotiating position while also showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is exactly what I initially proposed, and it's a good deal for me.  

* **It meets my desired price:** This ensures I'm getting the maximum profit possible from this sale.
* **It's a win-win:**  Bob gets the product for less than its value to him, and I get the price I'm aiming for.

There's no reason to continue negotiating when we've reached an agreement that benefits both parties."
