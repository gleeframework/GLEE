Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$145 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above Bob's valuation, giving me a chance to make a profit, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It acknowledges Bob's potential interest while highlighting the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good deal!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer based on his proposed price and how confident I feel about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer isn't profitable enough for me.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first.** 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $145."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet.  How about $140? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my initial offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"":** I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focus on a positive outcome for both sides:**  The message highlights that both parties can benefit from a deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John based on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is close to my minimum acceptable price:** While it's not ideal, it's within a range that allows me to make a profit.
* **Bob's message suggests he's unlikely to budge further:** His statement ""That's the lowest I can go"" indicates he's reached his limit.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to Bob altogether, and I don't want to risk selling to John at a lower price than what Bob is offering.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $135."
