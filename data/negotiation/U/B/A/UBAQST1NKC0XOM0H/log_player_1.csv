"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, which is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and friendly:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value proposition:** I'm implying that the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value of $100, hoping to get him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is still interested in the product, so there's room for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, but I want to try and get a better price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This reflects the value of the product and also shows I'm open to working with you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product to encourage Bob to come up a bit more.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to maintain a good relationship for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a safe backup:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation might still be possible:** Although Bob's last offer was lower than my counteroffer, he still seems interested and is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:**  I'm continuing to compromise by lowering my offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Emphasize fair value:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Show willingness to close the deal:** I'm using language like ""Let's see if we can make this happen"" to signal my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $115. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a safe backup:** I can sell to John for $150, which is a guaranteed profit and more than what Bob is currently offering.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has stated his price is the lowest he can go, so there is likely not much more room for him to increase his offer.  It might be best to move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer. This shows a final willingness to compromise, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:**  Using phrases like ""finalize this deal"" adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reiterating that this is a fair price considering the product's value.

**Important Note:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially losing the deal to John is increasing.  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while also hinting at finality to push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'd be willing to meet you at $118. That's the closest I can get to your price without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are down to the final few rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.
* **John is a sure bet:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and is more than what Bob is currently offering.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a high chance that Bob will continue to reject my offers, leading to a failed negotiation.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
