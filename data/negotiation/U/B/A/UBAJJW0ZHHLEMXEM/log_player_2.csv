"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. There's no harm in rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price quickly. This is a bold move, but it signals my seriousness about getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer strategy based on her response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I'm still hopeful to get closer to my target price of $8,500.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $8,800. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm also trying to meet her halfway.  It's a more moderate approach than my previous offer, which could be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a significant price reduction and is only $500 away from my last counteroffer. It's getting close to my desired price, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $10,000 is too high. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
