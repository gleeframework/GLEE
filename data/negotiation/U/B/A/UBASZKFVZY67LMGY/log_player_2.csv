"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than its actual cost of $10,000. Considering its worth to you, let's aim for a fair price. Would you be interested in discussing a price that reflects its true value to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you consider $11,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think."",

``` 

Alice is slowly moving towards my desired price range, but we're still not quite there yet. I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose a slightly lower counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, $12,000 is still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle at $11,750? That feels like a fair deal to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Based on our previous offers, I am willing to sell the product at $11,875. I believe this price respects both the value of the product to you and the overall market conditions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could likely push for a slightly lower price, $11,875 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly less than John's offer and a good deal overall."
