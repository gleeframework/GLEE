{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you, and Alice is asking for double that. It's logical to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $1,750,000 is closer to your limit, it's still above your maximum acceptable price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. It's not clear if she'll continue to lower the price, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a price you're comfortable with. It's time to secure the product at your maximum price from John."
