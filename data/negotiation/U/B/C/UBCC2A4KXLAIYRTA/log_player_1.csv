Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $950,000 leaves space for negotiation while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  The message aims for a collaborative negotiation rather than an adversarial one. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option open to negotiate down or accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth significantly more to him. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a desire to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the significant discount from the initial offer, reminding Bob of the product's value.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The wording aims to find a win-win situation rather than continuing a back-and-forth negotiation that could lead to impasse.

By lowering the price considerably while still staying above my minimum, I hope to incentivize Bob to accept a price that is significantly more beneficial for me than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate. Bob's offer is now close enough to my target that the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the sale. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Holding out for a higher price from Bob could mean missing out on a guaranteed sale to John, especially if Bob's future offers remain below $850,000. 

While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potentially lengthy and fruitless haggling."
