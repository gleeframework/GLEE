Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, which is my initial counteroffer. I'd be happy to discuss further if you're willing to consider this price.

Bob seems firmly rooted at $12,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
