"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $10000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to let it go for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. It's still a good value for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to let it go for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $10,000, and it's closer to Bob's target price of $9,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of paying more."
