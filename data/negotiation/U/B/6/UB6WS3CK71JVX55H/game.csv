"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 is already a very competitive offer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This offer represents a balance between its true worth and a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I've tried to be flexible, but $875,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",887500.0,Alice,5,
