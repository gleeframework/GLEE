"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's priced at $12000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a step closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's better to keep trying to get a better deal rather than accepting a price that's above his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal without either of us feeling like we've made a huge concession."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a huge concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. Bob has already made a counteroffer of $8,750, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option.  If he can't get a better price, he can always switch to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,750. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $8750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $8875.  This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's getting very close, Bob has three rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to see if he can get a better price, especially considering John is offering the product for $8,000. If Bob can't get a better price, he can always switch to John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,875 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8,750. This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
