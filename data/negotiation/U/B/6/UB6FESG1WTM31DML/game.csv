"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's priced at $12000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8750. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal without either of us feeling like we've made a huge concession.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a huge concession.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8750. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it benefits both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $8750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $8875.  This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8875 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8750. This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,8,
