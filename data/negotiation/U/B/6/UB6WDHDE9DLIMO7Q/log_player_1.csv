Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""significant value,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 if Bob refuses. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and non-aggressive approach."
