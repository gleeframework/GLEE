{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,250,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the game:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round. Consider starting with a significant discount to show Alice you're serious about negotiating."

{""product_price"": 1000000}

* **Alice's Minimum:** This offer aligns with Alice's minimum acceptable price, demonstrating that you understand her needs while also maximizing your potential savings.
* **Setting the Stage:** This aggressive offer provides a good starting point for the negotiation. If Alice rejects it, you can increase your offer gradually in subsequent rounds."

* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This offer aims to gauge whether Alice is prepared to move further down in price or if she's set on her current price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Alice accepts this offer, you secure a good price for the product while staying within your budget.

* **Time Pressure:** While time is ticking, it's still worth trying to secure a lower price. It's only Round 7, and you still have a few rounds left to find a better deal.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Buying from John is a guaranteed transaction but at a higher price. There's a chance you can still get a better deal from Alice. 

**Next Steps:**

Make a counteroffer in the next round that is higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's. You are approaching your maximum price limit, so consider a smaller increment."

* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds remaining, this counteroffer aims to test Alice's willingness to compromise while maintaining a realistic chance of reaching a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Alice accepts this offer, you've successfully negotiated a decent price for the product. 
* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  If Alice rejects your offer, you'll need to carefully consider your options. If she makes a counteroffer closer to your desired price, you might accept. Otherwise, you'll need to decide between making another counteroffer or proceeding with the purchase from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and is higher than John's price. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only one round left, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a better price with Alice. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  Buying from John guarantees you'll acquire the product, even though it's slightly more expensive than your desired price. This is a safer option than risking another round of negotiation with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You can proceed to purchase the product from John, as it's the most logical option at this point. You've secured a product within your budget, although not at your ideal price."
