Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at a price slightly lower than Bob's maximum valuation ($120) maximizes your potential profit. By offering it at $110, you leave some room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you had more information, you could potentially push for a higher price.
* It's a balance between greed and ensuring the sale. If you ask for too much, Bob might reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for $80 from John."
