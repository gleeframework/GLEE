"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $9,000. Can we work something out?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I need to be mindful of the product's value.  I could consider coming down slightly to $10,500.  This offer reflects my bottom line.",10500.0,Alice,5,
