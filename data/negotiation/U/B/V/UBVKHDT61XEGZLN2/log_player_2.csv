"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This exceptional item comes with a wealth of features that promise to enhance your daily experience. For this remarkable opportunity, I am proposing a price of $120. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or making a purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is at his maximum price point. 
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price.
* The alternative of buying from John offers no advantage, as it is the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in your product, $120 is my absolute maximum. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial planning. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, and we can proceed with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still within Bob's budget and a better price than buying from John.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his offer again and ultimately he'd have to pay $120 to John. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice, securing the product at a slightly discounted price."
