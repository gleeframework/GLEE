"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
