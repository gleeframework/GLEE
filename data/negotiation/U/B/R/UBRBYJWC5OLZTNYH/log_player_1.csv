"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product and focuses on a positive outcome. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $175 is still less than what I'd sell to John, so I can still make a profit even if Bob negotiates down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation room:** I want to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, which is a better deal than Bob's offer, but I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is simply too low for me. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **High enough for profit:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'll still make a profit.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept my offer. 
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm suggesting a ""meet halfway"" approach to emphasize fairness and potentially increase Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $130. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still below my $150 floor.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I want to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my desired amount.
* **John's offer:**  Although John's offer is the most secure, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if we can close a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that the price is fair.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for reaching an agreement, encouraging Bob to see this as a win-win situation. 
* **Maintaining profit:** $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $130, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the limit:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No further negotiation:**  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum profit requirement. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that ensures I meet my profit goal. 

It's better to sell to John now and avoid the risk of further rounds of negotiation with Bob, which might lead to an even lower price or a failed deal."
