"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and sets the expectation that the product is valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is my ideal price, I'm aware Bob's limit is $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 is a safety net. It allows me to be firm in my negotiations without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's room to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially getting closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000, while still being reasonable given his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Focusing on Finding Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a solution that works for both of us, making it less about ""winning"" and more about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer to $950,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are now in round 4, meaning we have fewer rounds left to reach an agreement. While I don't want to risk selling to John, I also don't want to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, and I believe I can still push for a price closer to my desired amount. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $1,000,000 but slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we both want to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm suggesting a price that is halfway between my last offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. 
* **Above Minimum:**  $1,025,000 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by stating that we both want to reach an agreement and suggesting a finalization of the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  We are in round 6, and Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  While there's still room for negotiation, the remaining rounds are limited, and I'm not confident that I can reach a price that meets my minimum.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum price and ensures a successful deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially not reach a deal at all. Selling to John ensures a safe and guaranteed outcome.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum requirement. Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point."
