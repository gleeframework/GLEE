"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, my maximum price point.  This would still be a substantial gain for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1750000. This allows you to get a good deal, while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
