"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount. $950,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, and Bob is leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds.  This strategy shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and encourages Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive.  Bob can aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 in his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering John's price. This shows Alice that he's willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further. It puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale.  This is a strategic move to see if Alice is more motivated to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  The fact that Alice is willing to move closer to Bob's price suggests she's also interested in reaching an agreement.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small but meaningful counteroffer, showing Alice that he's still trying to get a better price.  By offering $1,010,000, Bob is testing the waters to see if Alice is willing to go down just a little bit more. This could be the last chance to get a better deal before potentially accepting Alice's offer or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and there are only 3 rounds left.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become more firm and refuse to budge further.  Accepting the offer at $1,015,000 saves Bob $15,000 compared to buying from John, and is a reasonable compromise given the limited time remaining."
