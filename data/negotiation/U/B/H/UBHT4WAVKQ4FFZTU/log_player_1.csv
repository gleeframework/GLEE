Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives us leverage to aim higher with Bob."
