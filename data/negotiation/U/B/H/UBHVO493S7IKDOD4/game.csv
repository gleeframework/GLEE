"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to let go of for a great price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $132. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $132 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
