Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is far too low for me, considering my minimum price is $150. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is far below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering you the product for $120. This is a good price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}

I'm still not comfortable selling for $90. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
