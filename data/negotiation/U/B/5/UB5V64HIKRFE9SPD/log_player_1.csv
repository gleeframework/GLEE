{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll make a counteroffer that reflects the product's true value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This gives you a fair price and me a decent return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,000. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal outcome. I'll make one final counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. If Bob still rejects, I'll sell to John and secure my desired profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but $9,500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250, but no more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still too low for me. While I'd prefer to sell to him, my goal is to earn as much as possible. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and secure the better deal."
