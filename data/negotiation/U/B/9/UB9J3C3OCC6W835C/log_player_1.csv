"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he's not, I'll quickly switch to John and secure the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a substantial profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal and am willing to be flexible.  We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, and I want to see if he'll bite."
