Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal with Bob before resorting to John's offer.  It's still early in the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and acknowledges your interest. What do you say?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not quite there at $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Bob is signaling that this is his final offer, and accepting means losing out on potential profit. However, rejecting his offer carries the risk of him walking away entirely.  There's still room to negotiate, so I'll push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your straightforwardness. While $1,225,000 is close, I can't accept it knowing its true value. To avoid wasting either of our time, I'm willing to land at $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,225,000. I'm confident that this is the best I can do, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has firmly reiterated his final offer of $1,225,000. While it's slightly below my desired price, continuing the negotiation poses a significant risk of losing him entirely. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of walking away with nothing."
