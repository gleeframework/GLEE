Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices where a deal is mutually beneficial exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Negotiation Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to:

1. **Start High:** Begin the negotiation closer to your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation but ensures you don't leave money on the table.
2. **Be Confident:**  Convey that you believe in the product's value.
3. **Don't Reveal John:** Never mention your guaranteed sale to John. It weakens your position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a high-quality asset."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving room for negotiation while staying comfortably above your minimum.
* **Value-Based Language:** Phrases like ""exceptional product"", ""unique value"", and ""high-quality asset"" emphasize the worth, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Direct and Confident:**  The tone is professional and assured, indicating you believe in the offer's fairness.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
