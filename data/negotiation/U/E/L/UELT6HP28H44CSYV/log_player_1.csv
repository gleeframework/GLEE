Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. My initial offer is $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand he's trying to negotiate, $90 is too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $105? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $105 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $102.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $102.5 is a good price, and it's close enough to my desired price point. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
