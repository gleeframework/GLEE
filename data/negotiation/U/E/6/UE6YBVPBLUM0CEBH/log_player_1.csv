"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting $9,000 now is a $1,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's strategically better to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
