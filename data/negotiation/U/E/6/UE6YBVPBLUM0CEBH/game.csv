"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
