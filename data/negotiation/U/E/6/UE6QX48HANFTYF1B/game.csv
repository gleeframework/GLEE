"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand that you're trying to get the best possible price, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and allows us to close this transaction. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
