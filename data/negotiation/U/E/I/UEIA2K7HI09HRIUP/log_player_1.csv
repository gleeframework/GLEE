""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's really keen.
* **Above Minimum:** This price ensures a profit above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000), even if Bob negotiates down a bit. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
