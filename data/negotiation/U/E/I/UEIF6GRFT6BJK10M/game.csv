"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and leaves some room for us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I think this price is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can close the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
