Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my $8,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway between $14000 and $11000, which is $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still higher than my desired price of $8,000. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for my budget-friendly price."
