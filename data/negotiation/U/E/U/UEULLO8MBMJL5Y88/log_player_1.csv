{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a reasonable price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum desired value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to take the $9,000, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'm going to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my absolute bottom line. This gives you a good deal, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum desired value. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's taking up time and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get the best possible price."
