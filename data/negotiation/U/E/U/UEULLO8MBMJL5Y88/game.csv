"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my absolute bottom line. This gives you a good deal, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
