"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value and leaves me very little room for profit. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. It's also still higher than my minimum value, giving me some profit.  I hope this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum value of $10,000 and gives me a reasonable profit.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the negotiation process and there's a risk Bob could walk away or I could miss out on the opportunity to sell to John.  It's time to close the deal."
