"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to pay $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $9,500 is a good deal for Bob, significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice is already close to her target price, so further counteroffers may be unlikely to yield much more savings. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's always a chance that Alice will walk away, or Bob might miss out on a better price by waiting.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point ensures he gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
