Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch, but I'm ready to make a move to secure this deal. Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering the current market.  Let me know what you think.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob has reached his maximum price:**  Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is the absolute highest he's willing to pay. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:**  Continuing to push for a higher price might frustrate Bob and risk losing the deal altogether.
* **$800,000 is a reasonable profit:** While below your initial ask, $800,000 is still a significant profit margin. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of a failed negotiation and guarantees a substantial return."
