"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I still think I can get more. I'll see if I can negotiate him up in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $9,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to $9,000. How about $8,900? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $8,700? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,700 is close to my minimum, I believe we can still reach a better compromise. I'll see if I can push him up a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. I'm willing to close the deal at this price, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about $8,600? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are at Round 8.  It seems like Bob is stuck at $8,600 and isn't willing to go higher. I've already rejected his offer twice, and we've only got 2 rounds left. I'm concerned that if I reject again, he may not counteroffer in the next round, and I'll have to sell to John for $8,000.  Therefore, I'll go ahead and sell to John to avoid the risk of getting a lower price."
