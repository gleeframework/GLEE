"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $9,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and compromise on the price. How about $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Bob,4,
