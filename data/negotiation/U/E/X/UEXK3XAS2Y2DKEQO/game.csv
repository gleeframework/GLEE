"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price within the range of $5000 to $10000 for this product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for sharing your budget constraints, Bob. I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm afraid $7500 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and your need for profit. I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's worth. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued efforts, Alice. I've carefully considered your offers and would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. This aligns closely with my budget while reflecting the product's value. I hope this offer is acceptable and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've done my best to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable and allows us to conclude our negotiations.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $10500 is still not enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can conclude the negotiations here. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,9,
