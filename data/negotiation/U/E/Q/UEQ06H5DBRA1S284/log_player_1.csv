"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still leaving some room for negotiation. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for Bob to counter, but also demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm again lowering my price a bit, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This offer is still higher than Bob's last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the remaining rounds."
