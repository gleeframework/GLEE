Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offered price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value to justify the high price, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees a minimum price, aiming higher with Bob increases your potential profit."
