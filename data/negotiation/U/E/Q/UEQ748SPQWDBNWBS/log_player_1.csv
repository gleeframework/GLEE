Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a courtesy. I think it would be very valuable for you.  I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down closer to $12,000 if needed.
* **Polite and Strategic:** The message frames the offer as a courtesy to Bob, potentially making him more receptive. Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically can also make the price seem more reasonable.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $8,000 if he really values the product."
