{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential concessions. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850000. How about we meet in the middle at $875000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
