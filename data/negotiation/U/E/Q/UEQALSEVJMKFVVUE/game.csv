,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate it, $100 is a bit out of my budget. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $88?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",95.0,Alice,5,
