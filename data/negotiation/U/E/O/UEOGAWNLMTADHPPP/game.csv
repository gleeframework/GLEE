"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $92.50 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about $88?  That's a fair compromise.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. $88 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $90? That's only $2 more than your last offer, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,5,
