,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I've already priced it lower than I'd like. I can meet you halfway, but I need $92.50 to make it worth my while.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?",88.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88.75 and $92.50, so I'll offer it to you for $90.625. This is my final concession, so I hope you can meet me here.",90.625,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90.62 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers at $89.68?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",89.68,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a fair price. I'll meet you at $89.68, but I need a slight premium for my time and effort. I'll offer it to you for $90.00",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've been patient with me, but $90 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to close the deal now, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $89.50?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",89.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll meet you at $89.50, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I'll offer it to you for $89.75",89.75,Alice,9,
