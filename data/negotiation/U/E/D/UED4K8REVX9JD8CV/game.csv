"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $14000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14000. It's the highest I can go at this time.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",15500.0,Alice,5,
