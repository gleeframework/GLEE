"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable item. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its worth. I'm offering it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit high. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must consider its true value and the market demand. After reviewing the numbers, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's worth and the market demand. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'd like to find a mutually beneficial price before we run out of time.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns about the negotiation window, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1062500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1062500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. Considering the negotiation window is getting tight, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm only going to go as low as $1075000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth and the market demand. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $1050000. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying the product from John for $1000000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
