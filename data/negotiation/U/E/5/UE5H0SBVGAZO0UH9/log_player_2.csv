Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $700,000, but I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000, but that's as low as I can go.

``` 

Alice is holding firm at $725,000. While we could try to push further, there's a risk she won't budge and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John at $1,500,000. Accepting $725,000 secures a reasonable price for the product."
