Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm prepared to make this a mutually beneficial transaction. I propose a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides leverage. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
