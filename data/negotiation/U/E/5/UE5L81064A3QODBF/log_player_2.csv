"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still above the product's worth to you ($100).  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than what the product is worth to you. You can likely negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and her latest offer of $95 is too high for you.  You've already made two counteroffers, and it's clear the negotiation isn't going to get you a better price. It's now more advantageous to buy from John for $100, as the additional cost is less than the potential risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially not reaching a deal."
