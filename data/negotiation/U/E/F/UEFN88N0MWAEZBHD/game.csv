"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a decision at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. While your initial offer is a bit too low for what I have in mind, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. How about we settle at $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my willingness to pay.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
