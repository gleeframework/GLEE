Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think.
