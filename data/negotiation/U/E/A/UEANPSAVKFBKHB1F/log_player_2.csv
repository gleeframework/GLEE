"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is still within my budget, leaving room for potential compromise."
