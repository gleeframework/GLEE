Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While unlikely, starting a bit higher than Bob's perceived value leaves a sliver of room for him to counter-offer, potentially getting closer to $150. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, there's no loss. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, it strategically balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
