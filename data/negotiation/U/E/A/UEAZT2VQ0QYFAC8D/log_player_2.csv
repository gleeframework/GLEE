"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your compromise and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. This would allow us to both walk away happy and close this deal.
