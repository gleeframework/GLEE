"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,000,000",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $1,050,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. This would allow us to both walk away happy and close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no further. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal",1075000.0,Bob,6,
