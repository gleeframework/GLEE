"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open in case you can find a better deal later."
