"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great opportunity for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to reflect your budget and our mutual desire to make this deal happen. This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's fair considering the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think we can do better than $1,050,000. How about we aim for $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel it's too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your eagerness to close this deal, and I share that enthusiasm. However, $950,000 is still not in the realm of what this product is truly worth for you.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering both your needs and the product's value, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is my absolute maximum for this deal. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiations."
