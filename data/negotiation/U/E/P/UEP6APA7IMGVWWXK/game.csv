"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
