"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm sure you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110, which is still above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer is a good starting point and allows for flexibility throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $65 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm also trying to keep the conversation friendly by mentioning finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's still a bit high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John for $120, and it ensures a sale.  It's time to close the deal."
