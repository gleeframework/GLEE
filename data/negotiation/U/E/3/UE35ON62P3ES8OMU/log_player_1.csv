"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This sets the stage for a negotiation and gives me room to move down.  I'm also keeping in mind the $1,000,000 offer from John, which is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's current offer. I want to see if we can meet in the middle without getting too close to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target within the remaining rounds.  I'm also aware that if I reach round 10 and don't make a deal with Bob, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm continuing to narrow the gap, offering $1,025,000. This is a smaller move than before, showing that I'm serious about making a deal, but still holding out for more than Bob's last offer. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $987,500 is getting very close to my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate. I believe it's better to accept this offer and secure the deal, rather than risk a stalemate and end up selling to John for $1,000,000."
