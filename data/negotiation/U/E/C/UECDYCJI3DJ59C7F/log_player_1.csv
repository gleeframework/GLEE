Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,500,000, I aim to maximize potential profit. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation. I can potentially lower the price if needed, while still earning more than my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, hinting at the potential for even greater worth than my minimum. This might incentivize Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point. I would monitor Bob's response and adjust my approach based on his reaction and any additional information I gather about his potential value for the product."
