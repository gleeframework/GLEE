Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Just below John's Price:** Offering it just below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob might be more inclined to buy it at $149 rather than risk losing it."
