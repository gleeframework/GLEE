"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This represents a significant step from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $880,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $960,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",960000.0,Alice,5,
