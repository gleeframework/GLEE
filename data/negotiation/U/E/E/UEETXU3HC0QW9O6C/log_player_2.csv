"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is more than his maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go lower."

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $880,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $960,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's not clear if further negotiation will bring Alice down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product, Bob should choose to buy from John for $800,000."
