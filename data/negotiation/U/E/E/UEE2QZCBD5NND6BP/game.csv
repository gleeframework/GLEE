"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be a good fit for me, but the price is a little high for my budget right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I offered. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
