Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
