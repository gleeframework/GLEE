Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to reinforce the product's value in Bob's mind.

By starting with a strong offer and clear communication, you increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price that's highly favorable to you."
