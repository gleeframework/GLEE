,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $17,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can we try $16,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,750. Can we try $16,000 again? I'm willing to make a final offer and meet you halfway from your last offer.",16000.0,Bob,6,
