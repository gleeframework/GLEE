"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that could be acceptable to both of us."
