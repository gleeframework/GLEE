"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $145 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go down to $130. How about we split the difference at $135?  It's still a great price for a product that's worth so much to you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay at $130.  Let's compromise and I'll get this from you. How about we do $130 and call it a day? ",130.0,Bob,4,
