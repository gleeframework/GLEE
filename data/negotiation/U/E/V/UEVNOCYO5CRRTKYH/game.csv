"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount for you, and it allows me to recoup a substantial portion of its value.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I'd like to discuss further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a more aggressive offer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market price I've been quoted by other sellers.",850000.0,Bob,4,
