"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm offering it for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its potential value. Let's discuss further and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her perceived value of $800,000."
