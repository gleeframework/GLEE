"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $775,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $760,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any higher.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $765,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",765000.0,Alice,5,
