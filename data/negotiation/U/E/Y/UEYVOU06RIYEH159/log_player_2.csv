"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and it's the maximum I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $975,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John, as I can save $175,000.  While I may be able to continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee that we'll reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether."
