Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay close to your target, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is my final offer in this range.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice has made it clear she won't go below $825,000. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, saving you $25,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to bridge that gap."
