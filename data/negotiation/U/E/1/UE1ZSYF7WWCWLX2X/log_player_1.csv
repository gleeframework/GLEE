{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 represents a significant discount from what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000."",

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at such a drastically low price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
