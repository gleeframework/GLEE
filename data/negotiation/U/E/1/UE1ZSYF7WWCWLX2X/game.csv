"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. To kick things off, I'd be willing to part with it for $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 represents a significant discount from what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $650,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  If you're serious about purchasing, I could consider $1,600,000. This offer stands as a sign of good faith, but I do need to see some movement on your end as well.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap.  I could go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you've raised your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one more compromise to close this deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1,350,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
