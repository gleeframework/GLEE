"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so I'll offer $10,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but no higher. This is my final offer.",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your limitations, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,600. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $10,600. I'm at my budget limit and I really need to stick to it. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. Can you reconsider and meet me at $10,700?",10700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $10,850, which is still below my original asking price. I hope you can reconsider and meet me at this price.",10850.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $10,600. I've reached my budget limit and I need to stick to it. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm sorry, but I think we've reached an impasse.",10600.0,Bob,10,
